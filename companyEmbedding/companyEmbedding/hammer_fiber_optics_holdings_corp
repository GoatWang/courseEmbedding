	ITEM 1. BUSINESS








	Our Corporate History and Background







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, under the name Recursos Montana S.A. The Companys principal activity was as a pre-exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the Company. During this time, the Company was deemed a shell company in the pre-exploration stage of our business and was ultimately unable to commence exploration activities.





	On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., whereby the Company acquired 100% of Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the Companys common stock equal 51% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the closing, and cash consideration to Tanaris in the aggregate amount of $350,000. Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithium-ion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications. On March 6, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.





	On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (HFOI), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the HFOI Shareholders). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders (the HFOI Shares) and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock (the HMMR Shares). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd. was formed in the State of Delaware on June 13, 2014.









	4










	On April 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a Plan of Merger (the Plan of Merger) under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Section 92A.180 to merge (the Merger) with our wholly-owned subsidiary Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. The Plan of Merger also provides for a 1 for 1,000 exchange ratio for shareholders of both the Company and Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp., which had the effect of a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of our common stock. Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 13, 2016 and, on April 14, 2016, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval.





	On May 3, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved our merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. Accordingly, thereafter the Companys name was changed and our shares of common stock began trading on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under our new ticker symbol HMMR as of May 27, 2016.






	Current Operations






	Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is an alternative telecommunications carrier that is poised to position itself as the premier provider of diversified dark fiber networking solutions as well as high capacity broadband wireless access networks in the New Jersey [Southern and Central region] and the Metro Philadelphia area. Our goal is to provide network access to under-served markets along the transatlantic landing corridors that contains the flexibility to deliver cutting edge solutions to data centers, carriers and other various communication providers, aggregators, enterprise and poorly served residential broadband customers.





	Despite the fact that the USA has literally millions of miles of fiber optic in the ground across this vast country, very little of the country actually enjoys the significant speeds that this technology has promised for decades now. This is due to the fact that delivering services to residences and small business enterprises in urban and semi-urban areas have proven over the years to be severely cost prohibitive for all the major service providers across the USA. Several companies selling services in the fiber optic industry will promise consumers that they can deliver fiber to them shortly and cost effectively, but in effect, this has barely happened and it is becoming more evident that such a scenario is bound to never happen. The one thing about this industry that is factual is that fiber and wireless technologies are on track to co-exist in the deployment of broadband services to the masses. The exponential growth of streaming media has driven massive demand by consumers but the unsolved last mile connectivity will slow this demand down to a snail pace and most consumers will simply only hear about how wonderful it is to enjoy true broadband capacity from the few that actually have been privileged to receive it. It is for this reason that that the Company was formed.





	WHAT IS DARK FIBER?





	Dark Fiber is optical fiber cable which has been set in place for anticipated future use in carrying network signals in the form of light, but is not yet lit by laser equipment intended to be placed on both ends for the purposes of creating data connectivity between points. The dark strands can be leased to customers who want to establish optical connections between their own locations or co-location facilities, utilizing their own network equipment and security protocols. The cable-laying industry is seeing accelerated growth once again. In a widely quoted statistic, the CRU Group research firm estimated 19 million miles of optical fiber were installed in the USA in 2011, the most since 2000. Even in the areas that were connected during the initial boom, there are new structures to be served and more are built every year. At the present time, fiber still only reaches a relatively small percentage of all the buildings in the country. With this buildout process ongoing, more customers than at any other point in history are looking for fiber solutions to connect their junction points into existing data transport substructures.





	WHY USE DARK FIBER?





	Purchasing LIT fiber services requires service providers to pay significantly higher prices and incremental costs for provisioned bandwidth as demand increases, which proportionally increases cost to the end consumer. Dark fiber solutions provide HMMR with the ability to upgrade from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps to 400 Gbps as technology evolves by simply installing the latest in Wavelength-Division Multiplexing [WDM] on a single dark fiber pair. This ensures that our products always have sufficient bandwidth planned to cater for the ever-expanding consumer demand for high capacity broadband services without the need to continually increase cost to consumers as bandwidth demand increases.

	LATENCY





	Latency is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another in a network and is commonly expressed in terms of milliseconds (ms). Latency can be a major factor in overall performance of broadband services and it is important that we have full control of its network end-to-end. By provisioning dark fiber, we have the ability to manage the amount of routers and switching services installed on its fiber backbone network which greatly reduces the potential of latency and improves the overall customer experience.





	THE INDUSTRY TODAY





	Fiber penetration in the local access network is still very limited, even in the developed parts of the USA and this is mainly due to the high cost of installation and maintenance of a fiber access network. Cable technology has evolved with ever-increasing data rates and remains the most popular wire line broadband technology in terms of subscriptions. Close to four-fifths of the United States is now connected in some form to the broadband internet universe with cable remaining the dominant mode of access across the continent-wide landmass. Despite this, a large component of this connectivity fails to deliver sufficient capacity to satisfy the high demand for bandwidth-intensive modern consumer applications.





	THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE SOLUTION





	The Company has taken advantage of deploying its last mile wireless technology over the latest DOCSIS 3.0 standard which is fundamentally what cable technology is based on. This strategy allows for the use of tried and tested methodology utilizing cable modems that are produced in bulk and are inexpensive off- the-shelf items. In all cases of its current deployment, consumers are enjoying the power that fiber optic services promised, however the USA has been notoriously slow to recognize and accept that this is the solution to solve inadequate last mile access. We have therefore decided to enter this market without the involvement and/or validation of the incumbent operators who, in our opinion, are all actively engaged in depreciating their existing massive legacy technology CAPEX commitments. We will operate our wireless broadcast solution in the 28 and 31GHz frequencies, providing as much as 2.5 Gbps of capacity per sector in the cell range [up to 10Gbps per tower]. Licensing for frequencies in these bands has been facilitated by StraightPath Communications (NYSE MKT. Symbol: STRP) who owns a large section of the 28GHz and 31 GHz Local Multipoint Distribution Service [LMDS] spectrum across the USA. Diagram 1 describes the architecture of the 28GHz and 31GHz access deployment as planned. We will purchase dark fiber [wherever possible] on the Terrestrial Fiber Backhaul networks as well as in the Metro Fiber rings. Fiber spurs will then be deployed from fiber breakout splitters to leased towers where the wireless broadband transmitters are located as indicated in the following diagram:

	The Access Network portion of the architecture described in Diagram 1 is the ultimate in the value proposition provided by the Company throughout the Eco-System. The components forming an integral part of this first to market and unique technology is more fully diagrammatically described in Diagram 2. The Hammer Wireless technology is licensed exclusively to the Company in the State of New Jersey.

	A SIMPLE AND PRACTICAL CONCEPT





	The concept is very easy to understand. A single tower is erected to serve an area of up to 10km in circumference and every roof top that is in range of, and can be seen from the tower [or high site] where the wireless technology is erected, can be served within less than two hours of an order being received and executed by us. This means no digging up of roads, pavements or lawns to reach a subscriber premises, rendering time to market substantially reduced over competing technologies. The system utilizes a combination of a tried and proven set of applications such as fiber optic backhaul and DOCSYS 3.0 technologies deployed in an innovative manner. The last mile connectivity is between a microwave receiver mounted at the customer premises and a microwave transmitter mounted on a tower or high site. The main advantage of a modern microwave system is its high immunity to interference, easy reconfiguration and quick time deployment to market. Thus it can be a practical alternative compared to the high cost and complicated logistics of deploying last mile fiber cable. The main drawback is that it requires line-of-sight just like a satellite network. The benefits of wireless microwave as a preferred last mile access solution has, however, fueled technological innovation in microwave research and the development of an advanced point-to-multipoint solution known as Hammer Wireless AIR has emerged. This ground-breaking innovation in microwave technology is now capable of delivering upwards of a 100Mbps of dedicated bandwidth to an end-user in a fast and easy deployment, unlocking a whole new array of revenue streams and consumer options for network operators such as Hammer. We manage our own ISP and Content Delivery Node [CDN] equipment from several data centers situated along the Metro Fiber rings, traversing city and suburban centers. This network topology will always be managed by us across the entire eco-system to ensure that costs are managed and curbed, and that quality is guaranteed throughout the entire distribution chain [see Diagram 3].

	MULTI DWELLING UNITS [MDU] INSTALLATION





	In cases where MDUs are selected, Diagram 4 displays a typical shared model where one Hammer Wireless AIR Metro Transceiver is utilized to provide the building with a high capacity broadband connection and the rest of the tenants are connected to this single connection by way of dedicated standard off the shelf cable modems. This is very typical of a cable plant where one feeder cable enters the building and is distributed to each apartment by way of cable splitters. The Hammer Wireless Transceiver will then provide a COAX cable run [or will utilize existing COAX cable runs] to each tenants apartment or office which represents a significantly optimized MDU model.

	DIAGRAM 4: TYPICAL MDU INSTALLATION SERVED BY SINGLE WIRELESS CONNECTION QUALITY OF SERVICE ASSURANCE





	A Single 28GHz Transceiver to the MDU provides all the bandwidth needed to deliver HDTV in both broadcast and Video-On-Demand mode, ultra high speed internet service as well as fixed voice services to each residential dwelling or corporate office suite.





	Due to the fact that the cable modems share in the pool of bandwidth per sector on each tower, the constant available bandwidth ensures that the subscriber enjoys the most enjoyable broadband and TV experience possible. When the network is at peak capacity which normally occurs around 5pm to 9pm at night, the system will automatically pull more capacity off the fiber backbone to ensure that a good customer experience is maintained at all times.

	SINGLE DWELLING UNITS [SDU] INSTALLATION





	The Company expects to connect many single-family homes to the high-speed broadband access network during the rollout of the Hammer Wireless network, especially those rebuilt following the devastation by the Sandy Super Storm during 2012, where many homes were left un-served. A single standard satellite dish with the Hammer Wireless technology transceiver connected to standard Off-The- Shelf modems and set top boxes is deployed for each household to enjoy all the multimedia services available today. Deployment is extremely quick and non-invasive to the customer.

	CONTENT ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT





	Hammer is able to provide access to a significant amount of TV &Video content via its relationship with select vendors and is therefore able to deliver content for a variety of languages and cultures alike. It is envisaged that the Company will provide a choice of 100 plus quality TV channels based on content from all over the globe. Video on Demand will be delivered utilizing the latest Over- The-Top [OTT] technologies and literally thousands of movie titles will be stored in the video storage area network at the main Company network operations center in New Jersey. This content is capable of being delivered to customers at the highest quality HD format due to the very high capacity bandwidth delivery mechanism of our Fiber Optic Backbone and the Hammer Wireless Access network. As per capita incomes start improving as a result of a better economic outlook, more people will be able to afford access to Hammer services in the region and it is as or more affordable than competitive offerings for similar speeds. Its large bandwidth capabilities with internet and data access speeds are capable of being delivered up to 100Mbps and more to the consumer. Diagram 6 indicates all the Multi-Media services capable of being delivered over the Hammer Wireless Hybrid Fiber network architecture.

	DIAGRAM 6: HAMMER MULTIMEDIA SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORM MARKET TERRITORIAL EXCLUSIVITY





	The concept of delivering multi-media services such as television, interactive TV, video on demand, internet and voice services is by no means unique to our solution and is a tried and tested methodology evident in hundreds of developed markets world-wide. What is abundantly unique is the way in which we deliver this multi-media content in these developed markets that are particularly poorly served and critically lacking in reliable cost-effective broadband service. The Hammer Wireless Access Technology has been awarded to Hammer on an EXCLUSIVE basis across the entire State of New Jersey, USA. Additional territories will be added to Hammers exclusivity on a case-by-case basis following successful deployment of New Jersey.





	INITIAL DEPLOYMENT IN THE 28GHz SPECTRUM IN NEW JERSEY





	According to the 20082012 American Community Survey, New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia, and is also the second-wealthiest U.S. State by median household income. We have elected to initially roll out the Hammer Wireless Access Network along the New Jersey Shore area, which is indicated by way of the orange circles. These circles represent the household and businesses in service range of the Hammer wireless transmitters. These areas have been carefully studied and scoped out as the first market that we will serve, due to its perfect Line-Of-Sight [LOS] characteristics and poorly served broadband coverage by incumbent operators. The coverage area falls within the licensed 28GHz LMDS spectrum of Straight Path Communications issued by the FCC, which is sub- licensed to the Company for deployment of the planned broadband wireless network.

	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS







	You should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. We believe these risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our results and business operations.









	Risks Associated with Our Business










	Our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted, if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate







	The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions. Our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products and services, or upgrades of current products and services, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products, services and markets, if they do not continue as in the recent past, could have an adverse impact on our operations:





	·


	our ability to introduce leading products such optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, at competitive prices;


	·


	our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws.









	12












	We rely on contract manufacturing of our products. Our inability to secure production sources meeting our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements, or failures by our contractors to perform, could harm our sales and reputation.







	We source our products from international manufacturers. As a result, we must locate and secure production that meets our demands. We depend on our manufacturers to maintain adequate financial resources and maintain sufficient development and manufacturing capacity. We do not have material long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers, and these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. Our dependence on contract manufacturers could subject us to a number of risks if these manufacturers do not meet our quality, cost, working conditions and other requirements or if they fail to materially perform, any of which could seriously harm our sales and reputation. Further, if we need to place greater demands on our current manufacturers due to increased customer demands, or seek additional or replacement manufacturers, we may be unable to do so on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.







	Violation of labor laws and practices by our manufacturers and suppliers could harm our business.







	We require our manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While the Company promotes ethical business practices, we do not control our manufacturers or suppliers or their labor practices. The violation of labor or other laws by any of our manufacturers or suppliers, or divergence of their labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the local markets, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm the value of our trademarks, damage our reputation or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings.







	A privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationship with our customers, expose the Company to litigation risk and adversely affect our business.







	As part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. Despite security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose the Company to risks of litigation and liability and adversely affect our business.







	Our Articles of Incorporation exculpates our officers and directors from certain liability to our Company or our stockholders.







	Our Articles of Incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of our officers and directors for their acts or failures to act, except for acts involving intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This limitation on liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders from suing our officers and directors based upon breaches of their duties to our Company.







	Our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders, as such they will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting with the interests of other stockholders.







	Our directors and named executive officers are also our principal stockholders as such they exert significant influence in determining the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control of our business. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or entrenching management or the Board of Directors, which could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.







	The Companys independent auditors have issued a going concern opinion.







	The Companys ability to remain a going concern is highly dependent on its ability to raise sufficient debt and/or equity capital, among other things. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts.







	Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm.







	The Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.






	13










	We use electronic information technology (IT) in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets. Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.







	Business disruptions could affect our operating results







	A significant portion of our development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.







	If we cannot attract more optical customers to purchase our products, we may not be able to increase or sustain our revenues.







	Our future success will depend on our ability to migrate existing customers to our new products and our ability to attract additional customers. Some of our present customers are relatively new companies. The growth of our customer base could be adversely affected by:





	·


	customer unwillingness to implement our products and services;


	·


	any delays or difficulties that we may incur in completing the development and introduction of our products or product enhancements or service enhancements;


	·


	the overall satisfaction of our customers;


	·


	new product and service introductions by our competitors;


	·


	any failure of our products to perform as expected; or


	·


	any difficulty we may incur in meeting customers expectations.





	The fluctuations in the economy have affected the telecommunications industry, including broadband and Internet. Telecommunications companies have cut back on their capital expenditure budgets, which may continue to further decrease demand for various products and services. This decrease may have an adverse effect on the demand for fiber optic sector and negatively impact the growth of our customer base.






	Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities








	Our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.







	The stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies listed on the OTCPNK quotation system in which shares of our common stock are listed, have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:





	·


	variations in our operating results;


	·


	changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;


	·


	changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry;


	·


	additions or departures of key personnel; and


	·


	future sales of our common stock.





	Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.






	14












	Our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all.







	We cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained. Although the trading price of our common shares increased significantly recently, it has historically been sporadically or thinly-traded meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent.





	This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume. Even if we came to the attention of such persons, those persons tend to be risk-averse and may be reluctant to follow, purchase, or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.







	The market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses to you.







	Shareholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (1) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (2) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (3) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (4) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (5) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.







	We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders.







	We presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future. If payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future, it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock, if any, to implement our business plan; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future.







	Volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation.







	The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert managements attention and resources.






	15












	The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.







	Our Articles of Incorporation contains a specific provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to our company and shareholders. Further, we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Nevada law. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders.







	Our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.







	Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the United States Security & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS







	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections. We may use words such as anticipate, expect, intend, plan, believe, foresee, estimate and variations of these words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted. You should read this Report completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward looking statements included in this Report are made as of the date of this Report and should be evaluated with consideration of any changes occurring after the date of this Report. We will not update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future and we assume no obligation to update any forward- looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.






	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily continue into the future.





	Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.






	Overview






	The company was incorporated on September 23, 2010 pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Recursos Montana


	S.A. On March 6, 2015 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holding, Inc. On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company or TPHX) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (HFOI), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the HFOI Shareholders). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, closed on July 19, 2016, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.





	The Company was originally organized for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. As of this date, the Company had not established the existence of a commercially viable minable ore deposit and therefore did not reach the exploration stage. As such, the company negotiated to dispose of the business of investing in minerals in favor of developing new business opportunities in the technology sector. The company Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is now an alternative telecommunications carrier that is poised to position itself as the premier provider of diversified dark fiber networking solutions as well as high capacity broadband wireless access networks in the United States.








	Results of Operations







	The Year Ended July 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended July 31, 2015






	During the year ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 the Company has not earned any revenues.







	Operating Expenses







	During the year ended July 31st, 2016 the Company incurred total operating expenses of $1,999,581 compared with total operating expenses of $453,444 during the year ended July 31st, 2015. The increase in operating expenses is due to the increase in general and administrative costs because of the increased resources needed to complete the fiber optic network as well as an increase in depreciation expense from the fixed assets purchased year ended July 31st, 2015 and depreciated in year ended July 31st, 2016.






	18












	Interest Expense







	During the year ended July 31, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $201,684 compared to $0 in the prior period. This increase is attributable entirely to the consolidated interest expenses incurred by our subsidiary acquisition in the normal course of business.










	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	The Company has funded its operations and capital investments from debt and equity capital provided by investors since inception. The Companys ongoing operating costs are presently substantially comprised of labor and benefits, technical support and other third-party consulting fees. In addition, the Company procures capital equipment in the further development and construction of its technology platform. As the Company has no operating revenues, the ability to sustain ongoing operations, as well as to further expand the technology platform necessary to generate revenues, and therefore cash, is highly dependent upon the ability to raise additional debt and/or equity capital. The company has various initiatives in progress to achieve these objectives however no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful.





	There are no contractual commitments for capital expenditures as the Company cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient liquidity to honor such commitments.







	Going Concern







	As at July 31, 2016, the Company has a going concern assumption as the Company has earned no revenue, has no certainty of earning revenues in the future, has a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit since inception. The Company will require additional financing to continue operationseither from management, existing shareholders, or new shareholders through equity financing. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM













	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Hammer Fiber Optic Investments, Ltd.





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Hammer Fiber Optic Investments, Ltd. as of July 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hammer Fiber Optic Investments, Ltd. as of July 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As July 31, 2015, the Company had not generated any revenues since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $459,957 as of July 31, 2015. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	HAMMER FIBER OPTICS HOLDINGS CORP.



	(formerly known as Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.)


	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	JULY 31 2016 and 2015






	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS






	Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. (formerly Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.) is an alternative telecommunications carrier that is poised to position itself as the premier provider of high capacity broadband through its wireless access network in the New Jersey [Southern and Central region] and the New Jersey Shore. Our goal is to provide network access to under-served markets along the transatlantic landing corridors that contains the flexibility to deliver cutting edge solutions to data centers, carriers and other various communication providers, aggregators, enterprise and poorly served residential broadband customers. In addition, the Company has a clear expansion plan to strategically partner with existing Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISP) to bring its Hammer Wireless technology to rural markets across the country.






	NOTE 2  CORPORATE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND ON MERGER






	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, under the name Recursos Montana S.A. The Companys principal activity was as an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties then owned by the Company.





	On February 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., whereby the Company acquired 100% of Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. issued and outstanding common stock in exchange for shares of the Companys common stock equal to 51% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. was the owner of certain rights in connection with the marketing and sale of smart lithium-ion batteries and battery technologies for various industrial vehicles markets and related applications. On March 6, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc.





	On April 25, 2016, Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Hammer Fiber Optics Investments, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (HFOI), and the controlling stockholders of HFOI (the HFOI Shareholders). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of HFOI from the HFOI shareholders (the HFOI Shares) and in exchange the Company issued to the HFOI Shareholders 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of its common stock (the HMMR Shares). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, HFOI shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.





	On April 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a Plan of Merger (the Plan of Merger) under Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Section 92A.180 to merge (the Merger) with our wholly-owned subsidiary HFO Holdings, a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc. to Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The Plan of Merger also provides for a 1 for 1,000 exchange ratio for shareholders of both the Company and HFO Holdings, which had the effect of a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of our common stock. Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 13, 2016 and, on April 14, 2016, this corporate action was submitted to FINRA for its review and approval.





	On May 3, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved our merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, HMMR Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. (HFO Holdings). Accordingly, thereafter the Companys name was changed and our shares of common stock began trading under our new ticker symbol HMMR as of May 27, 2016. The merger was effected on July 19

	th

	2016 as the terms of the merger execution were met with the filing of the Super 8-K which was filed with the SEC on July 21st.

	The accompanying financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).





	The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements; the Company does not present the disclosure requirements of Topic 915.






	F-7












	Use of estimates







	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.







	Start-up costs







	In accordance with ASC 720, 

	Start-up Costs,

	the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company.







	Cash and cash equivalents







	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.







	Property and equipment







	Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. For furniture and fixtures, the useful life is five years, Leasehold Improvements are depreciated over the two- year lease term. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.







	Capitalized software Costs







	The Company accounts for software development costs which consist of costs to develop software programs to be used to meet the Companys internal needs in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1,

	Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

	. Costs incurred during the application development stage for software programs are capitalized. These costs consist primarily of direct costs incurred for professional services provided by third parties and compensation costs of employees which relate to software developed for internal use during the application stage. Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of development and the post-implementation stage are expensed in the periods when they are incurred. Capitalized software costs are included in property and equipment, net and will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. The Company has not yet completed its application stage of the software and will assess the estimated useful life upon completion.







	Impairment of long-lived assets







	The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company has not recognized impairment losses.







	Notes Receivable







	These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are recorded at amortized cost less any provision for impairment. Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default.






	F-8












	Indefinite lived intangible assets







	The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. The Company did not record any impairments during 2016.





	The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2016.







	Revenue recognition







	The Companys revenues consist primarily of subscription agreements for its broadband internet, phone and video services. Services are monthly to subscribers. The company recognizes revenues when cash payment for services is received. Revenue is recognized after service is provided and the customer has accepted the goods.







	Research and development costs







	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.







	Income taxes







	The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of July 31, 2016, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.







	Fair value measurements







	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.





	The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.





	ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:





	Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities





	Level 2  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3  inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)





	The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.






	F-9












	Consolidation of financial statements







	Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. is the parent company and sole shareholder of Hammer Wireless Corporation. Hammer Wireless Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. The financial statements for Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary are reported on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.







	Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share







	The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.







	Recent accounting pronouncements







	The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.






	NOTE 4  GOING CONCERN






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenue since inception and has sustained an accumulated loss of $2,641,166 for the period from inception to July 31, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to increase revenues and its ability to receive capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.





	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.





	Company management plans to address these going concerns by raising additional capital through the sale of equity until such time that ongoing revenues can sustain the business, at which time capitalization will be considered through other avenues, such as institutional financing for future projects.








	NOTE 5  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT






	As of July 31, 2015, property and equipment consisted of:

	Depreciation expense was $297,457 and $5,130 for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.






	NOTE 6  INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS






	There were no indefinite lived intangible assets recognized in 2015. There were $18,943 of recognized indefinite lived intangible assets. These assets are not amortized and are evaluated yearly for impairment. If a determination is made that the intangible asset is impaired after performing the initial qualitative assessment, the assets fair value will be calculated and compared with the carrying value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized.






	NOTE 7  NOTES PAYABLE






	During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, the Company entered into guaranteed investment agreements with 15 individuals (investors). In connection with the agreements the investors loaned the Company an aggregate of $85,000, and will be issued an aggregate of 154,500 shares of the Companys common stock upon the initial share distribution of the Company. Upon the Company obtaining investment funding of $1,500,000, the Company will repay the invested amounts. The Company has accounted for the shares to be issued as interest expense and has accrued interest on the amounts. The shares to be issued have been valued based on the price per share that the Company is offering its common stock in a private placement at $0.01 per share. As of July 31, 2015 the balance of the loans payable was $83,000. During the period from inception to July 31, 2015, the Company has accrued $1,280 of interest on these agreements. These loans were paid back in fiscal year 2016.





	The Company entered into two guaranteed loan agreements with a member of its board of directors and a stockholder (Lender) for an aggregate amount of $285,000. On April 24, 2015, the Company repaid the loans, net of a discount of $20,000 in the amount of $265,000. In accordance with ASC 470-50-40-2 the gain on the extinguishment of debt with the related party of $20,000 has been recorded as an equity transaction. Interest accrued on these loans was $2,850 for the year ending July 31, 2015.





	During the current fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into two promissory note with a related party (Lender) for an aggregate amount of $2,400,000 and $1,000,000 respectively. The $2,400,000 matures on December 31,


	2018. The terms of the loan consist of 10 principal and interest payments made quarterly in the amount of $300,000 giving the loan a $3,000,000 payback at the date of maturity. As of July 31, 2016 the Company had a balance of $2,700,000. The $1,000,000 loan matures on June 9th, 2018 at which point the Company will pay the full principal plus 3% interest which shall accrue until the loan becomes payable.





	On January 20, 2016, The Company entered into a financing agreement with a third party whereby the Company acquired equipment in exchange for a note payable, with a maturity date of November 1, 2017. The balance of this note was $42,062 as of July 31, 2016.






	NOTE 8  NOTES RECEIVABLE






	During fiscal year ended July 31st, 2016 the company entered into a loan agreement with MEK Investments Inc. for an aggregate amount of $235,000. The Company is set to recover the loan amount plus 3% interest through a payback of the loan by or on its maturity date of June 30th, 2018.





	The Company also entered into an agreement with Zena Capital LLC for the aggregate amount of $1,000,000. ZENA shall repay the loan at a rate of $185,000 per month for 5 months with a final payment of $75,000 in month 6 plus accumulated interest. Zena is currently in default on this agreement.

	NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES






	Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense.





	The reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, to the Companys effective tax rate is as follows:

	The Company has approximately $2,188,099 of net operating losses (NOL) carried forward to offset taxable income in future years which expires in fiscal 2036. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.






	NOTE 10  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY








	Authorized stock







	On January 4, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an additional class of shares, Class A shares and Class B shares. Class A shares carried redemption rights at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, with no fixed redemption date and no voting rights. Class A shares were redeemable at their face value prior to any declared dividends becoming payable to holders of Class B shares. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company issued 2,092,996 Class A shares and 2,092,996 Class B shares for proceeds of $3,028,989.

	F-12










	On April 25, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Tanaris Power Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded company, with the intent to effect a merger. Prior to a merger with Tanaris Power Holdings, the Company authorized and issued 50,000,000 Class B shares with a par value of $0.00001 per share. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Tanaris was to acquire 20,000,000 Class B shares in exchange for 50,000,000 (post-Merger) restricted shares of Tanaris.

	Following the merger, the Company now has 60,503,341 common shares outstanding with a par value of $0.001 per share. The Class A shares have been redeemed and converted to Class B common stock and as a result, the company currently has only one class of common stock.

	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	None











	ITEM 9A(T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES








	Managements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	As of July 31, 2016, the end of the fiscal period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer, with the participation of our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.







	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of July 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.





	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only managements report in this annual report.







	Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls







	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.







	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended July 31, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE








	Related Party Transactions







	None of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known to own beneficially more than 5% of the Companys outstanding shares of its common stock, nor any associate or affiliate of such persons or companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past two fiscal years, or in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company.





	With regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions in the following manner:





	·


	Disclosing such transactions in reports where required;


	·


	Disclosing in any and all filings with the SEC, where required;


	·


	Obtaining disinterested directors consent; and


	·


	Obtaining shareholder consent where required.







	Director Independence







	For purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). The OTCBB on which shares of the Companys Common Stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of Independent Director means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.





	Under the definitions outlined it is our opinion that Dennis Doll and Donald MacNeil are independent directors.







	Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons







	We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.











	ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES






	The company employs Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Prior to engaging our accountants to perform a particular service, our board of directors obtains an estimate for the service to be performed. All of the services described above were approved by the board of directors in accordance with its procedures.





	Below is the aggregate amount of fees billed for professional services rendered by our principal accountants with respect to our last two fiscal years:

	Maintaining Principal Accountants Independence

	Wireless Broadband System providing rural Southern New Jersey Consumers with 
	better Internet Connectivity and greater Bandwidth

	 




	 

Mark 
	Stogdill


	President and CEO

 


	Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp.


	(OTC: HMMR)



www.hammerfiber.com 


 


	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine
 


CEOCFO: Mr. Stogdill, according to 
	your site, the broadband evolution has arrived. What does that mean at 
	Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings Corp? How are you part of it or maybe 
	initiating the evolution? 


Mr. Stogdill:  
Hammer Fibers 
	entire platform is centered around a tremendous broadband experience. 
	Globally the US has always been considered to be at the forefront of data 
	technology and internet service when compared to other countries. In truth, 
	that presumption doesnt necessarily extend to national broadband access. 
	There still is a very large percentage of the country that is using a 
	substandard type of internet connectivity. All but really the most highly 
	developed parts of the US are still without fiber optics. There are a great 
	many rural locations throughout all of the United States, and even in 
	Southern Jersey where we have our operations, that are getting service that 
	is either running off of legacy copper or hybrid fiber/copper cable systems. 
	This is essentially lower capacity plant that was placed several years ago 
	or longer in some cases. People are still paying high premiums for this 
	service and not getting the type of bandwidth that they need. Bandwidth 
	demand in todays market is being driven by streaming media and, even more 
	recent, the Internet of Things where all of the devices in our home are now 
	connected. Bandwidth usage is increasing year over year as a result and 
	capacity planning becomes an issue for most networks. I dont think any 
	customer should be left behind.  
 


CEOCFO: How does Hammer Fiber create a 
	different experience? 


Mr. Stogdill: 
Hammer Fibers 
	differs from other wireless and fixed-line service providers because of our 
	revolutionary last mile architecture, which is comprised of a wireless 
	system which we call Hammer Wireless. Hammer Wireless replaces the last mile 
	access network in a traditional cable model with high capacity wireless end 
	links that overcome many of the challenges all major operators are faced 
	with today. Instead of using old copper or incurring the massive capital 
	expenditure of building fiber to the home, what we do is use our wireless 
	technology to provide service directly to the consumer over a short distance 
	from a wireless base station is that fed from a fiber backbone. As a result 
	of this type of convergence, the system can push fiber-like speeds from the 
	base station to a high number of end points. Many people live in rural or 
	suburban markets that only have perhaps one provider who is providing their 
	services through older types of plant. The customer is still paying a very 
	high market price for that, but they are getting a lot of these up to 
	speeds, that never really hit their advertised marks. At least not enough to 
	satisfy the bandwidth demand of most modern consumers. What we do is we push 
	as much bandwidth as the customer needs in a fully burstable internet model, 
	so that as the customer is initiating new IP requests they are drawing 
	bandwidth out of a very large pool of bandwidth, so that they are never 
	without enough bandwidth to run all the many different applications and all 
	the many different devices off of the same modem in their home. We see this 
	system as a solution to a very salient market problem.  

 


CEOCFO: You said they are drawing 
	bandwidth from a large pool. Does that mean you have a lot of capacity?


Mr. Stogdill: 
One of the things 
	that Hammer does that is a little bit different in the business space as it 
	currently stands, is we do not use contention ratios in our access network. 
	That translates to no oversubscription on the wireless system. It 
	essentially means that service does not slow down during peak usage hours. 
	The throughput on the network is always high and the bandwidth is always 
	there on demand. Many customers complain about experiences with their 
	providers and it always seems to be the same complaint. Seven oclock at 
	night they are home with their family watching some type of streaming 
	service and they experience buffering or they experience packet loss where 
	pixels are dropping out of the frame. With Hammer customers we are 
	continually pushing very large amounts of bandwidth, both in non-peak and 
	peak times, so that the experience is very consistent and smooth, no matter 
	when you are using it. 

 


CEOCFO: Has the wireless component been 
	tried previously? What are the challenges in making it workable? 



Mr. Stogdill: 
It has been tried 
	before, to not much overall success but it is clearly still where it is all 
	going. Recently it has been in the press that several major providers, 
	companies that you have heard of, are running into traditional fiber access 
	challenges. Therefore everyone, from the biggest players in the market to 
	the smallest, are looking for some type of wireless advantage. What 
	differentiates our product is that it runs a full DOCSIS spec. It feels and 
	operates exactly like a traditional cable system and we are able to 
	aggregate as much bandwidth as a traditional direct fiber or direct copper 
	connection would generate, so that from the customer experience side it is 
	almost invisible to the customer that they are using a wireless product. At 
	this point most of the wireless technology being deployed is wireless 
	backhaul or PTP connections. Wireless in this day and age can be so much 
	more than just doing information backhauling. It can actually be used to go 
	direct to the consumer. Our technology takes all of the best elements of 
	some of the existing technologies and provides an actual access system that 
	can run off of a wireless connection that provides wired-like service. This 
	means that the customer gets all of that fixed-line service experience 
	without all of the issues of having to build out a full cable plant; digging 
	up roads, right of ways and all that type of stuff.

 


CEOCFO: Could you license the technology 
	to larger companies that are having problems? 


Mr. Stogdill: 
We certainly can 
	and we are in the process of working on a platform so that we can make this 
	product ubiquitous and that everyone, especially rural operators who are 
	right now deeply entrenched in these types of access challenges, can utilize 
	this technology and deployment architecture to really drive their own 
	subscriber base and create a much higher quality of service than they can 
	currently offer on their current generation technology. That is definitely 
	part of our plans. 

 


CEOCFO: Does anyone care if it is a 
	wireless component as long as the service is working well? Does wireless 
	have any negative connotation in this arena these days? 



Mr. Stogdill: 
I dont think 
	there is quite the same stigma these days on wireless distribution as there 
	was a few years ago. Much of the industry and most of the consumers are 
	already thinking that way. With satellite and cellular technologies being 
	universally recognized at this point, I think most people sort of expect 
	that the next generation of connectivity to the home is going to come from 
	some form of wireless platform. For us, the challenge is overcoming some of 
	the negative stereotypes that have existed in the market space from previous 
	attempts at wireless-to-the-home such as WiMAX. There also could be 
	confusion about our product being equated with satellite. Satellite has its 
	own challenges in terms of product branding to consumers. However, the 
	difference with us is that this is a fully terrestrial network. Our network 
	architecture is bringing all of the power of fiber to very strategic 
	locations and then shooting this wireless signal over a very short, 
	condensed range. This overcomes many of the obstacles that, for instance, 
	satellite has experienced with latency and rain fade. At the end of the day 
	the customer is going to be mostly concerned about the quality of their 
	service. People are willing to take a chance on different types of 
	technology as long as the end result is what they are looking for. I think 
	with this product it will meet or exceed all of the customers expectations. 
	The fact that there is a wireless component to the system shouldnt dissuade 
	the many customers who are really looking for a better internet service.
	

 


CEOCFO: Will you be selling direct 
	to the customer? What is the ultimate business model?


Mr. Stogdill: 
Selling direct to 
	the customer is the primary platform. We have approximately four hundred 
	miles of fiber connectivity throughout New Jersey which feeds our wireless 
	base stations. Presently we are testing this product on Absecon Island, 
	which is Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and Long Port. We have wireless 
	base stations already deployed in these markets and are in the final stage 
	of beta testing the system. We have customers on the network now and the 
	experience has been very positive. By the end of the year we are looking for 
	a full commercial launch in Atlantic City, Ventnor and Margate. As the 
	program matures we are going to be looking to move into adjacent markets as 
	well as markets throughout the state where it makes sense for us to roll the 
	service out. Although we are working behind the scenes on a variety of 
	service platforms in an array of verticals, we are an operator first and 
	foremost and we are looking to provide the service directly to the consumer. 
	That said, there are many other possibilities with the technology that we 
	are actively pursuing. 

 


CEOCFO: What have you learned as you have 
	been testing the product? 


Mr. Stogdill: 
I think the most 
	important lesson is that there really is a need for competitive diversity; 
	that alternatives to the existing marketplace, specifically how people are 
	getting their internet and phone and video service, is genuinely something 
	that consumers, by and large, are craving. There seems to be a bit of 
	complacency in terms of content and IP delivery throughout the country. 
	Customers are continually looking for better and better experiences. They do 
	not just want to be a number. They want to have their service issues matter. 
	They want to have them addressed immediately. Customer service is a huge 
	priority for us. It is very important that we build relationships with our 
	customers, that they understand that their quality of service matters to us 
	and that we seek and strive to do everything we can to provide them with the 
	best service possible. We are finding there is a shift in thinking and more 
	customers than ever are holding their service providers accountable. 
	Additionally, we are discovering there are still markets in this country, 
	even ones just outside of major metropolitan areas, where the service 
	offerings are far below the par for what it should be in this day and age. 
	There is still room for the industry to improve as a whole and we are 
	looking to play our part in driving a better bandwidth service. 


 


CEOCFO: You hear talk often about the 
	rural markets and the underserved markets, but it seems that nothing ever 
	gets done. How is Hammer Fiber really going to make it happen? Why are you 
	confident where no one else seems to have succeeded? 



Mr. Stogdill: 
It is easy for 
	companies to say that theyve found a solution when the bulk of their 
	subscribers are plucked from the density of metro markets. It is easy to 
	say, Okay, we are going to expand out and we are going to dedicate 
	resources and we are going to build a better product. However, the truth of 
	the matter is the product has not arrived yet. In most publicized cases it 
	may take years to arrive, if ever. One of the reasons we can do this and do 
	it now, is that we have a product ready. We arent in the trenches trying to 
	develop the solution. Its already here and its one that is extremely well 
	suited to specifically serve these types of communities at a very low cost 
	factor. In fact, we can provide the same quality of service to a metro 
	customer as we can to a rural customer and there is really no difference 
	across the platforms. Using a wireless distribution system as opposed to all 
	of the hassle of building out a cable network, allows us to deploy these 
	base stations in many more regions and reach many more customers in shorter 
	amounts of time. Executing this type of game plan really comes down to the 
	right product. We have the right product to address these needs and we are 
	making it a very big focal point of our platform. 

 


CEOCFO: Will potential customers 
	understand? Do people care? 


Mr. Stogdill: 
There are two 
	sides to this coin. First, we hope that the industry really takes notice of 
	how to move forward in these markets that have been traditionally 
	underserved. We want the industry to notice how we are doing this and we 
	seek to lead the charge for the next generation of hybrid wired and wireless 
	deployments. However, I also think that from just your everyday consumers 
	perspective they are mostly interested in the service hitting the high notes 
	they expect. We win customers through quality of service. They may not be 
	interested in how we got there, or what we do behind the scenes to make it 
	all happen for them. The aim isnt to dazzle anybody with the back office 
	network stuff.  Its to provide great service. At the end of the day Im not 
	sure it matters to them how it gets there.  

 


CEOCFO: What did you learn from 
	Verizon that has helped you at Hammer Fiber Optics Holdings? 



Mr. Stogdill: 
I think that 
	Verizon, for the size company it is, is a very well run organization. It has 
	a great game plan. Its FTTP service was designed to provide the type of 
	bandwidth that we talked about previously, and where it is deployed, its 
	seems to be a huge success. Like any major operator it is burdened surely by 
	the volume of customers it has and needs to serve. I think, if anything, 
	that although I get the still relevant principals of using fiber, in terms 
	of using the traditional plant to create access pieces on portions of your 
	network, I see the downside. It seems to me building fiber out to every home 
	is an untenable proposition, one that is costly both in time and resources. 
	Some of Verizons fiber initiatives have stalled out in certain markets and 
	I imagine it comes down to the return on their investment. What we have 
	learned is that wireless is sort of moving that ROI in the right direction 
	while still maintaining the same types of service levels.   

 


CEOCFO: How are you able to perhaps 
	be better in weather situations and with electricity surges? In some of what 
	is uncontrollable and often not handled well from traditional providers, are 
	there advantages in your approach? 


Mr. Stogdill: 
At the end of the 
	day the internet is a best efforts practice. I think there has been a lot of 
	disillusionment on the customer side when the internet does fail for any 
	reason, that there is a notion that service should never fail and that the 
	operators are not doing enough to rectify the problem. This is an 
	unrealistic expectation but its compounded by the fact that the operators 
	really are not doing enough, and there should be a greater focus on customer 
	service and minimizing down time should be the central theme of any consumer 
	grade platform. That has to be the first and foremost objective; to 
	continually maintain and operate the network in a way that we ensure we are 
	being as responsive as possible to any types of blips or burps in the 
	distribution, so that we can react very quickly to the market, that we 
	understand that every second a customer is down is a growing inconvenience 
	to them and that ultimately what we need to do is to take responsibility for 
	putting each one of them back in service promptly. As far as the technology 
	goes we are getting very a high quality of service rating in all different 
	types of weather. The reliability is as good or better than just about any 
	product out there. However, like any system you will experience outages. 
	What we are trying to do as a platform, as a business, is focus intensely on 
	customer service and customer response time. We do that by trying to create 
	shorter windows of response. We are trying to create an atmosphere and a 
	culture within the business that the customer needs to always come first and 
	that it is our priority. We want to relay that message back to them by 
	example. We want to demonstrate through action that when we say customer 
	service matters that customer service truly matters.      

 


CEOCFO: Would you tell us about being a 
	public company, how that may have changed Hammer, what the reception has 
	been in the marketplace and then why people should invest? 



Mr. Stogdill: 
From a 
	corporate perspective, everything has naturally changed. From a business 
	strategy standpoint, nothing really has. The goals are still the same. The 
	move to go public was very important in order to create visibility in the 
	financial markets as we simultaneously seek to gain visibility in the 
	consumer markets to what we are doing and how we are doing it. We felt it 
	was time to responsibly grow the business and move it forward. We now have 
	access to larger capital markets and a more diverse pool of investors. We 
	also wanted to create a liquidity event for our shareholders. Many of the 
	original employees are shareholders so this way we can add some extra value 
	to their immense efforts. We take the responsibility of being public very 
	seriously. We were originally funded by private investors who placed great 
	faith in our ability to execute and we carry that with us every day and that 
	commitment has only grown since going public. We owe it to them to see the 
	vision through to complete success. If anything it has made us very 
	conscious about the impact of our products and services. We are really 
	looking to drive these markets where there is a lot of opportunity so we can 
	build value and reward that faith.





	 

	 


	Bandwidth demand in todays market is being driven by streaming media and, 
	even more recent, the Internet of Things where all of the devices in our 
	home are now connected. Bandwidth usage is increasing year over year as a 
	result and capacity planning becomes an issue for most networks. I dont 
	think any customer should be left behind.- Mark Stogdill

                    	I've been using Hammer Fiber for some time now. I am extremely happy with the service, I stream to my 3 TV's and have numerous other connected devices as well as Smart Home devices online at all times. I have never had any issue bandwidth. It's true when they tell you, you get what you need. Keep up the great work and service.
