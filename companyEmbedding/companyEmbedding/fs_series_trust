Moore Industries FS Functional Safety Series - Products you can trust for your safety applications07 July 2015Safety engineers need to know that they can rely on their instrumentation to maintain safe process operations while warning them or preventing possible hazardous conditions. It’s not enough for products to say they work – engineers need proof of their reliability and applicability in safety settings.Moore Industries created the FS Functional Safety Series to give peace of mind to safety engineers when implementing instrumentation in safety applications. These products have been designed and built to strict IEC 61508 standards, ensuring safe and reliable function – particularly in environments where hazardous or emergency situations are likely to occur. This can assist engineers looking to add a single safety loop, isolating a few points or augmenting a larger Safety Instrumented System (SIS).  Designing instruments in accordance with the IEC 61058 standard from the ground up forces the components, any related firmware and circuit design to undergo additional scrutiny that ensures the highest level of reliability. Leading third-party safety auditing firm exida audits Moore Industries products and processes to ensure they are in compliance with the IEC 61508 standard. With this certification, end users can rely on FS Functional Safety Series instruments to perform as expected and when demanded.  Current products in the FS Functional Safety Series:  SSX and SST Functional Safety Isolators and Splitters: The SSX and SST protect safety systems by isolating an SIS from basic process control or monitoring systems so that disconnections or other failures don’t impact the safety system. Unlike standard isolators they also allow the passing of valuable HART data between critical field transmitters and HART enabled host monitoring systems.  The products are certified by exida for use in an SIS up to SIL 3 in monitor mode, where only the input circuit is part of the safety function. For single use mode, the SSX/SST is approved for use in an SIS up to SIL 2.  STA Safety Trip Alarm: SIL 3 capable and certified by exida, the STA is a single-loop logic solver that acts on hazardous process conditions, provides emergency shutdown and provides on/off control in Safety Instrumented Systems.  A few or multiple STAs are often used as a cost effective logic solver strategy where larger and more complex safety PLCs or control systems are cost prohibitive or too complex.   SRM Safety Relay Module: The versatile relay repeater module has been certified by exida to SIL 2. It accepts single contact closure inputs from safety logic solvers or other alarm units including the STA. Unlike many other interposing relays, the SRM is a Force Guided Relay, avoiding the possibility of not knowing when contacts have become stuck or welded in position due to unexpected higher than normal switching loads.
