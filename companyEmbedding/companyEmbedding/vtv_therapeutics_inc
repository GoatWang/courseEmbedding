Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Company ProfilevTv Therapeutics LLC (vTv) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of human therapeutics to fill unmet medical needs. Our mission is to advance clinical drug candidates discovered with our innovative technology into safe and effective medicines.
vTv has a pipeline of small molecule clinical and pre-clinical drug candidates for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases including central nervous system disorders, metabolic disorders, inflammation and cancer. The company has built its product candidate portfolio through internal discovery and is advancing its product candidates through in-house research and development efforts. The quality and breadth of vTv's product candidate pipeline, platform technology, scientific team and strategic collaborations have enabled it to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. The company's commitment to drug discovery is reflected in its medical solutions and the many exciting potential new treatment options in its pipeline. The company's major R&D activities have focused on central nervous system disorders, metabolic disorders, inflammation and oncology. vTv is advancing several proprietary drug candidates. The company's lead candidate, azeliragon (aka TTP488), is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule compound that is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, azeliragon showed a statistically significant difference of more than 3 points in ADAS-cog at 18 months compared to placebo.Azeliragon has been granted Fast Track Designation and agreement on its Phase 3 protocol has been reached with FDA via a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). The Phase 3 study in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease was initiated in April 2015 with a clear path forward to registration with the aim to demonstrate disease modification. vTv is also prosecuting the clinical development of TTP399, a novel functionally liver-selective Glucokinase Activator ("GKA") for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In a Phase 2a study, TTP399 normalized patients' HbA1c without inducing hypoglycemia, after only six weeks of treatment. A six-month Phase 2 study is ongoing. In addition to TTP488 and TTP399, the vTv pipeline includes:
 • TTP273: the first orally available GLP1R agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Phase 2 • HPP593: a PPARδ agonist for the prevention of muscle weakness associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and critical injury • HPP737: a PDE4 inhibitor for inflammatory diseases • HPP971: a Bach1 inhibitor in phase I being developed for inflammatory/immunology related diseases • Pre-clinical Hexokinase II inhibitors targeting cancer metabolism

HexoKinase II Inhibitors(Licensed to Calithera Biosciences, Inc.)Hexokinase II catalyzes the 1st step in glycolytic pathway (which is overexpressed in human cancer), and its overexpression correlates with poor patient survival. The use of aerobic glycolysis for ATP generation is unique to tumor cells. HK II plays a key role in generation of metabolites important for tumor growth and survival, including lactate, ATP, NADPH, glutathione. HK II is Important in suppression of apoptosis; HK II-bound to mitochondria is key for survival (anti-apoptosis) of tumor cells. Potent, specific HK II inhibitors with pharmaceutical properties are lacking.Utilizing TTP Translational Technology®, potent inhibitors of human HK1 and HK2 enzymes have been identified that inhibit of tumor cell growth (ovarian, lung, pancreas) and induce apoptosis in vitro. Inhibition of cellular HK2 enzyme causes a decrease in intracellular glucose 6-phosphate levels. Inhibition of HK2 leads to decreases in lactate, ATP and glutathione production in tumor cells; important metabolites for tumor cell growth and survival. Mitochondria membrane potential is decreased and redistribution of mitochondria-bound HK2 protein to the nucleus is observed. Inhibition of mTOR pathway is seen without inducing autophagy. Targeting accelerated glycolysis in cancer cells is a new promising modality for treatment of cancer.Inhibition of glycolysis can be done without significant side effects, and such treatment will be additive to most known cancer therapies.  HK2 enzyme inhibitors have been identified and human tumor xenograft studies in models of ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancers are ongoing.
