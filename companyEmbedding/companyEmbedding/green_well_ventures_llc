It is agreed that any such amendment will apply to Customer. Greenbush Ventures LLC agrees to inform Customer of any amendment to the agreement. Should Customer fail to object to any amendment to the Agreement within one week, such failure shall serve as an acceptance of the amendment.
 1.2 We reserve the right to update or change these Terms at any time by posting the most current version of the Terms. We will provide notice of changes to the Terms by posting the new Terms on the Site with a new Effective Date shown. All such changes in the Terms shall be effective from the Effective Date set when it is posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Site or Services after we post any changes to the Terms signifies your agreement to any such changes. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must discontinue using the Site and Services.
1.3 By accessing the Site and Services you consent to have this Agreement provided to you in electronic form. 
1.4 You have the right to receive this Agreement in non-electronic form. You may request a non-electronic copy of this Agreement either before or after you electronically sign the Agreement. To receive a non-electronic copy of this Agreement, please send an e-mail to support@greenventureshealth.com  or send a letter and self-addressed stamped envelope to: Green Ventures Health
    8776 E Shea Blvd, Suite 106-614 
    Scottsdale, AZ 85260
1.5 Purchasing Products and Services. By accepting a risk free evaluation or making a purchase you agree to provide (i) true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the registration form, and (ii) maintain and properly update your account information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
2. CHARGES ON YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT
2.1  I, the cardholder, expressly agree to pay the full amount being charged to me upon checkout. I legally attest that information on this order form is true and correct and I am promising to pay the full amount owed.
2.2 If you purchase a risk free evaluation, We will bill you for your online account using the billing information you provide (your "Billing Account") for use of the Service and you agree to be responsible for return shipping of the product should you wish to cancel during your evaluation period. You agree to pay Us all charges at the prices then in effect for your use of the Service using your Billing Account, and any applicable taxes, and you authorize Us to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment and to update your information from available third party sources.
2.3 Recurring Billing. Access to the Service may consist of an initial period, where you can try a product risk free, followed by recurring periodic charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your risk free evaluation has an initial shipping and processing fee and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. To change or cancel your Service at any time, call our customer service representatives at 877-252-3242. Your products will be automatically shipped per the offer you originally accepted but you can change a shipment or product at any time by calling us at 877-252-3242. Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that We are authorized to charge your Payment Method. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL YOUR SERVICE OR NOTIFY US THAT YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.
2.4 YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT). IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE US ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

2.5 The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method (the "Payment Method Provider"). If we do not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all amounts, which may include lesser amounts which We will charge to your Account up to what is due on your Billing Account upon demand.

2.6 If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the current rate set forth in your initial offer due to an increase in our current rates (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), We shall provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your Payment Method Provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that We may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
2.7 Any evaluation or other promotion that provides introductory risk free access to Services must be used within the specified time of the evaluation as provided in the offer you accept. You must cancel your membership before the end of the evaluation period in order to avoid being charged a membership or other fee.
2.8 For assistance with billing-related issues please call us at 877-252-3242.
3. RETURNS, CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY
3.1  REFUND POLICY. All orders under $100 will be charged a non-refundable $4.95 shipping fee. Return products in their original, unopened package(s). Please call Customer Care at 877-252-3242 to make arrangement to receive Your refund. Shipping and handling fees are non-refundable.
3.3 You explicitly agree to the following statement: "I UNDERSTAND THAT I MAY BE LIABLE FOR PAYMENT OF FUTURE GOODS AND SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT IF I FAIL TO NOTIFY THE SUPPLIER NOT TO SUPPLY THE GOODS OR SERVICES DESCRIBED."
3.4 Refunds are given if refunds are promised over the phone. Refunds are given via phone only and transaction ID will be provided. Cancellation of one's account does NOT constitute a refund, only a valid refund transaction ID constitutes a refund. Cancellation of one's account cancels only future orders if you signed up on an auto-ship program, it does not give a refund for the current order. Refund on a current order must be requested directly and a valid refund transaction ID will be issued. Chargebacks or disputes based on a "Cancelled Recurring" reason code will only be awarded to a customer if a customer is issued a valid refund transaction ID for a refund, NOT a cancelled account. 
3.5 RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) numbers are required for all returns and are available upon request by calling customer service. RMA numbers will be issued within 2 business days. Returns are subject to a $14.95 restocking fee. Return products in their original, unopened package within 30 days of shipment to:

    P.O. BOX 4800 Scottsdale, AZ 
          
    Scottsdale, AZ 85261-4800
