From War In The Pacific, Right To Business
In 1946, immediately after his discharge from the Marines, Walter W. Gauer purchased, with his mustering-out pay, a surplus military truck and started a company with his brother Edward Gauer and machinist Eugene Wroble. Walter Gauer being the youngest and most agressive partner, began taking on the duties of sales along with running the deliveries during the day, then would join his partners and help process parts at night. The company began working primarily making hotplates, doing general machining, building bakery racks, early gravity flow (or carton flow) shelving, and conveyors.
Gauer Metal Products HQ Building
 
The First Carton Flow Manufacturer
Lansing Shields, President of Grand Union Co., applied for patents for the original gravity-feed rear load design using Unistrut and Nylon strips in 1945 (later approved in 1948). The unit consisted of several inclined runways, the device was driven by gravity. The concept was a stockman would place merchandise in the rear of each runway and, as a shopper selected an item, the item behind it would slide forward in place of the previous one.
Mr. Shields, being impressed with Walter Gauer as a young entrepreneur with a unique sales style, asked him if he and his partners had any interest in manufacturing his shelving concept. Mr. Gauer, realizing the potential of working with Mr. Shields, quickly discussed this with his partners and began manufacturing these carton flow units for Grand Union under Mr. Shields’s label of Food-O-Mat. When Lansing Shields died of a heart attack, Thomas Butler was appointed the new president of Grand Union. Butler had no interest in continuing to use carton flow units in Grand Union Supermarkets.
Food-O-Mat went off on its own to sell the product with Gauer as its manufacturer. This early work led to the eventual development of the Flo-Rak line of carton flow shelving systems. Still a leader in the carton flow industry, Gauer’s line of Flo-Rak products has maintained its impeccable name by always adhering to the GauerBuilt quality that Mr. Gauer instilled during the company’s inception.
A Simple Idea Sparks An Industry
In an effort to improve his own products, Walter Gauer recognized a need for “clean edges.” As metal working professionals know, slit coil and sheared plate often have sharp edges and burrs, Mr. Gauer envisioned a machine that would roll these dangerous edges off of his raw material. From this vision the V Series Deburring Machine was born. This machine, pictured here with Mr. Gauer, was a simple yet efficient design when compared to the modern Gauer Safty Edgers of today. Over the years Gauer Edging/Deburring Machines have developed an impeccable name throughout metal service centers in both the United States and around the world. Now installed on 6 continents, these GauerBuilt machines have given rise to the industry term “Gauer Bar” used by metal service centers throughout the world.
Gauer Still Going Strong And Ready To Serve Your Needs

In our two facilities totaling 70,000 square feet located in Kenilworth, New Jersey we at Gauer Metal provide full service custom metal fabrication including stamping, cutting, bending, welding and machining.

Dr. Deming's 14 Points for Management
W. Edwards Deming offered 14 key principles for management to follow for significantly improving the effectiveness of a business or organization. Many of the principles are philosophical. Others are more programmatic. All are transformative in nature. The points were first presented in his book Out of the Crisis. Below is the condensation of the 14 Points for Management as they appeared in the book.
1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.
4. End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
6. Institute training on the job.
7. Institute leadership (see Point 12 and Ch. 8). The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.
8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company (see Ch. 3).
9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.
10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.

Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.
Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.

11. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.
12. Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, inter alia, abolishment of the annual or merit rating and of management by objective (see Ch. 3).
13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.

Walter Shewhart - The Grandfather of Total Quality
Management.
His Ideas

The original notions of Total Quality Management and 
continuous improvement trace back to a former Bell Telephone
employee named Walter Shewhart.  One of W. Edwards Deming's
teachers, he preached the importance of adapting management
processes to create profitable situations for both businesses and
consumers, promoting the utilization of his own creation -- the
SPC control chart. 
Dr. Shewhart believed that lack of information greatly
hampered the efforts of control and management processes in a
production environment.  In order to aid a manager in making
scientific, efficient, economical decisions, he developed
Statistical Process Control methods.  Many of the modern ideas
regarding quality owe their inspirtation to Dr. Shewhart. 
He also developed the Shewhart Cycle Learning and Improvement
cycle, combining both creative management thinking with
statistical analysis.  This cycle contains four continuous steps:
Plan, Do, Study and Act.  These steps (commonly refered to as the
PDSA cycle), Shewhart believed, ultimately lead to total quality
improvement.  The cycle draws its structure from the notion that
constant evaluation of management practices -- as well as the
willingness of management to adopt and disregard unsupported
ideas --are keys to the evolution of a successful enterprise.
To find out more about some of the management tools that have
been developed from Shewhart and other quality pioneers, click on

PDSA Cycle
The PDSA Cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Act) is a systematic series of steps for gaining valuable learning and knowledge for the continual improvement of a product or process. Also known as the Deming Wheel, or Deming Cycle, the concept and application was first introduced to Dr. Deming by his mentor, Walter Shewhart of the famous Bell Laboratories in New York.
The cycle begins with the Plan step. This involves identifying a goal or purpose, formulating a theory, defining success metrics and putting a plan into action. These activities are followed by the Do step, in which the components of the plan are implemented, such as making a product. Next comes the Study step, where outcomes are monitored to test the validity of the plan for signs of progress and success, or problems and areas for improvement. The Act step closes the cycle, integrating the learning generated by the entire process, which can be used to adjust the goal, change methods or even reformulate a theory altogether. These four steps are repeated over and over as part of a never-ending cycle of continual improvement.
