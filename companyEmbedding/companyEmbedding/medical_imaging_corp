MEDD Investment Opportunity   Phone: 877-331-3444


MINIMUM 12% ANNUAL RETURN 






Business Operations


Currently own and operate 4 diagnostic imaging centers serving 4 communities and 1 radiology consulting company (teleradiology) serving 18 hospitals.
 
					Revenues $7.1 million for 2015, up from $5.4 million in 2014.

								Our business plan calls for the acquisition and operation of profitable diagnostic imaging facilities and imaging service businesses with a short term goal of annualized revenues of $18 million and EBITDA of $3 million and a long term goal of over $100 million in annualized revenues and EBITDA of $20 million*
								* Subject to raising necessary capital
							




MEDD Investment Opportunity
$6 Million of Series D Convertible Notes

3 year notes that pay 12% annual interest
Interest paid monthly by check (1% per month)
Notes are convertible into shares of MEDD at $0.15 per share
1 bonus common share of MEDD for each $1 invested in the Notes

									Use of Proceeds - Imaging Center Acquisitions
									
									References available
									Brokers protected, 7% commission/Finder's fee
							
							




Practical example

								Dr. Lucky invests $100,000 with MEDD. 
								
								At the beginning of the following month Dr. Lucky will begin receiving monthly checks at 1%/month or $1,000/month. 
								
								Within a week of the investment being closed, Dr. Lucky will receive 100,000 shares of MEDD. These shares will be restricted subject to Rule 144A. 
								
								Dr. Lucky now holds a 3 year note in MEDD. He can keep collecting interest each month and the principle due at maturity, or at Dr. Lucky's election, he can convert a part or all of the note into shares of MEDD at $0.20 per share. This would be a total of 666,667 shares of MEDD if fully converted. 
								
Minimum investment is only $25,000.







Market Realities & Opportunities

								The global diagnostic imaging market is expected to grow to $26.6 billion by 2016, with an estimated CAGR of 4.2% from 2011 to 2016. 
								
								An aging population and widening applications of diagnostic imaging services are predominantly driving the diagnostic imaging market.* 
								
Up to 50 million new customers expected to join market through Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)

								 * Source: Markets and Markets, October 2013
							





Acquisition Opportunities

								There are a large number of profitable independent imaging centers available for purchase.
								
There are over 2400 IDTFs (independent diagnostic testing facilities) in the United States alone.* 

Consolidation of a number of independent centers allow for a reduction in combined overhead costs, along with greater scale for marketing & advertising, thus improving the profitability of each center.

								* Source: American Medical Information (AMI), a division of info USA
							





Acquisition Targets


Profitable medical imaging businesses
Stable financials with consistent revenue
Absentee owner with excellent office manager/VP that remains with the MEDD team post sale
Large physician referral base
Community ties that demonstrate a strong bond for repeat business

									Once targeted, each acquisition is put through a rigorous diligence process included liability searches, audits and legal reviews
									
									Open to acquisitions in any State

To optimize patient position and minimize movement during imaging, patient positioners, immobilizers, and straps offer unique quality and value. Protecta-Coat™ multipurpose positioners provide comfortable body-molding support and an impenetrable, seamless antimicrobial coating that prevents fluid absorption. Protecta-Coat™ saves radiology departments money because it lasts for the life of the positioner and can be used over and over. For other needs, AliMed offers uncovered polyfoam positioners for reduced risks of artifacts and vinyl covered positioners that can be wiped clean.


AliStrap™ is an incredibly useful positioning strap that effectively reduces patient movement during imaging. It has strong hook-and-loop closures and can be cut to any length to fit any patient.  The edges of AliStrap™ are flexible and yielding to be skin-safe—unlike other products with stiff edges that can cause shear and patient discomfort. AliMed® also offers a single-use strap that makes cleanup easy and helps prevent cross-contamination and a heavy-duty, extra-wide immobilization strap to fit larger patients.


To meet the particular needs of diagnostic imaging, AliMed’s Imaging Surfaces accommodate narrow spaces and redistribute pressure. The types of foam available are standard polyfoam with vinyl cover, T-Foam™ (memory foam) with anti-shear, elastic cover, and closed-cell foam with seamless, easy-to-clean vinyl coating. Products are available in popular models or custom made to requested specifications.
