ABOUT LOCAL BUSINESS : PROBING MILK CONTAINER MARKET
author unknown (Nov. 1963)
file date: 2006-06-17
.




description of work:  An article published in the Spokesman-Review focusing on the work of Robert Bailey, a member of the Southside (WA) Branch of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ and later the Spokane Valley (WA) Branch.  tags:  Robert L. Bailey, Bob Bailey, Melvin M. Smith, Pres-To-Log Company 









[Includes photographs of : 1) Melvin M. Smith;  and  2) Robert L. Bailey.]. 




“Do you know that there were several billion gallons of milk consumed in the United States last year?”.




Asking the question with a happy gleam in his eye was Melvin M. Smith, president of Spokane Pres-To-Log Co.  He was hinting at the market for one of the new products developed by his company’s plastic container division.  A reusable gallon jug produced in the company plant is attracting wide interest in the dairy industry..




A Spokane dairy is now field testing the extra light plastic jugs developed by Robert L. Bailey, executive vice-president of the company and general manager of the container division.  “This has created a lot of excitement in the industry,” Bailey said.  “We’ve had dozens of long distance calls from dairies in the east and Canada inquiring about it.”. 




The company has applied for patents on both the manufacturing method and design of the bottle, he told the Chamber of Commerce Industrial Development Bureau at a meeting last week..




In pioneering this new field for plastic containers, Pres-To-Logs is carefully piling up documentary proof for community health departments in areas where the bottle will be used by dairy customers.  The jugs have already been in use more than six months in Spokane and both Smith and Bailey praised the Spokane City Health Department for helping in launching the new product and undertaking sterility tests..




“Consumer acceptance is tremendous,” Bailey said, “and in a few more months we hope to begin moving out slowly from area to area in the West.”  The company hopes to handle production for the Western states in an expanded Spokane plant and plans to license eastern manufacturers..




To give some idea of the market, Smith pointed out that in Chicago 42 percent of all milk consumed is handled in gallon-size glass jugs.  Besides weighing three pounds less than glass jugs, the Spokane product can be refilled about 50 times, a far longer life than the average glass jug..




“Of course our competitors are also excited,” Bailey said, “but mainly they’ve been working on a jug for single use only.  Our reusable jug will limit sales, but if we can gain wide acceptance, it would be a nice business for a Spokane company.”.

Company History




Robert Bailey and Alvin Barrier In The Early 1980’s



In 1971, Robert Bailey and Alvin Barrier opened a small country store called Minpro Supply in the town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina. They sold gasoline, refurbished appliances, and bologna sandwiches made by Robert’s mother.
In 1975, Mr. Carol Buckner of Asheville, North Carolina approached the two men about selling a new wood-burning stove that he had built, which included a three-speed motor. Buckner was searching for an outfit that could manufacture the stove, which he called the “Regular Buck”, as well as set up a dealer network for its sales. He had created the stove in the midst of the national energy crisis, when people were desperately looking for heating alternatives to gas and oil. Buckner made Bailey and Barrier an offer: if they could not sell the stove within 30 days, he would buy it back from them, no strings attached.



Bailey and Barrier used the stove as a floor model, and within two weeks, the partner’s had so many orders, they realized that they should pursue the future in dealing with Buck Stoves. They became the first official Buck Stove Dealer, and began assisting in manufacturing operations as well. Within two or three months, they had sold 200 stoves. They transformed their store into a manufacturing facility, selling the stoves faster than they could get them off of the finishing line. Robert’s sister, Betty Bailey Carswell, even learned how to weld to help keep production moving. They set a goal of producing 30 stoves a week, but the demand was so high they quickly fell behind.
 




Buck Stove Model 27000 The “Original” Buck Stove



Rapidly running out of physical space, the company moved down the road to a property with an existing larger structure. Bailey and Barrier set a new goal of manufacturing 200 stoves a week, but again found they still were not meeting the demand. To solve their dilemma, the two men decided to hire more employees and build a new structure on the property that could keep up with their ever-increasing sales. In less than 12 months the company went from manufacturing 30 stoves a week to 3,000 stoves per month. Shortly after, other stoves were added to the production line, including the “Big Buck” and the “Little Buck”. All three models were triple-wall stoves with three-speed motors and fans.

By the mid 1980’s, the wood stove business began to level off as the energy crisis waned. Suffering from health problems, Alvin Barrier sold his share of the company to partner Robert Bailey. Full rights and ownership to Buck Stove were transferred to Robert in May of 1984.
 
  To this day, Robert continues to lead the New Buck Corporation.  The company has grown tremendously over the decades and continues to grow today.  In 2008 Buck Stove moved into a much larger facility across town,  This 300,000 square foot, 80 acre facility not only allowed the company to expand with a more spacious work environment, warehouse and showroom.  This move also allowed the company the space for additions of newer, more sophisticated manufacturing technologies and machinery.  Machines such as state of the art laser cutting tables and an on site powder coating operation.  With the addition of this modern equipment, Buck Stove began to expand our product line to include outdoor grills and fire pits.  These products are made with modern designs and classic clean lines reflecting the same quality and craftsmanship unique to Buck Stove.  In 2011, after experiencing such great response from our customers in regards to our outdoor products, Buck Stove once again decided to expand our outdoor line to include outdoor patio furniture.  Our furniture is made from non-porous recycled plastic and is also manufactured right here in our Spruce Pine facility, providing our customers with a full line of outdoor living products combining durability, style and comfort all in one beautiful package.  Buck Stove, once again providing our customers with the same quality and craftsmanship they have come to appreciate. 
Our most recent endeavor includes  certification from the RVIA (Recreational Vehicle Industry Association).  This certification has allowed Buck Stove to launch our own line of Buck's Tiny Houses.  These tiny homes and Park Models  are also being manufactured in our Spruce Pine facility.  They range in size from 290 square feet to 400 square feet, with the first one ready for show and sale in Spring 2016. 
Currently, the company has a nationwide distribution network, including 10 national distributors that have their own dealer networks ranging from 50 to several hundred dealers!
In an ever changing industry, Buck Stove continues to be innovative in their business practices and design. 
  Unmatched American Quality is the company's main philosophy.  We continue to improve upon our products and customer service striving to be second to none.  This is our practice now and will be on into the future.  Buck Stove...truly MADE IN THE USA!!!  We take pride in the fact that, for nearly fifty years, the Buck brand has been delivered with integrity , quality hand crafted products coast to coast
