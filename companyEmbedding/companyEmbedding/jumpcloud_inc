YOU’RE SAFE WITH JUMPCLOUD
JumpCloud takes security very seriously. We understand we’re asking you to trust us, and we want to make sure you’re comfortable with our internal security practices, so that you know the data you store with us is well-protected and managed.
Agent Communication
JumpCloud manages a private PKI infrastructure to manage digital certificates for two-way TLS authentication and encryption between our servers and each agent. Each agent has its own unique private key generated at install time, which is signed by JumpCloud’s private CA, and we associate that key with our servers by storing its public key in our database.
The JumpCloud agent does not listen on any ports, and thus provides no attack surface for a remote attacker. All communications between the JumpCloud agent and the JumpCloud SaaS infrastructure are created outbound from the agent.
Assessments and Independent Audits
JumpCloud leverages a third party assessor to perform monthly vulnerability scans against its environment, and integrates those results into its development workflow based on priority.
Code audits and penetration testing by a qualified third-party assessor are executed three times per year.



            JumpCloud's commitment to security includes measures to have independent audits to evaluate the operational and security processes of our service, our employees and company at large. JumpCloud has successfully completed a Type 1 SOC 2 examination for their Directory-as-a-Service (DaaS) system. The results of this examination are available upon request to customers by emailing
            security@jumpcloud.com.


Employment
All employees undergo mandatory security awareness training as well as 7-year criminal and employment background checks prior to employment.
Recovery
JumpCloud leverages DevOps best practices to ensure that our entire environment is highly available. We leverage redundant infrastructure in disparate service providers. Particular parts of the environment vary in recovery time from a matter of seconds up to a few minutes, depending upon their size and number of dependencies.
Infrastructure Security
Access Controls
JumpCloud’s private PKI is leveraged to create and manage all our VPN keys, so all VPN and agent access can be easily revoked at any time. VPN server access is limited to key employees with a verified and documented business need, and requires both a private key and a password to be accessed.
JumpCloud’s production infrastructure is distributed across multiple public clouds. All users are access-controlled using multi-factor authentication. The production accounts use strict IAM roles and only key employees with a verified business need receive administrative access.
Data Protection
All database disk volumes utilize data-at-rest encryption, to prevent data access by unauthorized parties.
Monitoring
JumpCloud utilizes monitoring software to track all user logins and privileged commands, and to alert on any anomalies. JumpCloud (the product) is also used to ensure that all our servers remain fully patched.
Further, all log files are written to central log hosts which are monitored using OSSEC to catch any anomalous issues. This helps prevent log tampering during compromise of any edge host, as well as ensures that logged security issues do not go unnoticed.
Finally, JumpCloud uses OSSEC to alert on changes to critical configuration files and installed software.

Application Single Sign-On

  As organizations increase the number of applications within their network and through SaaS-based solutions, having the assurance your employees can use one identity to gain secure access to the applications and other resources they need is critical.  Employees gain simplicity and efficiency by having one username and password to access many of their business IT resources. Administrators improve control and security by centralizing control over the enterprise’s IT resources.

Centralized Control

  JumpCloud integrates directly with applications that support protocols such as SAML 2.0, LDAP, RADIUS, and programmatic access via REST APIs. The user account in JumpCloud acts as the central, core identity that is emitted via the appropriate protocol for authentication and authorization to the application. SaaS-based applications such as AWS, G Suite, and Salesforce can leverage SAML to enable single sign-on access with the same credentials utilized in JumpCloud. Identities stored in JumpCloud can also be authenticated through the REST-based APIs. JumpCloud provides centralized application access through a variety of different protocols.

End User Access

  JumpCloud’s application access capabilities can be leveraged through JumpCloud’s end user portal or on the application itself. For SaaS-based applications such as AWS, G Suite, and Salesforce, users simply gain access with one click from their portal. JumpCloud handles all of the authentication securely. Alternatively, users can also directly login to applications for service provider-initiated authentication. For applications leveraging LDAP, the application will automatically verify credentials with JumpCloud and enable the proper access.


  Centralization of access is critical to the on-going efficiency, health, and security of an organization.

What we look for in people at JumpCloud
We are a small team striving to dislodge the greatest monopoly in the history of IT. We find there are three core qualities in those we hire that help us succeed: the ability to learn quickly, a passion for their job, and great work ethic.

Fast Learner:
        If you haven’t seen something before, can you quickly relate it to things that you do understand and then evaluate the differences? Do you ask questions that help you better grasp concepts? When working with concepts, are you able to identify the assumptions and the structural components that underpin them? We want to see you deconstruct elements of your past work along with the cutting-edge challenges that we are facing in our business today.
      

Passionate:
        In fast growing companies, passion is what makes the difference. At larger companies, existing momentum can carry the company to continue to be successful over many future years. Not so at startups. We need to manufacture our own momentum and the only way to make that happen is to be passionate about what we are doing. Is it the career that was meant for you? If you’re truly passionate, you should be able to show us what you are doing to improve yourself and your skills.
      

Work Ethic:
        Smart work plus hard work will help us pull forward and have a chance to succeed. We want to hear about how you’ve worked smart and hard in the past. What does working hard mean to you? Hint: a lot of hours doesn’t necessarily mean working hard to us.
      
Finding the best fits for an organization is always difficult. There’s the technical skill set fit and the cultural fit. There’s the concrete and the intangibles.

What is DaaS





Authenticate
Ensure your users are who they say they are. JumpCloud authenticates your users to the devices and IT applications they need. JumpCloud supports a wide range of authentication protocols.





Authorize
Grant your users access to the resources they need, when they need it. JumpCloud ensures that the right users have the right level of access including controlling group membership and admin/root level access.





Manage
One directory to manage it all. Managing devices is a critical capability of a directory. IT admins can execute virtually any task or set of tasks on Windows, Mac, and Linux devices and your directory should not discriminate.











What does DaaS do?








Directory Services

The core of JumpCloud's Directory-as-a-Service® is the database that maps users to the applications, devices, and networks that users need.  Directory services provide a framework to securely store and provide access to your organization's most important assets. Highly scalable, always-on, and requiring no installation or on-going management, DaaS provides IT admins with an easy-to-use interface and standards-based protocols to integrate with your infrastructure.














User Management

Eliminate identity sprawl - easily import all your user accounts into one place without duplication or fuss. JumpCloud is your single source for user information, passwords, and systems users can access in your organization.














Device Management

An organization's addition of Mac and Linux systems decreases IT control. JumpCloud's system management capabilities enable IT admins to regain the control they need. Now, Mac, Linux, and Windows systems can be centrally controlled through policies.














REST API User Management

Part of creating an application is building the user management infrastructure. Whether the application is internal only or a public-facing application, creating, terminating, and updating user access is a fundamental requirement. Developers often spend valuable time writing code and managing this piece of an application. JumpCloud’s Directory-as-a-Service is a REST-based directory service for application developers. Simply embed the API calls to provision, deprovision, and authenticate users. Developers don’t need to worry about managing the user directory store or ensuring that it is always available. JumpCloud’s SaaS-based directory service does the heavy lifting.














Group Management

Directory-as-a-Service groups allows you to authorize your users to access the systems, devices, and applications they need. A simple to use interface helps associate users with the resources they need to access within these groups.















Application Single Sign-On

Provide your users access to the applications they need most through one centralized identity. Directory-as-a-Service provides end-user authentication and authorization to access your company’s critical applications. With its support for SAML 2.0, LDAP, and RESTful APIs, DaaS supports access to leading SaaS vendors and your company’s internal applications.














G Suite Integration

By itself, G Suite does not function as an organization’s directory service and doesn't provide device, application, or network authentication. Organizations utilizing G Suite are moving their infrastructure to the cloud and don’t want to leverage an on-premises directory such as Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP. JumpCloud Directory-as-a-Service platform offers a tightly integrated cloud-based directory for organizations using G Suite, extending G Suite identities to devices, applications, and networks whether on-premises or in the cloud. JumpCloud adds one of the most significant missing components for G Suite organizations – cloud-based directory services.














Cloud RADIUS Service

Locking down your WiFi network is a snap with JumpCloud’s Cloud RADIUS Service. No longer do IT admins need to spin up their own RADIUS server, hook it up to their wireless infrastructure, and then go user by user to setup deeper network control. With JumpCloud’s RADIUS-as-a-Service, IT admins simply point their WiFi network to JumpCloud and enable users via the JumpCloud web console. JumpCloud steps up your WiFi security game without any of the heavy lifting.














Password Complexity Management

Weak passwords are the quickest way to get compromised. Ensure that your users have strong, complex passwords with JumpCloud’s Password Complexity Builder functionality. IT admins can specify length, special characters, password reuse, and grace periods with JumpCloud’s Password Complexity capabilities. Password complexity and reuse is enforced on all devices, applications, and networks connected to JumpCloud. IT admins can rest easier knowing that their users cannot use passwords that can be easily cracked.














LDAP-as-a-Service

IT admins know how painful it is to implement LDAP. Besides just setting up and configuring LDAP, IT admins have the on-going maintenance of the service and figuring out how to connect all of a company's employees' devices, applications, and networks to it. That’s a lot of work. JumpCloud’s LDAP-as-a-Service gives IT organizations all of the benefits of LDAP (and more) without the heavy lifting. JumpCloud runs the LDAP servers, maintains everything, and has created standard mechanisms to connect IT resources to LDAP, allowing you to leverage LDAP without the work.














Event Logging API

The ability to review the activities of users who have accessed and performed operations against resources within your internal network has become an absolute requirement for organizations of any size. As your core directory, JumpCloud sits at the center of many of your employee interactions with resources. That means it’s equipped to provide answers to critical questions in the event of a security need.The Events API provides JumpCloud administrators the ability to query event data on demand or via scheduled jobs. This makes it efficient to procure and analyze the data which logs the events your employees perform against your infrastructure e.g., changes to JumpCloud accounts, such as additions, deletions, modifications to objects, or execution of operations under the control of JumpCloud. JumpCloud’s Events API outputs readable JSON, a common standard for structuring data and is perfect for integrating with larger auditing needs.














Microsoft Office 365 Integration

Microsoft Office 365 is one of the fastest growing cloud applications in the corporate environment. Microsoft is pushing organizations to shift to the cloud and Office 365 is the core of that strategy. While organizations are jumping on to Office 365, they are struggling with the choice of directory services. The on­premises Active Directory solution is no longer as attractive now that the email and productivity suite has made the shift to the cloud. Further, with other cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Compute Engine, RackSpace, etc.), heterogeneous systems (Windows, Mac and Linux), LDAP and SAML ­based applications, and other critical Identity­-as-­a­-Service needs required by corporations, the need for a vendor­ independent identity provider has become imperative. JumpCloud’s Directory-­as-­a­-Service® is tightly integrated with Office 365 to centrally manage identities, provision, and de­provision user access across all of these resources and more.














Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Identity theft is everybody’s problem. It is the #1 conduit to your network being compromised. Whether it is brute force login attacks or your user’s identity being compromised elsewhere on the Internet, your network is constantly at risk of a breach. The best way to solve for that is by adding a second factor for authentication. Along with something that the user knows (their password), ask for something that they have – a multifactor authentication token. JumpCloud’s Directory-as-a-Service® tightly integrates MFA into the platform and at the device level. With MFA enabled, your users will need to provide their MFA token at login – whether that is on our user portal or on their device.












the SaaS in DaaS




Always Simple

Always Simple
Our mission is to take the complexity that's plagued directories away. Forever. Installation nightmares, management chores, unusable interfaces - everything that SaaS isn't. Everything a modern directory shouldn't be. No installation, simple to use interfaces and the ability to do more against more infrastructure. That is DaaS.




Always On

Always On
As a managed service, DaaS is always on. Leave the uptime and availability chores to JumpCloud and our infrastructure engineers who have designed integrity, performance, uptime and failover into the system from Day One. Our business is to ensure your employees have the access to the resources they need, when they need it. Always.






Always Scalable

Always Scalable
DaaS is elastic. It isn't waiting for you to take action when your directory requires more space, it automatically provisions what it needs on our robust cloud-based platform.




Always Secure

Always Secure
Security is difficult and expensive, but JumpCloud's team has decades of network security experience. We secure your data, so you can breathe easy knowing that your user information is safe and protected.
