 Career History



Fund Advisor

                                    2013 - ?                


Coastland Capital LLC


                  Coastland Capital generally seeks to generate positive risk adjusted returns and preserve capital with low correlation to major asset classes such as equities and fixed income. The firm constructs diversified multi-strategy portfolios designed to extract high current yields, capital gains and undervalued optionality. Coastland Capital currently focuses on relative value trades intended to take advantage of mispricing across a company’s capital structure (senior debt, subordinated debt and preferred and common stock). The firm invests primarily in investment-grade and non-investment-grade debt securities, equities, and other assets, as well as equity and interest rate derivatives and certain commodity futures. Typically, there are no limits on the types of investment instruments Overland may utilize, and there are no formal diversification constraints.
