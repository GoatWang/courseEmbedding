Erickson Incorporated is an American aircraft manufacturing and operating company based in Portland, Oregon, United States.[1] Founded in 1971, it is known for producing the S-64 Aircrane helicopter, which is used in fire suppression and other heavy-lift operations. The company was known as Erickson Air-Crane Incorporated until 2014. Erickson's main facility is located in the Southern Oregon community of Central Point.

History[edit]
Erickson was established in 1971 in Central Point by Jack Erickson.[2] Originally the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 were purchased from Sikorsky Aircraft by Erickson Air-Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a 2,650-gallon (~10,000 liter) fixed retardant tank to assist in the control of bushfires.[citation needed] The Skycrane has a support group of a tanker truck, service trailer and lift, and a crew of 8 people.[3]
In 2007, Erickson was sold to ZM Private Equity Fund, who in 2009 moved the company's headquarters to Portland.[2] Then a privately held company, Erickson announced plans to go public in 2010,[4][5] which was delayed into 2012.[6] On April 11, 2012, the company completed an initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ market, with ZM Private Equity Fund retaining ownership of 63% of the company.[2][7] The company acquired Evergreen International Aviation's helicopter unit for a $250 million deal in March 2013.[8] Erickson then bought Brazil-based HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S.A.'s oil and gas unit, with the deal expected to be finalized in 2013.[9][10]
The name of the company was changed to Erickson Inc. in February 2014.[11]
Aviation industry veteran Andy Mills was named CEO of Erickson following the company's emergence from bankruptcy, replacing Jeff Roberts.[12]
The Evergreen purchase was financed partly with debt, and (together with challenging business conditions) caused Erickson to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016 to reorganize while keeping the business running.[13] During bankruptcy the company returned to private ownership and emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2017.[14]
Markets[edit]
Wes Lematta of Columbia Helicopters and Jack Erickson were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging in 1971 using Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y and timber provided by the Erickson Lumber Company. The following year the Boeing Vertol 107 was used. Since Lemmata provided the helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful "Heli-Loggers".
S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the Italian State Forestry Corps, and Korea Forest Service for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, municipalities and Federal Agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and timber harvesting. The aerial services portion of company accounts for 92% of revenues.[15]
Heliport[edit]
The company owns Erickson Air-Crane Admin Offices Heliport (FAA LID: OG58), a private, 130 x 130 ft. (40 x 40 m) heliport.

For more than 40 years, Erickson Incorporated has developed a unique set of capabilities and skills to support, sustain, and improve legacy aircraft and operational performance. Our MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) organization provides legacy operators around the world with maintenance, supply chain and engineering solutions to keep them flying safely and reliably.
Legacy Platform
With more than 220 skilled mechanics and technicians cross-trained to work on various products and platforms, Erickson’s MRO organization is both FAA and EASA certified, with a quality system compliant and approved to ASQR, QPS and AS9100 standards. Our Part 145 repair station offers a full and integrated array of services on a range of legacy platforms.
Erickson has mastered the art of finding solutions to manufacture legacy helicopter parts and sustain supply chain reliability. Getting the right part, on time and for the right price is why we are the world’s leader in medium to heavy-lift legacy helicopter support. As an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and partner for leading helicopter OEMs, we offer fully-integrated maintenance, manufacturing and engineering capabilities and a broad portfolio of turnkey services. From small component repairs to extensive heavy base maintenance, from engines and main gearboxes to avionics and re-wiring, Erickson can do it all.
We are proud of our close relationships with aircraft OEM leaders such as Sikorsky, Bell Helicopter and Airbus Helicopters, as well as engine manufacturers such as Turbomeca and Pratt & Whitney Canada. As a world-renowned OEM, we understand safety, reliability and cost pressures and the importance of efficient and expedient service delivery. We are here to help develop solutions for all platforms the legacy phase of their life cycle.
The solutions we have garnered in legacy aircraft support combined with the strong relationship with Bell Helicopter resulted in a milestone for our company in 2015.
In 2015 Erickson Incorporated assumed product support responsibility of the Bell 214 B and ST models, including spare parts supply, technical assistance, maintenance training, and maintenance, repair and overhaul services. This agreement will extend the life of the Bell 214 aircraft and supports a licensing agreement for Erickson to make, buy and distribute Bell 214 part numbers.
While 2015 showed the inception of a new program for legacy support in the Bell 214, it also resulted in our decades long Sikorsky relationship further developing into the CH-53E platform. Erickson was awarded two CH-53E refurbishment contracts through the US Governments R23G contract vehicle in a partnership with Adams Communications.

About
Corporate Profile

Clients bring us unique problems. We deliver solutions just about anywhere.
When customers need us, we fly straight to where conventional wisdom flees, and bring solutions knowing that every mission needs to be uniquely customized.   Every day, all over the globe, one of our many aircraft from our diverse fleet is performing faster, better, cheaper, or greener than other options.
Our clients like to say we’ve “got their back” when they call in a problem: wildfires, national security, oil and gas exploration, timber harvesting, energy powerline installation, habitat preservation, MEDEVAC needs, design engineering or aircraft maintenance. We’re driven by cutting-edge engineering, elbow grease and optimism, and are continually obsessed with precision and safety.
Our crews can be found most everywhere and anywhere: emerging economies, rocky slopes, tangled jungles, frozen outposts and over relentless seas.
Yes, we fly a myriad of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft really, really well, but we do so to build community infrastructure, preserve lives and property, support our soldiers, and ultimately do our part to make the world a better place. Together, with our partners and clients, the sky’s the limit.
Erickson. Tested and Trusted.

History[edit]
Erickson was established in 1971 in Central Point by Jack Erickson.[2] Originally the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 were purchased from Sikorsky Aircraft by Erickson Air-Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a 2,650-gallon (~10,000 liter) fixed retardant tank to assist in the control of bushfires.[citation needed] The Skycrane has a support group of a tanker truck, service trailer and lift, and a crew of 8 people.[3]
In 2007, Erickson was sold to ZM Private Equity Fund, who in 2009 moved the company's headquarters to Portland.[2] Then a privately held company, Erickson announced plans to go public in 2010,[4][5] which was delayed into 2012.[6] On April 11, 2012, the company completed an initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ market, with ZM Private Equity Fund retaining ownership of 63% of the company.[2][7] The company acquired Evergreen International Aviation's helicopter unit for a $250 million deal in March 2013.[8] Erickson then bought Brazil-based HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S.A.'s oil and gas unit, with the deal expected to be finalized in 2013.[9][10]
The name of the company was changed to Erickson Inc. in February 2014.[11]
Aviation industry veteran Andy Mills was named CEO of Erickson following the company's emergence from bankruptcy, replacing Jeff Roberts.[12]
The Evergreen purchase was financed partly with debt, and (together with challenging business conditions) caused Erickson to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016 to reorganize while keeping the business running.[13] During bankruptcy the company returned to private ownership and emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2017.[14]
Markets[edit]
Wes Lematta of Columbia Helicopters and Jack Erickson were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging in 1971 using Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y and timber provided by the Erickson Lumber Company. The following year the Boeing Vertol 107 was used. Since Lemmata provided the helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful "Heli-Loggers".
S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the Italian State Forestry Corps, and Korea Forest Service for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, municipalities and Federal Agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and timber harvesting. The aerial services portion of company accounts for 92% of revenues.[15]
Heliport[edit]
The company owns Erickson Air-Crane Admin Offices Heliport (FAA LID: OG58), a private, 130 x 130 ft. (40 x 40 m) heliport.

History[edit]
Erickson was established in 1971 in Central Point by Jack Erickson.[2] Originally the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 were purchased from Sikorsky Aircraft by Erickson Air-Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a 2,650-gallon (~10,000 liter) fixed retardant tank to assist in the control of bushfires.[citation needed] The Skycrane has a support group of a tanker truck, service trailer and lift, and a crew of 8 people.[3]
In 2007, Erickson was sold to ZM Private Equity Fund, who in 2009 moved the company's headquarters to Portland.[2] Then a privately held company, Erickson announced plans to go public in 2010,[4][5] which was delayed into 2012.[6] On April 11, 2012, the company completed an initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ market, with ZM Private Equity Fund retaining ownership of 63% of the company.[2][7] The company acquired Evergreen International Aviation's helicopter unit for a $250 million deal in March 2013.[8] Erickson then bought Brazil-based HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S.A.'s oil and gas unit, with the deal expected to be finalized in 2013.[9][10]
The name of the company was changed to Erickson Inc. in February 2014.[11]
Aviation industry veteran Andy Mills was named CEO of Erickson following the company's emergence from bankruptcy, replacing Jeff Roberts.[12]
The Evergreen purchase was financed partly with debt, and (together with challenging business conditions) caused Erickson to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016 to reorganize while keeping the business running.[13] During bankruptcy the company returned to private ownership and emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2017.[14]
Markets[edit]
Wes Lematta of Columbia Helicopters and Jack Erickson were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging in 1971 using Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y and timber provided by the Erickson Lumber Company. The following year the Boeing Vertol 107 was used. Since Lemmata provided the helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful "Heli-Loggers".
S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the Italian State Forestry Corps, and Korea Forest Service for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, municipalities and Federal Agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and timber harvesting. The aerial services portion of company accounts for 92% of revenues.[15]
Heliport[edit]
The company owns Erickson Air-Crane Admin Offices Heliport (FAA LID: OG58), a private, 130 x 130 ft. (40 x 40 m) heliport.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Erickson was established in 1971 in Central Point by Jack Erickson.[2] Originally the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, the type certification and manufacturing rights for the S-64 were purchased from Sikorsky Aircraft by Erickson Air-Crane in 1992. Since that time, Erickson Air-Crane has become the manufacturer and world's largest operator of S-64 Aircranes and has made over 1,350 changes to the airframe, instrumentation, and payload capabilities of the helicopter. The Aircrane can be fitted with a 2,650-gallon (~10,000 liter) fixed retardant tank to assist in the control of bushfires.[citation needed] The Skycrane has a support group of a tanker truck, service trailer and lift, and a crew of 8 people.[3]
In 2007, Erickson was sold to ZM Private Equity Fund, who in 2009 moved the company's headquarters to Portland.[2] Then a privately held company, Erickson announced plans to go public in 2010,[4][5] which was delayed into 2012.[6] On April 11, 2012, the company completed an initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ market, with ZM Private Equity Fund retaining ownership of 63% of the company.[2][7] The company acquired Evergreen International Aviation's helicopter unit for a $250 million deal in March 2013.[8] Erickson then bought Brazil-based HRT Participacoes em Petroleo S.A.'s oil and gas unit, with the deal expected to be finalized in 2013.[9][10]
The name of the company was changed to Erickson Inc. in February 2014.[11]
Aviation industry veteran Andy Mills was named CEO of Erickson following the company's emergence from bankruptcy, replacing Jeff Roberts.[12]
The Evergreen purchase was financed partly with debt, and (together with challenging business conditions) caused Erickson to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2016 to reorganize while keeping the business running.[13] During bankruptcy the company returned to private ownership and emerged from bankruptcy protection in May 2017.[14]
Markets[edit]
Wes Lematta of Columbia Helicopters and Jack Erickson were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging in 1971 using Lematta's Sikorsky S-61, registration number N318Y and timber provided by the Erickson Lumber Company. The following year the Boeing Vertol 107 was used. Since Lemmata provided the helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful "Heli-Loggers".
S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the Italian State Forestry Corps, and Korea Forest Service for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, municipalities and Federal Agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and timber harvesting. The aerial services portion of company accounts for 92% of revenues.[15]
Heliport[edit]
The company owns Erickson Air-Crane Admin Offices Heliport (FAA LID: OG58), a private, 130 x 130 ft. (40 x 40 m) heliport.
