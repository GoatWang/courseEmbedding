PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – May 24, 2017) – Gatewood Capital Partners (“Gatewood”), a New York based private equity firm, announced today the successful closing of its first fund, Gatewood Capital Opportunity Fund L.P., with more than $220 million in capital commitments, significantly exceeding its $150 million target. Gatewood Capital Partners seeks to make strategic seed and sponsorship investments in highly qualified emerging managers by providing significant anchor capital. Gatewood expects to launch and invest in more than eight funds over the next three years, with capital sourced from a combination of its discretionary fund and limited partners’ co-investments.
“We greatly appreciate the support of our investors whose commitment underscores the value proposition of Gatewood’s investment strategy and the depth of our team,” said Managing Partner Oren Monhite Yahav. “Our investor base includes a broad mix of domestic and international institutional investors, including a number of foundations, family offices, public pension plans, asset managers, insurance companies, and high net worth investors.” Mr. Monhite Yahav added, “We look forward to further developing our limited partner relationships and expect to make $500 to $700 million in capital commitments over the next three years from our fund and co-investors.” 





“Gatewood’s approach goes beyond that of traditional fund investors. Over the past decade, our principals have built a ‘partnership culture’ based on strong alignment of interests, a high level of transparency, and a value-add approach to strategic seed investing in private equity and private debt managers,” said Managing Partner Amir Aviv. “Our differentiated strategy is largely focused on supporting new managers in launching their funds. We do this by providing them with $50 to $100 million of ‘first close’ LP capital and ongoing marketing support. We strive to maintain discipline and a culture of fiduciary responsibility with all of our underlying managers, while at the same time seeking strong risk-adjusted returns.”
K&L Gates served as legal advisor to Gatewood Capital Partners. A placement agent was not used.
