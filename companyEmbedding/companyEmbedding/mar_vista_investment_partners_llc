Our bottom-up approach is unique to other growth managers in that we place as much emphasis on valuation and protection of capital as we do on the growth potential of a company.






Philosophy



Mar Vista invests in high quality growth businesses trading at discounts to fair value. Specifically, we look for companies with sustainable competitive advantages and abundant opportunities to grow and reinvest capital at high rates of return. We also seek management teams with a proven ability to allocate capital in ways that maximize shareholder value.

Our bottom-up approach is unique to other growth managers in that we place as much emphasis on valuation and protection of capital as we do on the growth potential of a company. We prefer businesses that can grow profits at high rates, but will not invest if the stock price already reflects these opportunities.


We value companies as private entities, discounting free cash flows, or economic value added, to determine what the business is worth. We then compare this number to the price the market is currently willing to pay. Our required margin of safety, or discount to fair value, varies depending on the stability and predictability of the business. The wider the range of potential outcomes, the higher the margin of safety we demand.

We sell an investment when the market price exceeds our estimate of fair value, the fundamentals fall short of our investment thesis, or when there are more attractive investment alternatives.

In our view, Mar Vista’s longer term investment horizon (3-5 years or more) creates a significant competitive advantage. Our willingness to look beyond the next several quarters to assess the true cash flow potential of a business creates numerous lower-risk investment opportunities. Often, what is perceived to be the maximum point of uncertainty is, in reality, the best entry point since the market has already priced in an overly pessimistic scenario.

Portfolio Strategies




Strategic Growth - Mar Vista’s Strategic Growth strategy seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of 30-50 durable franchises that can grow excess returns on capital well into the future yet trade at attractive margins of safety. Position sizes range from 1% to 5% at cost. We believe the diversification found in a portfolio of 30-50 stocks provides ample opportunity for differentiated outcomes, while dampening the volatility inherent in more concentrated products. To learn more about Mar Vista's Strategic Growth strategy, click here to view the latest quarterly profile.
Focus - Mar Vista’s Focus strategy seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in a concentrated portfolio of 15-20 durable franchises. Following a bottom-up process, we look for companies exhibiting above-average intrinsic value growth, strong financial strength, dominant business models, pricing power, significant free cash flows, and the ability to prosper in a variety of market environments. Position sizes average 5%, though that weighting can vary depending on a stock’s risk/reward characteristics. For clients with a longer time horizon and greater tolerance for volatility, we believe Focus has the potential to provide superior risk-adjusted returns relative to more diversified strategies over a full market cycle. To learn more about Mar Vista's Focus strategy, click here to view the latest quarterly profile.
Global - Mar Vista’s Global strategy seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of 15-30 businesses. Applying the same investment philosophy and process as our domestic strategies, we invest in global companies that possess attractive per share intrinsic value growth, durable competitive advantages, pricing power, copious amounts of free cash flow, opportunities to reinvest excess capital in high return on capital projects, and the ability to prosper in a variety of market environments. Position sizes range from 3% to 8% at cost and approximately 40% to 50% of the companies in the portfolio are domiciled outside of the United States.
