PENDLETON — The South Madison Community Schools Board of Trustees on Thursday interviewed in an open forum a police officer, a former educator who now is in the software business, and a retired educator who now is a real estate agent to fill a vacant seat.Mark Brizendine, Christopher Cochran and Michael Hanna are among six applicants hoping to fill the board seat left vacant earlier this month by the resignation of Terry Auker. Former South Madison board members DeAnn Wehner and Joseph Downing and former South Madison administrator Jeanne Fredericks were interviewed on Monday.Each of the six sitting board members was assigned to ask the candidates the same question. Each candidate was given 30 minutes, but most completed their interviews within 15 to 20 minutes.
Brizendine, a 31-year Anderson Police Department veteran who oversees its community policing program, stressed the work he has done with children as a sex crimes investigator and through the DARE, anti-drug program. Because of his experiences, Brizendine said, he has a passion for counselors and programs that deal with at-risk youth.“I can be objective when I come on this board. I don’t have an agenda,” said Brizendine, who has two children are Pendleton Heights High School graduates.Cochran, a software delivery manager who used to be a teacher and football coach, said one of his concerns is school choice and the ability of the school district to attract rather than lose students.
“Our role is to make sure the product that leaves the school system is the best product we can produce,” said the father of two graduates and two current high school students.Hanna, who retired as a school administrator in 2006, said he is interested in finding ways to encourage more students to become school teachers. He said low pay, excessive paperwork and strict stipulations discourage young people from entering education as a career.






“I think that would be a challenge, to entice students to become teachers,” he said.Decision likely July 6The South Madison Community Schools Board of Trustees is expected to select a board member to replace Terry Auker at its regular meeting at 7 p.m. July 6 at the South Madison administration center, 203 S. Heritage Way, Pendleton.
