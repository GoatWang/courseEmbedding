Framing Info







British photographer, Terry O’Neill, has photographed presidents, prime ministers, rock stars, Oscar winners and the British Royal Family. He chronicled the lives of emerging rock stars and icons of the 60s, including David Bowie, Elton John, The Who, Eric Clapton and Chuck Berry. He photographed The Beatles and The Rolling Stones when they were struggling young bands, and worked closely with Frank Sinatra for over 30 years. His photograph of Faye Dunaway, in Beverly Hills, the morning after she won her Best Actress Oscar for Network, has been nominated as the most iconic Hollywood shot of all time. O’Neill has produced covers for Time, Newsweek, Stern, Paris Match, The Sunday Times Magazine and Vanity Fair, and his work is featured in national galleries and private collections worldwide.
Read full bio
 





As one of his first assignments for ‘The Daily Sketch,’ Terry was sent to photograph a new, upcoming band…The Beatles! This shot was the first public picture of the Beatles, and was the first time a pop group appeared on the front page of a British national newspaper. “To open up a newspaper and see a band was unheard of,” but the newspaper went on to sell out.

Chelsea formally release John Terry and academy-product-turned-serial-loanee Alex Davey   The Pride of London  LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 21: John Terry of Chelsea applauds during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Sunderland at Stamford Bridge on May 21, 2017 in London, England. (Photo by Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images)Chelsea make contact with Leonardo Bonucci representatives by Ajitesh RasgotraParis Saint-Germain’s expanded transfer budget will not help Chelsea off-load Diego Costa by George PerryChelsea FC NewsChelsea formally release John Terry and academy-product-turned-serial-loanee Alex Daveyby George Perry1 month agoTweetSharexGPlusPinCommentJohn Terry appeared on Chelsea’s official list of released players today, alongside Alex Davey. This is likely the first and last time you’ll see those names in the same sentence.Premier League clubs submitted their list of players who are not renewing contracts and are formally released from their clubs. Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United released the fewest players of any clubs in the league. The Blues released two – John Terry and Alex Davey – while their rivals released one each.Chelsea and Manchester United had two of most prominent names among the newly-confirmed free agents. United released Zlatan Ibrahimovic upon the completion of his one-year contract. Ibrahimovic’s unattached status will send Major League Soccer and Chinese Super League clubs scrambling. Both twilight destinations will figure out how much they can afford to play (MLS), or how much they will be allowed to pay (CSL), for the Swedish star.More from The Pride of LondonAntonio Candreva rubbishes Chelsea rumours as wingback search continues8h agoChelsea captaincy given to Gary Cahill but with no guarantee of playing time13h agoChelsea boss Antonio Conte hoping for a new arrival in Singapore14h agoChelsea have even fewer reasons than before to pursue Fernando Llorente16h agoJeremie Boga raised his profile at Chelsea in strong outing against Arsenal17h agoIbrahimovic’s release also sends the transfer market for a striker into high gear. Chelsea and United are now fully engaged in the battle for Romelu Lukaku, Alvaro Morata and Andrea Belotti.Reports earlier today said that United and Morata were on the verge of an agreement. With Ibrahimovic out of the way, Morata would have little to no competition for the starting job at United. Lukaku’s unpleasant history with Jose Mourinho and the recent rumours that his return was nearly complete may have impelled United to close the deal with Morata as early as possible.Manchester City released the most players – eight – of any top-six team. Pep Guardiola cleaned out the disastrous Willy Caballero, along with veterans Jesus Navas, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy. Guardiola’s ever-shifting lineup throughout the 2016/17 season gave little clear indication of City’s direction in the transfer market, other than the desperate need for a goalkeeper. The list of players leaving the Etihad does not point in any new directions for their summer activity or Guardiola’s plans for next season.Chelsea’s other released player – Alex Davey – spent his entire senior career to date with little prospect of reaching the first team. He joined the Blues as a U11, and had a mixed career in the Academy. He won an FA Youth Cup and U21 Premier League title in 2011/12 and 2013/14, respectively. Injuries plagued him in the latter stages, and centre-backs like Andreas Christensen and Nathan Ake exposed a yawning gap in quality.Next: Chelsea make contact with Leonardo Bonucci representativesDavey played on loan at Scunthorpe, Peterborough, Stabaek (Norway) and Crawley Town. He made 18 appearances for Crawley Town this season, his most in senior football. As of this writing, both Chelsea and Crawley Town had removed him from their player pages.

Schoeps CMXY 4V Microphone | Hire Catalogue - Terry Tew Sound & Light Hire London

























































 










 






 

Tel: 020 8502 2943   Email: sales@terrytew.co.uk 




 



















« Back to Catalogue   <  >Schoeps CMXY 4V MicrophonefacebooktwitterProduct Details Additional Information  Contact UsThe Schoeps CMXY 4V Stereo Microphone is elegant and unobtrusive. Its mild, high-frequency boost increases the intelligibility of speech and compensates for high-frequency losses typical of moderate recording distances. Thus, it is suitable for music recordings, TV and broadcast use, e.g., on a table for discussions, for presenters, boom operations, or as a stereo spot microphone on a stand.
The capsules are arranged side-by-side and the distance between center points of the capsules is only 0.8″ (21.0 mm). While this distance is in the horizontal plane, it is considerably less than the vertical distance between capsules in most other stereo microphones of professional quality. Thus, the precision of stereo imaging and mono compatibility are fully in keeping with established professional requirements. The overall width of the 2 microphones combined is similar to the diameter of a conventional stereo microphone’s capsule assembly. This is possible by using the CCM Compact Condenser Microphones, which are the smallest non-electret condenser microphones with balances outputs.
Unlike conventional microphones which have one fixed and one rotatable capsule, the angle between the capsules of the CMXY 4V Microphone (and hence the recording angle, which is the range within which the sound sources should be placed) can be adjusted without affecting the main stereo axis. The capsules always rotate equally and in opposite directions by means of a gear arrangement in the base of the microphone. This greatly simplifies setting up the microphone.
The CMXY 4V Stereo Microphone has balanced outputs at an impedance of only 90Ω. This allows cable lengths of up to several hundred meters to be used without loss of sound quality, thereby reducing the risk of electromagnetic interference. This Ig version has a miniature output connector and includes the KS 5 IU adapter cable which terminates in an XLR-5M connector.

Two cardioid mics with lateral pickup
Compact, elegant, and lightweight
Universally applicable
Angle between the microphones is adjustable
Miniature output connector and included adapter cable with XLR 5M connector

About the Collection
  Take a revolutionary approach to anti-aging with Consult Beaute - an internal, external system from renowned plastic surgeon and E! Television personality, Dr. Terry Dubrow. While most anti-aging products only offer topical creams, Consult Beaute goes one step further with an innovative combination of time-fighting topical products and ingestible supplements to help support healthy skin, hair and nails. Give your body what it needs to look and feel fabulous.
About the Guests
  Dr. Terry Dubrow is a renowned plastic surgeon known best for his work on E! Television's "Botched" and other reality television programs. He is also an accomplished author, publishing over 30 papers in peer-reviewed surgical journals and co-authoring the book "The Acne Cure."
Heather Dubrow, a prominent television personality and wife of Dr. Terry Dubrow, plays a key role in the development of Consult Beaute. She tests each product herself and provides recommendations on how to make them even better. Having tried all of the formulas, Heather loves being able to present the line from a woman’s point of view.

Development[edit]
Main article: Terry's
The company opened the Art Deco-style factory The Chocolate Works in 1926, and began launching new products.[1] These included the Dessert Chocolate Apple (1926), Terry's All Gold (1931) and the Chocolate Orange (1932). [2] At the onset of World War II, confectionery production was immediately halted. The factory was taken over by F. Hills and Sons of Manchester as a shadow factory to manufacture and repair aircraft propeller blades. With the factory handed back to the company post-war, production was difficult due to continued rationing in the United Kingdom, and limited imports of raw cocoa. In 1954, production of the chocolate apple was phased out in favour of increased production of the chocolate orange.[1]
In the North American market, where it has had a variety of importers over the years, it was briefly sold as a Tobler (maker of the Toblerone) product.
Chocolate oranges appeared on the South Korean market in the GS25 chain of convenience stores in 2017.




Korean packaging


Since 2005 and the closure of the Terry factory in York, Chocolate Orange products have been manufactured near Jankowice, Poland.[3]
In 1979, Terry's launched the Chocolate Lemon, but it was withdrawn three years later.[2]
Structure[edit]




Terry's Chocolate Orange Bar, a chocolate bar version of the Chocolate Orange


The Terry's Chocolate Orange comprises an orange-shaped ball of chocolate mixed with orange oil, divided into 20 segments, similar to a real orange, and wrapped in orange-skin patterned foil. When packaged, the segments are stuck together firmly in the centre; therefore, prior to unwrapping, the ball is traditionally tapped severely on a hard surface to cause the segments to separate from each other (dubbed "Tap and Unwrap" or "Whack and Unwrap").
Spin-offs[edit]
There have been a number of spin-off products, currently including:

Chocolate Orange bar: a bar of six segments, initially produced with smooth vertical segments (similar to a Toblerone bar), then, later, with textured segments that mimic the traditional orange shape.
Chocolate Orange minis: a bag of small segments
Chocolate Orange White Eggs: egg-shaped white-chocolate versions of Chocolate Orange that were available for one Easter
Segsations: individual segments of chocolate in different flavours, including: milk chocolate, puffed rice, honeycomb, cornflake, white chocolate and a "double seg" of layered milk and dark chocolate, all flavoured with orange oil.
Segsations Mini Eggs: individual foil-wrapped eggs of chocolate in same flavours as Segsations, for Easter
Chocolate Orange – Egg & Spoon: a milk chocolate egg filled with an orange fondant filling (similar to Cadbury's Creme Egg)

Advertising[edit]
The Chocolate Orange product is known for its unusual marketing, which is usually at its heaviest around Christmas. At one time it was estimated that the Chocolate Orange was found in a tenth of British Christmas stockings.[4] Actress Dawn French has fronted numerous campaigns for the brand, often in a posed scene of defending and hiding "her" Chocolate Orange from others. Famous marketing phrases include:

Tap it and unwrap it (since replaced with "whack and unwrap")
It's not Terry's, it's mine
Don't tap it... Whack it!

More recent advertisements (after the rebranding) do not feature French and contain the new slogan "Round but not round for long" (some include the Countdown theme tune). The newest advertising campaign in the United Kingdom features various situations in which people are trying to break the segments of their Terry's Chocolate Orange apart with the slogan "Smash it to pieces, love it to bits".

Development[edit]
Main article: Terry's
The company opened the Art Deco-style factory The Chocolate Works in 1926, and began launching new products.[1] These included the Dessert Chocolate Apple (1926), Terry's All Gold (1931) and the Chocolate Orange (1932). [2] At the onset of World War II, confectionery production was immediately halted. The factory was taken over by F. Hills and Sons of Manchester as a shadow factory to manufacture and repair aircraft propeller blades. With the factory handed back to the company post-war, production was difficult due to continued rationing in the United Kingdom, and limited imports of raw cocoa. In 1954, production of the chocolate apple was phased out in favour of increased production of the chocolate orange.[1]
In the North American market, where it has had a variety of importers over the years, it was briefly sold as a Tobler (maker of the Toblerone) product.
Chocolate oranges appeared on the South Korean market in the GS25 chain of convenience stores in 2017.




Korean packaging


Since 2005 and the closure of the Terry factory in York, Chocolate Orange products have been manufactured near Jankowice, Poland.[3]
In 1979, Terry's launched the Chocolate Lemon, but it was withdrawn three years later.[2]
Structure[edit]




Terry's Chocolate Orange Bar, a chocolate bar version of the Chocolate Orange


The Terry's Chocolate Orange comprises an orange-shaped ball of chocolate mixed with orange oil, divided into 20 segments, similar to a real orange, and wrapped in orange-skin patterned foil. When packaged, the segments are stuck together firmly in the centre; therefore, prior to unwrapping, the ball is traditionally tapped severely on a hard surface to cause the segments to separate from each other (dubbed "Tap and Unwrap" or "Whack and Unwrap").
Spin-offs[edit]
There have been a number of spin-off products, currently including:

Chocolate Orange bar: a bar of six segments, initially produced with smooth vertical segments (similar to a Toblerone bar), then, later, with textured segments that mimic the traditional orange shape.
Chocolate Orange minis: a bag of small segments
Chocolate Orange White Eggs: egg-shaped white-chocolate versions of Chocolate Orange that were available for one Easter
Segsations: individual segments of chocolate in different flavours, including: milk chocolate, puffed rice, honeycomb, cornflake, white chocolate and a "double seg" of layered milk and dark chocolate, all flavoured with orange oil.
Segsations Mini Eggs: individual foil-wrapped eggs of chocolate in same flavours as Segsations, for Easter
Chocolate Orange – Egg & Spoon: a milk chocolate egg filled with an orange fondant filling (similar to Cadbury's Creme Egg)

Advertising[edit]
The Chocolate Orange product is known for its unusual marketing, which is usually at its heaviest around Christmas. At one time it was estimated that the Chocolate Orange was found in a tenth of British Christmas stockings.[4] Actress Dawn French has fronted numerous campaigns for the brand, often in a posed scene of defending and hiding "her" Chocolate Orange from others. Famous marketing phrases include:

Tap it and unwrap it (since replaced with "whack and unwrap")
It's not Terry's, it's mine
Don't tap it... Whack it!

More recent advertisements (after the rebranding) do not feature French and contain the new slogan "Round but not round for long" (some include the Countdown theme tune). The newest advertising campaign in the United Kingdom features various situations in which people are trying to break the segments of their Terry's Chocolate Orange apart with the slogan "Smash it to pieces, love it to bits".

Development[edit]
Main article: Terry's
The company opened the Art Deco-style factory The Chocolate Works in 1926, and began launching new products.[1] These included the Dessert Chocolate Apple (1926), Terry's All Gold (1931) and the Chocolate Orange (1932). [2] At the onset of World War II, confectionery production was immediately halted. The factory was taken over by F. Hills and Sons of Manchester as a shadow factory to manufacture and repair aircraft propeller blades. With the factory handed back to the company post-war, production was difficult due to continued rationing in the United Kingdom, and limited imports of raw cocoa. In 1954, production of the chocolate apple was phased out in favour of increased production of the chocolate orange.[1]
In the North American market, where it has had a variety of importers over the years, it was briefly sold as a Tobler (maker of the Toblerone) product.
Chocolate oranges appeared on the South Korean market in the GS25 chain of convenience stores in 2017.




Korean packaging


Since 2005 and the closure of the Terry factory in York, Chocolate Orange products have been manufactured near Jankowice, Poland.[3]
In 1979, Terry's launched the Chocolate Lemon, but it was withdrawn three years later.[2]
Structure[edit]




Terry's Chocolate Orange Bar, a chocolate bar version of the Chocolate Orange


The Terry's Chocolate Orange comprises an orange-shaped ball of chocolate mixed with orange oil, divided into 20 segments, similar to a real orange, and wrapped in orange-skin patterned foil. When packaged, the segments are stuck together firmly in the centre; therefore, prior to unwrapping, the ball is traditionally tapped severely on a hard surface to cause the segments to separate from each other (dubbed "Tap and Unwrap" or "Whack and Unwrap").
Spin-offs[edit]
There have been a number of spin-off products, currently including:

Chocolate Orange bar: a bar of six segments, initially produced with smooth vertical segments (similar to a Toblerone bar), then, later, with textured segments that mimic the traditional orange shape.
Chocolate Orange minis: a bag of small segments
Chocolate Orange White Eggs: egg-shaped white-chocolate versions of Chocolate Orange that were available for one Easter
Segsations: individual segments of chocolate in different flavours, including: milk chocolate, puffed rice, honeycomb, cornflake, white chocolate and a "double seg" of layered milk and dark chocolate, all flavoured with orange oil.
Segsations Mini Eggs: individual foil-wrapped eggs of chocolate in same flavours as Segsations, for Easter
Chocolate Orange – Egg & Spoon: a milk chocolate egg filled with an orange fondant filling (similar to Cadbury's Creme Egg)

Advertising[edit]
The Chocolate Orange product is known for its unusual marketing, which is usually at its heaviest around Christmas. At one time it was estimated that the Chocolate Orange was found in a tenth of British Christmas stockings.[4] Actress Dawn French has fronted numerous campaigns for the brand, often in a posed scene of defending and hiding "her" Chocolate Orange from others. Famous marketing phrases include:

Tap it and unwrap it (since replaced with "whack and unwrap")
It's not Terry's, it's mine
Don't tap it... Whack it!

More recent advertisements (after the rebranding) do not feature French and contain the new slogan "Round but not round for long" (some include the Countdown theme tune). The newest advertising campaign in the United Kingdom features various situations in which people are trying to break the segments of their Terry's Chocolate Orange apart with the slogan "Smash it to pieces, love it to bits".
