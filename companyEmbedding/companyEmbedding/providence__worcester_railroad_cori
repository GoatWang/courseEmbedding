(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in connection with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of the Company's significant accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements. Not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.  Property and Equipment  The Company's rail operations are highly capital intensive. Property and equipment, including land held for development, is stated at historical cost (including self-construction costs). Self-construction costs for track structure include material costs for ties, rail, other track materials and ballast; the cost of direct and supervisory labor, including railroad retirement taxes and employee benefits; costs for track machinery and equipment (including depreciation) and various other overhead costs. Major renewals or betterments are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend asset lives are charged to expense when incurred. Costs are capitalized to the extent that they are incurred in connection with the replacement of track structure pursuant to a program of rehabilitation which results in significant future economic benefit or with the construction of new track structure. A program of rehabilitation or construction of new track structure generally includes ballast, rail and other track material and ties. Costs for routine maintenance are expensed. Routine maintenance items include the sporadic replacement of ties, replacement of track structure damaged in a derailment, washout or other cause or event and the costs of general upkeep of track structure to keep it in good operating condition. Costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the facts and circumstances of each specific project. The total amount of the costs to be capitalized is based on the per unit cost for each category of expenditure (ties, rail and other track material and ballast) and the number of equivalent units installed. Costs are developed using costs incurred for materials, direct labor and overhead.  Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their useful lives. Items included in track structures with similar physical characteristics, use, date of installation and expected life are grouped together into separate asset classes and depreciated by the estimated useful life for the asset class group. Gains or losses, if any, on sales or other dispositions of property are credited or charged to other income.  The Company reviews property and equipment retirements each year in order to determine whether or not the estimated useful lives are reasonable. Since, in most instances, assets retired have been fully or substantially depreciated, the Company has not found it necessary, historically, to make any significant adjustments to their estimated useful lives. Retirements of track structures are recorded by removing the historical cost and related accumulated depreciation of its oldest track structures with the related loss, if any, being charged to other income. Historically, the Company has not had any significant retirements of track infrastructure which it considers to be abnormal and not in the normal course of business.  The conclusions and ongoing evaluations of our estimated useful lives may result in future material changes in the Company's maintenance and capital spending, as well as revisions to the useful lives of property and equipment which may affect depreciation rates and expenses.  The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets in determining whether the carrying amounts of the assets are recoverable. If an impairment exists, the impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value to the fair value. No impairments were recognized in the two years presented.  II-2  Income Taxes  Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates of enactment. Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Overview  The Company is a freight railroad operating in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.  The Company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines. Freight revenues are estimated and recorded at the time shipments move onto the Company's track. Modest freight-related operating revenues are derived from demurrage, switching, weighing, special train and other transportation services. Other operating revenues are derived from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the Company's Maintenance of Way and Maintenance of Equipment departments. Operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income and rental income.  The Company's operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits, depreciation, insurance and casualty claim expense, diesel fuel, car hire, property taxes, materials and supplies, purchased services, track usage fees and other expenses. Many of the Company's operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the Company's management were to take specific actions to restructure the Company's operations.  When comparing the Company's results of operations from one year to another, the following factors should be taken into consideration. First, the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one�time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shutdowns. Second, the Company's freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international, national and regional economic conditions. Third, the volume of capitalized track or recollectible projects performed by the Company's Maintenance of Way department can vary significantly from year to year, thereby impacting total operating expenses. Fourth, diesel fuel comprises a significant portion of the Company's operating costs. As fuel prices increase the Company attempts to recover these costs through surcharges and increased fees; however, the Company's profitability can be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices.  The Company also generates other income through sales of properties, grants of easements and licenses. Other income or loss from the sale, condemnation, disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements and rights to use portions of its property is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectability is assured. Other income varies significantly from year to year.  One of the Company's customers, which mines construction aggregates from two active quarries on the Company's rail system and ships to destinations in Connecticut and New York, accounted for more than 10% of the Company's freight operating revenues in 2015 and 2014. The Company does not believe that the customer will cease to be a rail shipper in the foreseeable future. The Company does not control the quantities this company ships by rail.  Results of Operations  The following table sets forth the Company's operating revenues, exclusive of rental revenues of $717 thousand and $715 thousand in 2015 and 2014, respectively, by category in dollars and as a percentage of operating revenues:   Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 '(In thousands, except percentages) Freight Revenues: Conventional carloads $ 31,759 90.5 % $ 30,205 89.9 % Containers 1,217 3.5 1,479 4.4 Other freight related 977 2.8 830 2.5 Other Operating Revenues 1,127 3.2 1,089 3.2 Total $ 35,080 100.0 % $ 33,603 100.0 %   II-3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The following table sets forth conventional carload freight revenues by commodity group in dollars and as a percentage of such revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands, except percentages) Automobiles $ 3,016 9.5 % $ 2,310 7.6 % Chemicals and plastics (including ethanol) 12,330 38.8 11,404 37.8 Construction aggregates 6,613 20.8 6,195 20.5 Metal products 4,539 14.3 3,838 12.7 Food and agricultural products 1,716 5.4 1,705 5.6 Forest and paper products 2,424 7.7 2,979 9.9 Other 1,121 3.5 1,774 5.9 Total $ 31,759 100.0 % $ 30,205 100.0 %  The following table sets forth a comparison of the Company's operating expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of operating revenues, exclusive of rental revenues:   Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (In thousands, except percentages) Salaries, wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits $ 16,212 46.2 % $ 15,863 47.2 % Casualties and insurance 1,569 4.5 1,401 4.2 Depreciation 3,689 10.5 3,456 10.3 Diesel fuel 2,945 8.4 3,236 9.6 Car hire, net 1,671 4.8 1,098 3.3 Purchased services, including legal and professional fees 2,831 8.1 3,163 9.4 Repair and maintenance of equipment 1,581 4.5 1,852 5.5 Track and signal materials 1,045 3.0 1,224 3.6 Track usage fees 1,563 4.4 1,180 3.5 Other materials and supplies 1,899 5.4 1,564 4.7 Other 2,695 7.7 2,616 7.8 Total 37,700 107.5 36,653 109.1 Less capitalized and recovered costs, including amounts relating to the Amtrak Agreement1 4,489 12.8 5,496 16.4 Total $ 33,211 94.7 % $ 31,157 92.7 %  Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014  Operating Revenues, exclusive of rental revenues, increased $1.5 million, or 4.5%, to $35.1 million in 2015 from $33.6 million in 2014. This increase is the net result of a $1.6 million (5.1%) increase in conventional freight revenues, a $147 thousand (17.7%) increase in other freight-related revenues, a $38 thousand  The increase in conventional freight revenues is attributable to a 10.3% increase in traffic volume, offset by a 4.6% decrease in the average revenue received per carload. In 2015, the Company's conventional carloads increased by 3,617 to 38,813 from 35,196 in 2014. Shipments of automobiles and metal products during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively, to 9.5% and 14.3%, respectively, of total conventional carload freight revenue from 7.6% and 12.7%, respectively, from 2014 while shipments of other commodities remained constant over prior year levels. The decrease in the average revenue received per conventional carload is due to a shift of the mix of commodities, the origin of the shipments, and decrease in fuel surcharge revenue.  II-4  The decrease in container freight revenues is mainly the result of a 15.9% decreased traffic volume. Container volume decreased by 3,292 containers to 17,422 in 2015 from 20,714 in 2014. The decrease in container traffic is primarily a result of more international freight being transloaded at the west coast ports to domestic containers.  The increase in other freight-related revenues results from an increase in revenue from demurrage, switching, and other freight-related services while the increase in other operating revenues reflects an increase in maintenance department billings for services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties.  Other Income  Other income decreased by $431 thousand to $75 thousand in 2015 from $506 thousand in 2014. The decrease is attributable to gains from the sale and disposal of property and equipment in 2014.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 6.4%, to $33.2 million in 2015 from $31.2 million in 2014. The increase in operating expenses in 2015 was attributable mainly to increases in payroll related expense ($349 thousand), casualties and insurance expense ($168 thousand), depreciation expense ($233 thousand), car hire expense ($573 thousand), track usage fees ($383 thousand), and other materials and supplies ($335 thousand). These increases were partially offset by decreases in diesel fuel ($291 thousand), purchased services ($332 thousand), repairs and maintenance of equipment ($271 thousand), and track and signal materials expense ($179 thousand). The decrease in purchased services and in track and signal materials expense were attributable to projects performed by the Company's Maintenance of Way department for various state agencies. The decrease in recovered costs also relates to these same projects.  The Company utilized $418 and $801 thousand of the track usage fee offsets obtained via the Amtrak Agreement in 2015 and 2014, respectively. No credits remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company's income tax provision for 2015 was $831 thousand. This amount approximates the Company's expected tax rate plus a decrease in the Company's valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of $216 thousand (8% of the total effective tax rate). The Company's income tax provision for 2014 was $496 thousand. This amount approximates the Company's expected tax rate plus a decrease in the Company's valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of $852 thousand (23% of the total effective tax rate).  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During 2015 and 2014, the Company generated $4.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively, of cash from operating activities.  During 2015, the Company's cash flows used in investing activities were $6.3 million. The Company's expenditures for track structure replacement net of grants for the past two years were:  Net Expenditures for Track Structure Replacements   December 31, (In Thousands) 2015 $ 2,635 2014 $ 2,473  Substantially the entire mainline track owned by the Company meets FRA Class 3 standards, and the Company intends to continue to maintain this track at this level. The Company expended $2.6 million and $2.5 million for additions and improvements to its track structure in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company expects that on average it will continue to spend between $2 million and $3 million per year for capitalized track improvements adjusted annually for inflation. Improvements to the Company's track structure are made, for the most part, by the Company's Maintenance of Way Department personnel. The Company expended an additional $1.7 million during 2015 to rehabilitate four bridges. The Company anticipates spending an additional $1.5 million to replace one bridge during the spring of 2016. Once the rehabilitation and replacement are complete, the Company will have the ability to haul freight with a lading of 286,000 pounds on its main line from Worcester, MA to Davisville/Providence RI. Additionally, the Company anticipates constructing additional track within Cedar Hill yard, New Haven, CT for $750 thousand. By April 2016, the Company anticipates drawing down the remaining $4 million under its term loan agreement.  II-5  The Company's revolving credit line expires June 2017. Borrowings under this line of credit are unsecured, due on demand and bear interest at either the bank's prime rate or one and three-quarters percent over the thirty, sixty or ninety day London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") with a LIBOR floor of one and one-quarter percent.. The Company pays no commitment fee on this line and has no compensating balance requirements. The Company had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit as of December 31, 2015.  During 2015, the Company generated $1.5 million of cash from financing activities. For 2015, the primary components of cash flows from financing activities were $1.2 million proceeds from deferred grant and other income, $1.0 million drawdown of long term debt, partially offset by $781 thousand for the payment of dividends.  In 2015, the Company paid dividends in the amount of $5 per share, aggregating $3.2 thousand, on its outstanding noncumulative preferred stock and $0.16 per share, aggregating $778 thousand, on its outstanding common stock. In January 2016, the Company declared a preferred stock dividend of $5 per share ($3.2 thousand) and a $.04 dividend per common share ($193 thousand). Continued payment of such dividends is contingent upon the Company's continuing to have the necessary financial resources.  Diesel fuel comprises a significant portion of the Company's operating costs. The Company's profitability can be adversely impacted by fluctuation in fuel prices. Volatility in energy prices could have an effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude and natural gas; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges. Any of these items could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  The Company is a defendant in certain lawsuits relating to casualty losses, many of which are covered by insurance subject to a deductible. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for any expected liabilities which may result from disposition of such lawsuits.  On January 29, 2002, the Company received a "Notice of Potential Liability" from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") regarding an existing Superfund Site ("the Site") that includes the J.M. Mills Landfill in Cumberland, Rhode Island. EPA sends these "Notice" letters to potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"). EPA identified the Company as a PRP based on its status as an owner and/or operator because its railroad property traverses the Site. Via these Notice letters, EPA makes a demand for payment of past costs (identified in the letter as $762) and future costs associated with the response actions taken to address the contamination at the Site, and requests PRPs to indicate their willingness to participate and resolve their potential liability at the Site. The Company has responded to EPA by stating that it does not believe it has any liability for this Site, but that it is interested in cooperating with EPA to address issues concerning liability at the Site.  In connection with the EPA claim described above, the two parties who have committed to conduct the RI/FS at the Site filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island against the Company, in an action entitled CCL Custom Manufacturing, Inc. v. Arkwright Incorporated, et al (consolidated with Unilever Bestfoods v. American Steel & Aluminum Corp. et al), C.A. No. 01-496/L, on December 18, 2002. The Company was one of about sixty parties named by Plaintiffs, in this suit, to recover response costs incurred in investigating and responding to the releases of hazardous substances at the Site. Plaintiffs alleged that the Company is liable under 42 U.S.C. � 961(a)(3) of CERCLA as an "arranger" or "generator" of waste that ended up at the Site. The Company entered into a Generator Cooperation Agreement with other defendants to allocate costs in responding to this suit, and to share technical costs and information in evaluating the Plaintiffs' claims. Although the Company does not believe it generated any waste that ended up at this Site, or that its activities caused contamination at the Site, the Company paid $45 to settle this suit in March 2006. This settlement covered investigation costs; not cleanup costs.  The Government has now selected a remedy for the Site and has indicated that it will negotiate with all of the PRPs at the site to take over and or pay for the cleanup. As it did before, the Company responded to EPA stating that it is interested in cooperating with EPA but that it does not believe it has engaged in any activities that caused contamination at the Site. The Company believes that none of its activities caused contamination at the Site, and will contest this claim by EPA and therefore no liability has been accrued for this matter.  Pursuant to permits issued by the United States Department of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, the Company created 33 acres of waterfront land in East Providence, Rhode Island ("South Quay") investing nearly $12 million in its development. The permits for the property, which have been extended to December 2019 and December 2016, respectively, also allow for construction of a dock along the west face of the South Quay. The property is adjacent to a 12 acre site, also owned by the Company.  II-6  The property is located one-half mile from Interstate 195. In 2006, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation ("RIDOT") awarded a contract to construct Waterfront Drive, which provides direct vehicular access from the interstate highway system to the South Quay, which project was completed in 2007. In fall 2012, the extension of Waterfront Drive northward toward an industrial area, where the Company owns two additional waterfront parcels comprising 11 acres, creating direct access to such property, was completed. RIDOT is presently in the initial stages of designing improvements to access Waterfront Drive from Interstate 195 West.  The City of East Providence has created a waterfront redevelopment area with a zoning overlay to encourage development of offices, hotels, restaurants, shops, marinas, apartments and other "clean" employment. The Company has been cooperating with the City of East Providence in these efforts.  II-7  Mar 21, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Housatonic Railroad and branches, Danbury to Derby
MBTA and CSX - Boston and Providence Railroad (East Providence Branch and main line), Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad and Old Colony Railroad Newport line, Rhode Island/Massachusetts state line to Massachusetts/Rhode Island state line

Passenger excursions[edit]
The P&W operates occasional passenger excursions on its own lines and sometimes over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. It owns several ex-Amtrak passenger cars for that purpose.
History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

P&W operates over the following lines with overhead trackage rights, meaning it cannot serve on-line customers:

Metro-North's New Haven Line, New Haven (CT) to New Rochelle (NY), Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, New Rochelle (NY) to Pelham Bay (NY), and CSX running tracks, Pelham Bay to Fresh Pond Jct., NY (CSX has trackage rights to serve customers on Metro-North and Amtrak, if any)
Housatonic Railroad and branches, Danbury to Derby
MBTA and CSX - Boston and Providence Railroad (East Providence Branch and main line), Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad and Old Colony Railroad Newport line, Rhode Island/Massachusetts state line to Massachusetts/Rhode Island state line

Passenger excursions[edit]
The P&W operates occasional passenger excursions on its own lines and sometimes over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. It owns several ex-Amtrak passenger cars for that purpose.
History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]

The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

Passenger excursions[edit]
The P&W operates occasional passenger excursions on its own lines and sometimes over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. It owns several ex-Amtrak passenger cars for that purpose.
History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

Providence-Worcester Railroad is Sold

Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) (NYSE:GWR) announced today that it buying Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P&W)(NASDAQ: PWX) for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 million. 
The acquisition is expected to close following the receipt of P&W shareholder approval in the fourth quarter of 2016.
“The acquisition of P&W is an excellent strategic fit with G&W’s contiguous railroads, the New England Central and the Connecticut Southern. Following anticipated STB approval of the acquisition, our connectivity with the P&W enables us to realize substantial immediate cost savings,” said Jack Hellmann, President and Chief Executive Officer of G&W. “Our acquisition of the P&W will ultimately enhance the efficiency and customer service of rail in New England.”
Headquartered in Worcester, Mass., and operating in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, P&W is contiguous with G&W’s New England Central Railroad (NECR) and Connecticut Southern Railroad (CSO). 
Rail service is provided by approximately 140 P&W employees with 32 locomotives across 163 miles of owned track and over approximately 350 miles under track access agreements, including exclusive freight access over Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor between New Haven, Conn., and Providence, R.I., and trackage rights over Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Amtrak and CSX Corp. (NASDAQ: CSX) between New Haven, Conn., and Queens, N.Y. P&W interchanges with G&W’s NECR and CSO railroads, as well as with CSX, Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC), Pan Am Railways, Pan Am Southern, the Housatonic Railroad and the New York and Atlantic Railroad, and also connects to Canadian National (NYSE: CNI) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE: CP) via NECR.
P&W serves a diverse mix of aggregates, auto, chemicals, metals and lumber customers in southeastern New England, handling approximately 43,000 carloads and intermodal units annually. 
P&W provides rail service to three ports (Providence, Davisville and New Haven) and to a U.S. Customs bonded intermodal terminal in Worcester, Mass., that receives inbound intermodal containers for distribution in New England. P&W also owns approximately 45 acres of undeveloped waterfront land in East Providence, R.I., that was initially created as a deep water, rail served port through a $12 million investment. G&W expects to sell this undeveloped land.
Upon approval by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), P&W would be managed as part of G&W’s Northeast Region, led by Senior Vice President Dave Ebbrecht. The addition of P&W to G&W’s existing presence in the region substantially enhances G&W’s ability to serve customers and Class I partners in New England, which is a highly competitive rail market with a premium placed on timely, efficient and safe rail service. The acquisition is anticipated to unlock significant cost savings through overhead, operational and long-term network efficiencies as well as to generate significant new

Paul O’Reilly, Newport Restaurant Group
(2013 Ranking: NEW)
You may not know the name, but you have probably tasted the food. Paul O'Reilly oversees maybe the largest and most diversified restaurant group in Rhode Island. In a state loaded with great restaurateurs, O'Reilly’s collection is impressive: Castle Hill Inn; TRIO and 22 Bowen’s Wine Bar & Grille; the Mooring Seafood Kitchen & Bar; the seasonal Smokehouse Café; the Boat House; Waterman Grille; Hemenway’s Seafood Grill & Oyster Bar; and seven Papa Razzi locations.
In 2014, his Newport Harbor Corp. sold nearly 4 acres on the waterfront known as the Newport Yachting Center for tens of millions.

Stephanie and Lincoln Chafee, Philanthropist and former Candidate for President
(2013 Ranking: 2)
No one fell more in the rankings over the past two years than the Chafees. The fall in influence was driven by an embarrassing failed campaign for the Presidency that started poorly with a focus on the metric system and went downhill from there.
Make no mistake about it, Lincoln Chafee could have been a significant force in Rhode Island and national politics at the conclusion of his term as Governor. He had close ties to the Obama White House and left the office far less scathed than former Governors like Ed DiPrete or Don Carcieri.
The Chafees stay in the rankings because of two factors. They are good at comebacks and the Chafees are wealthy, and Stephanie's side of the family (Danforths) are in the 1% of the 1%. Back in 2006, Roll Call magazine ranked Chafee as the 9th richest member of Congress.
The husband and wife team's combined wealth is estimated at between $150 million and $200 million.

The Breadys - father Rick and son Barrett - are two of Rhode Island’s most ambitious and accomplished entrepreneurs. The past couple of years have been a mixed bag for the Breadys, as Barrett’s Nabsys collapsed after raising upwards of of $40+ million. It should be noted that the younger Bready had left the firm before it shuttered.
The father, Richard, hosted a major fundraiser for President Barack Obama in 2014 at his nearly $20 million mansion, named “Seafair.”

Under Steinberg, the Rhode Island Foundation has been reinvented from a sleepy charity to a dynamic innovator. Not every move has worked, but their has been no shortage of effort to spark and fund improvements to Rhode Island’s quality of life and economy.
Today, the Foundation is deeply involved in the community narrative. Its peer organization — the Champlin Foundation — continues to operate in a cloak of secrecy.
The former Fleet banker was an unlikely innovator, but the Foundation is now sparking a dizzying array of initiatives. With assets pushing towards $800 million, the Foundation is the largest grant making organization in Rhode Island.

Ned Handy, President and Chief Operating Officer, Washington Trust
(2013 Ranking: NEW)
In 2013, it was a bit of a hiring coup d'état when Joe MarcAurele recruited Handy to join Washington Trust as President and Chief Operating Officer. Previously, he had 18 years at Citizens Financial Group, and was President of Citizens Bank Rhode Island and Citizens Bank Connecticut. 
His Connecticut connections have been part of Washington Trust's Connecticut growth.

Myrth York, Political Influencer, Investor
(2013 Ranking: NEW)
She was arguably the King-maker in the last two Mayoral campaigns helping both Angel Taveras and Jorge Elorza win office, but in both cases once in office she has lost influence over each of them. The three-time Democratic nominee for Governor has been the titular head of the progressive wing of the Democratic party in RI for decades.
The former State Senator from the East Side went all in for both Gina Raimondo and Jorge Elorza and she won big. 
Recently, she scored an appointment to the Beacon Insurance Board as a part of a Chafee-Raimondo agreement.

No one may determine the future of Providence more than Van Saun. The CEO of Citizens has navigated the company's spin away from the Royal Bank of Scotland and its public offering. 
Now, he will set the course for the future of the city and his bank. 4,000 employees in downtown Providence would be great for the city, state and carbon foot print -- instead of thousands of cars driving to Smithfield.
He is a behind the scenes “data guy” and for Citizens to compete and grow the company will need to recruit smart technologists —and they don’t want to be working at a campus in the burbs. 
Van Saun has held a number of top jobs with Bank of New York and later Bank of New York Mellon, including Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. He is a director of Lloyd’s of London.
A Van Saun move to Providence and redevelopment of a downtown campus with the Superman building is a game changer for Rhode Island - they build statutes for people with that kind of vision.

The RI success story which has been among the fastest growing companies in America and was targeting an IPO has restructured and is looking to close out a rebound 2015.  That goal may have taken a hit when the company lost its Chief Marketing Officer Ryan Bonifacino going into fourth quarter.
The Alex and Ani involvement, donations and sponsorships in RI has been paired back and Rafaelian has closed two of her three coffee shops - Teas and Javas.
The company reported to have a value in the billions and she is still the largest shareholder.  A good holiday season and the karma will be good in Alex and Ani’s world, but a significant shortfall in annual sales and the company’s skyrocketing growth may look a little more mortal.

The biggest bet is the company’s acquisition of Newport Grand and the proposal to build a new facility in Tiverton with an expansion of table games. Tiverton is one of Rhode Island’s most rural and beautiful towns — but Taylor has gone door-to-door himself, explaining the benefits and putting his name on the line with residents.

Moreover, she has started to be a political force in Providence and Rhode Island wielding significant influence. She was a key player in resolving the nursing school dispute and her “pull the rug” letter ended the PawSox efforts in Providence on the 195 land.
She faces challenges as the Woodrow Wilson Center at Princeton that she ran before coming to Brown, which has become a lightning rod issue about the name-sakes racial legacy, and Brown students are beginning to stir on a number of race-related issues. She recently announced a $100 million effort to study racism.  
According tot he Chronicle of Higher Educations review, Paxson earns $739,000 (about one-sixth of her Ivy-League counterpart at Columbia).

Helena Foulkes, VP CVS
(2013 Ranking: NEW)
Foulkes, like Merlo, has had a good couple of years. She was in part the architect of the removal tobacco from the company’s 7,700 plus stores.
Fortune named her the #26 most powerful woman in business and she now is President of the Retail business.
Her father chairs the RI Convention Center Authority Board, her brother serves on the Commerce Corporation Board and her husband serves of the education board. There is no excuse for not being able to fix RI’s economy over Christmas dinner.
According to Salary.com, Foulkes made $6,064,082 in total compensation. Of this total $850,000 was received as a salary, $3,165,044 was received as a bonus, $624,992 was received in stock options, $1,249,927 was awarded as stock and $174,119 came from other types of compensation.

Joe Paolino, Paolino Properties
(2013 Ranking: 12)
If you are standing downtown and look left, right or up, then you are bound to see multiple elements of the Paolino real estate holdings. Never before has one company owned so much of the highest value property in downtown at the same time.
Similarly, it is hard to attend a Democratic Fundraiser without Paolino playing a key role. He is a top fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, helped Buddy Cianci’s failed effort to recapture City Hall in 2014, but even when he loses he seems to win. He failed to get voters in Newport to approve his plan to add table games to Newport Grand and so he flipped the property to Twin River and took his winnings off the table.

Paul Kazarian, Japonica Partners
(2013 Ranking: NEW)
RI based financier Paul Kazarian bet billions in the Greek debt crisis. The founder and CEO of Japonica Partners was a key player in the battle between Greece and the European Union. Kazarian’s company was one of the largest private bond holders in Greece. 
The former Goldman Sachs investment banker first made national headlines when he took control of Sunbean-Oster and made millions when he left as CEO of the company - it was not a happy break-up.
The family's Charles and Agnes Kazarian Eternal Foundation, named in honor of his grandparents, has assets in excess of $160 million (to put in perspective the Champlin Foundation has about $270 million in assets).

Gina Raimondo, Governor of Rhode Island
(2013 Ranking: 18)
Maybe the best resume ever to come out of Rhode Island. Raimondo was elected Rhode Island’s first female Governor and couple that accomplishment with her degrees from Harvard, Yale and a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford, and she is right there with John Pastore, T.F. Green, and John Chafee.
As General Treasurer she was the darling of the Wall Street Journal and other business publications for pension reform legislation. For many it was perceived as having saved the pension system, but detractors like Forbes columnist and former SEC investigator Ted Siedle claim it just pushed more wealth to Hedge Fund managers who have made hundreds of millions in fees from Rhode Island’s pension funds under Raimondo’s reign.
As Governor, she has proposed a massive funding program to rebuild Rhode Island’s dilapidated infrastructure. The proposal has come under criticism in part for utilizing a revenue bond structure - another program that will generate tens of millions in Wall Street fees.
Her husband Andrew Moffit is a business consultant at McKinsey & Company.  Her wealth in part comes from the State of Rhode Island’s investment in Point Judith Capital - she is a shareholder.

Jonathan Nelson, Founder Providence Equity Group
(2013 Ranking: 1)
The past two years have been a challenge for Jonathan Nelson and his Providence Equity Group. Once the golden boys of private equity and lauded for putting together “the biggest deal in the world,” he and the firm have had a series of set backs.
The highest profile bump was the firm’s loss of nearly $800 million in the firm, Altegrity, that was contracted to review federal contractors like Edward Snowden. As GoLocal reported last January, the domino effect of Snowden’s absconding with federal data bases exposed the deficiencies of Altegrity’s vetting process.
As the New York Times wrote in April, “Altegrity was the latest in a string of bad bets for the firm. Last summer, it lost its entire $460 million investment in a for-profit college company after that company faced multiple investigations. Hundreds of millions of dollars were erased when the film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer went bankrupt in 2010. A $675 million stake in an Internet retailer has been written down to zero, as has the $400 million it spent on a Dutch child-care group. The spate of poor investments caused Providence to deliver dismal returns in back-to-back funds.”
Please don’t distress too much over Nelson’s plight, he is still considered Rhode Island’s richest man by Forbes and his Providence Equity Partners still manages a self-reported $40 billion under management.

Larry Merlo, President and CEO of CVS
(2013 Ranking: 7)
Its been a good couple of years for Larry Merlo. In 2014, under his leadership, CVS stopped selling tobacco products which made the company a poster child for being a progressive, pro-health company.
Then, the First Lady, Michelle Obama asked him to be her guest last January at the State of the Union. Also, he scored a compensation package of $32 million in 2014.  Not a bad year for the CEO of the 12th ranked company on Fortune 500’s list.
In 2013, Merlo ranked 7th in GoLocal’s 2013 ranking, but his accumulated wealth and his craftsman-like leadership of CVS elevates Merlo to the position of the Most Wealthy and Influential for 2015.

History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

Passenger excursions[edit]
The P&W operates occasional passenger excursions on its own lines and sometimes over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. It owns several ex-Amtrak passenger cars for that purpose.
History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

Current lines[edit]




Providence & Worcester GP38-2 #2009


In addition to the original main line between Providence and Worcester, and the East Providence Branch, the P&W owns or provides freight service on the following lines, identified by their original companies:

Boston, Barre and Gardner Railroad, Worcester to Gardner
Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad, Woonsocket to Slatersville (North Smithfield)
Old Colony Railroad Newport line, Massachusetts/Rhode Island state line to Newport (bridge out at the Sakonnet River)
trackage rights over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Central Falls to New Haven
East Junction Branch - branch of Boston and Providence Railroad, East Providence to Rhode Island/Massachusetts state line
Norwich and Worcester Railroad, Worcester to Groton
Southbridge Running Track - Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad, Webster to Southbridge
Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, Plainfield to Willimantic
New York and Boston Air Line Railroad, Middletown to New Haven
Connecticut Valley Railroad, Hartford to Middletown
Naugatuck Railroad, Devon to Derby (trackage rights over Metro-North Railroad)
Danbury and Norwalk Railroad, Norwalk to Danbury

P&W operates over the following lines with overhead trackage rights, meaning it cannot serve on-line customers:

Metro-North's New Haven Line, New Haven (CT) to New Rochelle (NY), Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, New Rochelle (NY) to Pelham Bay (NY), and CSX running tracks, Pelham Bay to Fresh Pond Jct., NY (CSX has trackage rights to serve customers on Metro-North and Amtrak, if any)
Housatonic Railroad and branches, Danbury to Derby
MBTA and CSX - Boston and Providence Railroad (East Providence Branch and main line), Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad and Old Colony Railroad Newport line, Rhode Island/Massachusetts state line to Massachusetts/Rhode Island state line

Passenger excursions[edit]
The P&W operates occasional passenger excursions on its own lines and sometimes over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. It owns several ex-Amtrak passenger cars for that purpose.
History[edit]




Providence and Worcester GE Locomotive #4006 seen in Plainfield, CT


The P&W was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Providence and Worcester Railway on March 12, 1844, and as the Providence and Worcester Railroad in Rhode Island in May 1844. The two companies were merged November 25, 1845 as the Providence and Worcester Railroad. The company bought the Blackstone Canal, also running between Providence and Worcester, and began construction, partly on its banks, in 1845.[2]
The line opened in two sections, the part south of Millville on September 27, 1847, and the rest on October 20. The line from Providence to Central Falls was shared with the Boston and Providence Railroad, which at the same time built a connection from its old line (ending in East Providence) over to the P&W.
On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the P&W for 99 years. The New Haven merged into Penn Central on January 1, 1969. On April 6, 1970, the P&W announced its intention to separate from the merger. After a legal battle, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved the request on August 25, 1972, and, on November 2, Penn Central signed the agreement, effective December 30. The P&W cancelled the lease on February 3, 1973. Since then, the P&W has taken over many other lines from the former Penn Central in addition to several from the Boston and Maine Railroad. On March 17, 2013, a freight derailed in New Haven, Connecticut, blocking Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.
On August 15, 2016, Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (G&W) announced that it will buy Providence and Worcester Railroad Company for $25.00 per share, or approximately $126 Million.[3] The acquisition was completed on November 1, 2016, and the Surface Transportation Board approved the acquisition on December 16, 2016.[4][1]
Branches[edit]
The East Providence Branch Railroad was the only branch built by the P&W. Chartered in 1874 and opened in 1875, it split from the main line at Valley Falls and ran southeast and south, clipping the corner of Attleboro, Massachusetts and running through Pawtucket, and East Providence crossing both the Boston and Providence Railroad and the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad, and ending at the Wilkes-Barre Pier.
The East Providence Branch was also the P&W's only branch when it was leased to the NYNH&H, but previously it had leased several other railroads.
The Milford and Woonsocket Railroad was incorporated in 1855 and opened in 1868 from Milford to Bellingham. Soon after, the P&W leased it, despite it not being connected directly to the P&W. The Hopkinton Railway was leased in 1870 and opened in 1872, continuing the M&W north from Milford to Ashland. It too was leased to the P&W, on completion. Both leases expired in 1883 and were not renewed. The M&W bought the Hopkinton in 1884, and in 1897 the New England Railroad leased them, with a direct connection at Milford.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
