7 Investment terms to know
Investing has a language all its own. Do you ever wonder what a mutual fund, ETF, preferred stock or tax-exempt bond is? If so, here's a quick overview of seven basic investing terms that may be unfamiliar to you.

								Yes, take me there 













Programs we offer
Investing is a journey that starts with a holistic, customized strategy – something our financial representatives specialize in. They'll help you choose from a range of investment options – including mutual funds and managed accounts – to build a diversified portfolio specific to your unique goals and preferences.



Mutual funds



Thrivent Mutual Funds spread your risk across various investments, and are managed by investment  professionals. In addition to diversification and professional money  management, mutual funds offer liquidity, which means you can access your  assets at any time. 





Retail brokerage accounts 



Thrivent retail brokerage accounts let you expand your portfolio by investing directly in individual stocks, bonds or a wider range of mutual funds. Certain Thrivent Representatives may limit their offerings to mutual funds within the retail brokerage account. In any case, you have access to hundreds of investments; you make all investment decisions. You pay a commission or sales charge on each transaction.



Managed Account Programs
Our Managed Account programs provide ongoing investment advice – along with personalized service – to help keep you on track with your investment goals. These programs vary, allowing you to choose how involved you want to be with investment decisions. The annual fee is determined based on a percentage of your assets and aligned to the level of service that is right for you.



 Shepherd Managed Portfolios (Vanguard ETF)2



Thrivent Shepherd Managed Portfolios combine four decades of indexing expertise with Vanguard's low cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  You choose from a series of well-diversified portfolios managed by Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group.





 Genesis Managed Portfolios2



With this program you gain access to portfolios constructed by BlackRock's Model Portfolio Solutions team composed of cost-effective iShares ETFs.  A pioneer in ETF portfolio construction, BlackRock takes a more tactical approach to investing by strategically crafting their allocations to identify the best investment opportunities.





 SELECT Managed Portfolios2



SELECT Managed Portfolios are actively managed byThrivent Asset Management personnel and offer tax-deferred or tax-sensitive options consisting of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  These portfolios are designed with a range of investment styles to help you meet your financial goals as they grow and change.





 Income-Focused Managed Portfolios2



The Thrivent Income-Focused Managed Portfolio offers two model portfolios managed by Thrivent Asset Management personnel; each with two distribution options. One model distributes all interest, dividends and capital gains to clients at intervals they choose. The other automatically reinvests all income back into the account. Each model is built using a variety of asset classes, investment styles and a combination of actively managed mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. 





 Advisor Program2



Thrivent Advisor Program lets you work with your Thrivent Financial Representative to build a portfolio using a variety of investments, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, options, unit investment trusts and exchange-traded funds. While your Thrivent Financial Representative will provide ongoing guidance and help manage your assets, you are empowered to make all the investment decisions. 





 Thrivent AdvisorFlex Managed Variable Annuity Program2



Thrivent AdvisorFlex Managed Variable Annuity Program combines the benefits of having a flexible premium deferred variable annuity with the personalized service of an advisory program.  You’ll have the option to choose from a variety of sub account investment options.





 Advisor Guided Program



Thrivent Advisor Guided Program is a discretionary investment advisory program. This means your financial representative develops an agreed-upon asset allocation strategy or model portfolio using a variety of investments, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, options, unit investment trusts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Your financial representative buys, sells or effects transactions in your account, which may include adjusting the strategy or model account portfolio. 





 Separately Managed Accounts2



Thrivent Separately Managed Accounts give you access to investment advisory services provided by select third-party money managers. You benefit from their experience and receive an investment strategy designed to achieve your investment objectives, taking into account your goals and risk management requirements.





 Unified Managed Accounts2



Thrivent Unified Managed Accounts bring together all investment services.  Your Thrivent Financial representative will analyze your investment objectives and provide recommendations as to how you can effectively allocate your account assets among the available third-party money managers, mutual funds and ETF options. By centralizing your assets within this program, you'll be assured your investments are coordinated under one investment strategy.

      SAFE & SOUND® STAR RATINGS™
    THRIVENT TRUST CO.APPLETON, Wisconsin 54919STAR RATING: 4
    Predictive Indicator
    + (improve)
    As of
    
        March 31,
      2016
    Federal Reserve System Identifier 2745529HOLDING COMPANY INFORMATION(Based on data from the previous quarter.)This bank is not owned by a holding company.INTRODUCTIONU.S. commercial banks are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the purposes of accepting funds for deposit and extending loans to either individual or business borrowers. Banks are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, because of both their public purpose and their importance to the nation’s economy, banks become the object of intense regulatory scrutiny.U.S. thrift institutions are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the primary purpose of  utilizing deposited funds to issue loans secured by real estate.  Currently, real estate-backed loans account for approximately 42% of total thrift industry assets, and one-to-four family residential mortgages comprise nearly 59% of the industry’s real estate loan portfolio. Thrift institutions are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, during the last twenty years, thrifts have made great strides toward reducing historic mismatches between asset and liability maturities.
        The Bankrate proprietary commercial bank rating model analyzes capitalization,
        asset quality, earnings, and liquidity and produces composite and component
        "Star" ratings that can be used as a measure of the rated entity's financial
        safety and soundness. Additionally, early warning components of the model
        highlight operating characteristics of immediate concern and recommended
        follow-up actions. "The analyses are not adjusted for TARP funding and those
        institutions receiving funds may receive ratings that would differ were the
        TARP funds adjusted out of the analyses. You can check whether or not this
        institution has received TARP funding and whether or not they have paid it
        back at http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list/index."

            Early warning indicators identify areas of potential concern, which may lead to financial deterioration and thus, require inquiry or in-depth investigation.
            For this bank we have noted:
          Net Interest MarginOverheadInstitution CommentaryOVERVIEW of InstitutionTHRIVENT TRUST CO., which, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        reported $10.287 million in total assets.
        At that date, loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to
        $0 thousand and $2 million,
        respectively. The bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        equity base of $7.922 million produced an Equity/Assets ratio of
        77.01%, as of that date.
      COMPOSITE SUMMARY
        Bankrate believes that, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        this bank exhibited a sound condition, characterized by
        substantially lower than normal overall, sustainable profitability,
        a very high measure of asset quality,
        very strong capitalization and
        seemingly ample liquidity.
      EARNINGS ANALYSIS
        For the twelve months ended
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank recorded a net loss
        of $-62 thousand. The bank experienced a return on average assets (ROA) of
        -0.62% over the latest four quarters. Year earlier
        twelve month results amounted to a net income
        of $241 thousand, or a
        2.46%
        ROA over the most recent four quarters at that time. An ROA of at least 1.0% is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking
        industry standards, and the industry's annualized ROA for the twelve months
        of 2016 was approximately 0.95% for commercial banks
        and 1.25% for thrift institutions.
      
        We have concluded that for the four quarters ending
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank achieved substantially below average
        return on equity
          , and, as noted,
          sustained an actual loss for that period
        .
        We deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average, and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition, asset yields, and liability costs.
        Noninterest income was solid.
        We also observed overhead ratios that were significantly higher than average, and the composition of overhead should be thoroughly analyzed.
        Importantly, net interest margins, noninterest income components, and overhead expense levels
        represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results.
        ASSET QUALITY ANALYSIS
        The bank revealed, as previously stated, a very high measure of
        asset quality. Our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis
        of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of
        a relatively low
            March 31,
          2016 nonperforming asset ratio,
        much better than normal
        reserve coverage for nonperforming loans; and
        apparently acceptable quality, or no greater than average,
        holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans, two categories
        that can intensify credit risk.
        
          Other asset categories, such as farm and consumer loans, which may carry
          more than usual default potential, should not have a substantial negative impact
          upon future results.
        Loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk. Excessive loan yield may be an
        indicator of existing or future problems. Our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a
        seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward.
        CAPITAL ANALYSIS
        For the one year period ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank reported
        an approximately normal rate of growth in equity capital.
        Balance sheet structural changes, through the one year period of time ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, have
        improved
        the bank's capital position. Our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity,
        quality, and durability of net worth, and, as set forth above, we have determined, based upon
        our series of tests, that the bank demonstrates
        very strong
        capitalization. We have calculated the bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        Total Risk-Based Capital position, a computation used by industry regulators, and have concluded
        that this bank substantially exceeded
        the requirement, set by regulation, for this test.
        LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS
        As of
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank displayed
        Much Better Than Normal
        balance sheet liquidity and a
        No Greater Than Average Dependence
        upon wholesale, or non-core liabilities, which include all borrowings, such as Federal Home
        Loan Bank Advances, and CD's greater than $250,000.
        
        Accounting principles require some securities to be categorized as "Available-for-Sale."
        Changes in market value of these securities are reflected through the GAAP (Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles) net worth of the institution. Based upon the bank's
        present balance sheet, changes in the value of the current level of securities reported
        as "Available-for-Sale"
        are almost certain to have a substantial impact
        upon future net worth of the bank.
      INSTITUTION SUMMARY
        This bank has been rated
        sound.
      
          Negative factors that impacted that rating follow:Earnings
          Positive factors that impacted that rating follow:Asset QualityCapitalization
          As noted previously, early warning indicators, possibly requiring specific
          investigation include:
        Net Interest MarginOverheadPREDICTIVE INDICATOR
        As stated, we have determined a composite Star rating for this bank of
        
            4
            
        , indicative of a
        sound
        financial condition. At times, financial conditions of banks change rapidly and significantly.
        Hence, our Safe & Sound Star ratings should not be deemed predictive of likely future ratings.
        However, in view of early warning indicators set forth within this report, in combination with
        the institution's financial data, we believe that the Star rating for this institution is
        
            likely to improve
          
        within the ensuing twelve month period.

I wish I would have never heard of Meramec Valley Bank and used a bank of higher quality and more honor. Jim Jones is a vindictive person. I recommend you stay away from this "bank"

DO NOT USE THIS BANK.  I took out a CD and got the contract, but Providence reneged on the contract and did not compensate me for their early retirement as they would charge me if I were to withdraw.
