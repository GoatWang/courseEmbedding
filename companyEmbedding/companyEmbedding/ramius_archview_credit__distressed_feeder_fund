Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Fund currently serves as the master fund in a master-feeder structure with one feeder fund.[1] 
           If the requested relief is granted, the feeder fund will be dissolved promptly and the Fund will no longer operate within a master-feeder structure.[2] 
           The Fund's investment objective is to seek to generate consistent, total returns while minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund intends to pursue its investment objective by investing primarily in debt and equity securities, loans, trade claims and derivative instruments of leveraged or financially distressed companies. In addition, the Fund will typically take long and short positions in securities, loans and derivatives.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”), acts as the distributor of the Fund.
3. The Fund continuously offers its Shares [3] 
           to investors that represent that they are “qualified clients” within the meaning of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act (“Qualified Clients”). Shares of the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will develop for the Shares.
4. The Fund currently offers a single class of Shares (the “Initial Class”) at net asset value per share without a sales load and without an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. The Fund proposes to issue multiple classes of Shares and specifically proposes to offer a new Share class (the “New Class”): (1) Only to Qualified Clients; (2) at net asset value plus a front-end sales load of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an annual distribution/shareholder fee of 0.75%. The front-end sales load and annual distribution/shareholder servicing fee to be charged to the New Class Shares will be the same as those currently charged to the feeder fund Shares. The Fund intends to continue to offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales load and without a service and/or distribution fee.
5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to shareholders, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the Fund's net asset value, at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act pursuant to written tenders by shareholders.[4] 
           Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of trustees (“Board”), in its sole discretion.[5] 
           Repurchases will not commence for at least six months following the date of the initial closing for subscriptions for Shares. Following such date, the Adviser will recommend to the Board (subject to its discretion) that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser acts as investment adviser and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.[6] 

7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”) as if that rule applied to the Fund.[7] 
           Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its prospectus, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus as is required for open-end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its prospectus.[8] 
           The Fund will also comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor.[9] 
           The Fund will contractually require that the Distributor and any other distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of Shares of the Fund.
8. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis Start Printed Page 37656by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
9. In the event the Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c).
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
 CDSCs
Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund will apply the CDSC (and any waivers, scheduled variations or eliminations of the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.
Applicants' Condition
The applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained via the Commission’s
Web site by searching for the file
number, or an applicant using the
Company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by
calling (202) 551–8090.
Applicants’ Representations
1. The Fund is a continuously offered
closed-end management investment
company registered under the Act and
organized as a Delaware statutory trust.
The Fund currently serves as the master
fund in a master-feeder structure with
one feeder fund.1 If the requested relief
is granted, the feeder fund will be
dissolved promptly and the Fund will
no longer operate within a master-feeder
structure.2 The Fund’s investment
objective is to seek to generate
consistent, total returns while
minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund
intends to pursue its investment
objective by investing primarily in debt
and equity securities, loans, trade
claims and derivative instruments of
leveraged or financially distressed
companies. In addition, the Fund will
typically take long and short positions
in securities, loans and derivatives.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited
liability company, is registered as an
investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(‘‘Advisers Act’’). The Adviser serves as
investment adviser to the Fund.
Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a brokerdealer registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘1934 Act’’), acts
as the distributor of the Fund.
3. The Fund continuously offers its
Shares 3 to investors that represent that
they are ‘‘qualified clients’’ within the
meaning of Rule 205–3 under the
Advisers Act (‘‘Qualified Clients’’).
Shares of the Fund are not listed on any
securities exchange and do not trade on
an over-the-counter system such as
NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that
any secondary market will develop for
the Shares.
4. The Fund currently offers a single
class of Shares (the ‘‘Initial Class’’) at
net asset value per share without a sales
load and without an annual asset-based
1 The feeder fund is Ramius Archview Credit and
Distressed Feeder Fund.
2 In accordance with the organizational
documents of the feeder fund and Delaware
statutory trust law, no shareholder vote is required
to liquidate and dissolve the feeder fund.
3 ‘‘Shares’’ includes any other equivalent
designation of a proportionate ownership interest of
the Fund.

service and/or distribution fee. The
Fund proposes to issue multiple classes
of Shares and specifically proposes to
offer a new Share class (the ‘‘New
Class’’): (1) Only to Qualified Clients; (2)
at net asset value plus a front-end sales
load of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an
annual distribution/shareholder fee of
0.75%. The front-end sales load and
annual distribution/shareholder
servicing fee to be charged to the New
Class Shares will be the same as those
currently charged to the feeder fund
Shares. The Fund intends to continue to
offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales
load and without a service and/or
distribution fee.
5. In order to provide a limited degree
of liquidity to shareholders, the Fund
may from time to time offer to
repurchase Shares, in an amount not to
exceed 25% of the Fund’s net asset
value, at their then current net asset
value in accordance with rule 13e–4
under the 1934 Act pursuant to written
tenders by shareholders.4 Repurchases
will be made at such times, in such
amounts and on such terms as may be
determined by the Fund’s board of
trustees (‘‘Board’’), in its sole
discretion.5 Repurchases will not
commence for at least six months
following the date of the initial closing
for subscriptions for Shares. Following
such date, the Adviser will recommend
to the Board (subject to its discretion)
that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares
from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
6. Applicants request that the order
also apply to any other continuously
offered registered closed-end
management investment company
existing now or in the future for which
the Adviser or any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser acts as investment
adviser and which provides periodic
liquidity with respect to its Shares
through tender offers conducted in
compliance with rule 13e–4 under the
1934 Act.6
4 Likewise, the feeder fund’s repurchase offers are
conducted pursuant to rule 13e–4 under the 1934
Act.
5 Shares are subject to an Early Repurchase Fee
at a rate of 2% of the net asset value of any Shares
repurchased by the Fund that were held for less
than one year. The Early Repurchase Fee will
equally apply to all shareholders of the Fund,
regardless of class, consistent with section 18 of the
Act and rule 18f–3 under the Act. To the extent the
Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled
variations of, or eliminate the Early Repurchase Fee,
it will do so consistently with the requirements of
rule 22d–1 under the Act as if the Early Repurchase
Fee were a CDSC and as if the Fund were an openend investment company, and the Fund’s waiver of,
scheduled variation in, or elimination of, the Early
Repurchase Fee will apply uniformly to all
shareholders of the Fund.
6 The Fund and any other investment company
relying on the requested relief will do so in a

7. Applicants represent that any assetbased service and/or distribution fees
will comply with the provisions of rule
2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the
National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (‘‘NASD Conduct Rule
2830’’) as if that rule applied to the
Fund.7 Applicants also represent that
the Fund will disclose in its prospectus,
the fees, expenses and other
characteristics of each class of Shares
offered for sale by the prospectus as is
required for open-end multiple class
funds under Form N–1A. As is required
for open-end funds, the Fund will
disclose its expenses in shareholder
reports, and disclose any arrangements
that result in breakpoints in or
elimination of sales loads in its
prospectus.8 The Fund will also comply
with any requirements that may be
adopted by the Commission or FINRA
regarding disclosure at the point of sale
and in transaction confirmations about
the costs and conflicts of interest arising
out of the distribution of open-end
investment company shares, and
regarding prospectus disclosure of sales
loads and revenue sharing arrangements
as if those requirements applied to the
Fund and the Distributor.9 The Fund
will contractually require that the
Distributor and any other distributor of
the Fund’s Shares comply with such
requirements in connection with the
distribution of Shares of the Fund.
8. The Fund will allocate all expenses
incurred by it among the various classes
of Shares based on the net assets of the
Fund attributable to each class, except
that the net asset value and expenses of
each class will reflect distribution fees,
service fees, and any other incremental
expenses of that class. Expenses of the
Fund allocated to a particular class of
Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis
manner consistent with the terms and conditions of
the application. Applicants represent that any
person presently intending to rely on the requested
relief is listed as an applicant.

include any successor or replacement rule that may
be adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (‘‘FINRA’’).

by each outstanding Share of that class.
Applicants state that the Fund will
comply with the provisions of rule 18f–
3 under the Act as if it were an openend investment company.
9. In the event the Fund imposes a
CDSC, the applicants will comply with
the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the
Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end
management investment companies.
With respect to any waiver of,
scheduled variation in, or elimination of
the CDSC, the Fund will comply with

were an open-end investment company.
Applicants’ Legal Analysis

asabaliauskas on DSK3SPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides,
in relevant part, that a closed-end
investment company may not issue or
sell any senior security if, immediately
thereafter, the company has outstanding
more than one class of senior security.
Applicants state that the creation of
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund
may be prohibited by section 18(c).
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides
that each share of stock issued by a
registered management investment
company will be a voting stock and
have equal voting rights with every
other outstanding voting stock.
Applicants state that permitting
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund
may violate section 18(i) of the Act
because each class would be entitled to
exclusive voting rights with respect to
matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
person, security or transaction or any
class or classes of persons, securities or
transactions from any provision of the
Act, or from any rule under the Act, if
and to the extent such exemption is
necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicants
request an exemption under section 6(c)
from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit
the Fund to issue multiple classes of
Shares.
4. Applicants submit that the
proposed allocation of expenses and
voting rights among multiple classes is
equitable and will not discriminate
against any group or class of
shareholders. Applicants submit that
the proposed arrangements would
permit the Fund to facilitate the
distribution of its Shares and provide
investors with a broader choice of
shareholder options. Applicants assert
that the proposed closed-end
investment company multiple class

Jkt 238001

structure does not raise the concerns
underlying section 18 of the Act to any
greater degree than open-end
investment companies’ multiple class
structures that are permitted by rule
18f–3 under the Act. Applicants state
that the Fund will comply with the
provisions of rule 18f–3 as if it were an
open-end investment company.
CDSCs
Applicants believe that the requested
relief meets the standards of section 6(c)
of the Act. Rule 6c–10 under the Act
permits open-end investment
companies to impose CDSCs, subject to
certain conditions. Applicants state that
any CDSC imposed by the Fund will
comply with rule 6c–10 under the Act
as if the rule were applicable to closedend investment companies. The Fund
also will disclose CDSCs in accordance
with the requirements of Form N–1A
concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were
an open-end investment company.
Applicants further state that the Fund
will apply the CDSC (and any waivers,
scheduled variations or eliminations of
the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders
in a given class and consistently with
the requirements of rule 22d–1 under
the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution
Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit an
affiliated person of a registered
investment company or an affiliated
person of such person, acting as
principal, from participating in or
effecting any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or joint
arrangement in which the investment
company participates unless the
Commission issues an order permitting
the transaction. In reviewing
applications submitted under section
17(d) and rule 17d–1, the Commission
considers whether the participation of
the investment company in a joint
enterprise or joint arrangement is
consistent with the provisions, policies
and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which the participation is on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d–3 under the Act provides
an exemption from section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 to permit open-end
investment companies to enter into
distribution arrangements pursuant to
rule 12b–1 under the Act. Applicants
request an order under section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 under the Act to permit the
Fund to impose asset-based service and/
or distribution fees. Applicants have
agreed to comply with rules 12b–1 and

PO 00000

Frm 00091

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

17d–3 as if those rules applied to
closed-end investment companies.
Applicants’ Condition
The applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the
provisions of rules 6c–10, 12b–1, 17d–
3, 18f–3 and 22d–1 under the Act, as
amended from time to time or replaced,
as if those rules applied to closed-end
management investment companies,
and will comply with NASD Conduct
Rule 2830, as amended from time to
time, as if that rule applied to all closedend management investment
companies.

Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end management 
investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware 
statutory trust. The Fund currently serves as the master fund in a 
master-feeder structure with one feeder fund.\1\ If the requested 
relief is granted, the feeder fund will be dissolved promptly and the 
Fund will no longer operate within a master-feeder structure.\2\ The 
Fund's investment objective is to seek to generate consistent, total 
returns while minimizing the risk of loss. The Fund intends to pursue 
its investment objective by investing primarily in debt and equity 
securities, loans, trade claims and derivative instruments of leveraged 
or financially distressed companies. In addition, the Fund will 
typically take long and short positions in securities, loans and 
derivatives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The feeder fund is Ramius Archview Credit and Distressed 
Feeder Fund.
    \2\ In accordance with the organizational documents of the 
feeder fund and Delaware statutory trust law, no shareholder vote is 
required to liquidate and dissolve the feeder fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered 
as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 
(``Advisers Act''). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the 
Fund. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, a broker-dealer registered under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``1934 Act''), acts as the distributor 
of the Fund.
    3. The Fund continuously offers its Shares \3\ to investors that 
represent that they are ``qualified clients'' within the meaning of 
Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act (``Qualified Clients''). Shares of 
the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on 
an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect 
that any secondary market will develop for the Shares.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Shares'' includes any other equivalent designation of a 
proportionate ownership interest of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. The Fund currently offers a single class of Shares (the 
``Initial Class'') at net asset value per share without a sales load 
and without an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. The 
Fund proposes to issue multiple classes of Shares and specifically 
proposes to offer a new Share class (the ``New Class''): (1) Only to 
Qualified Clients; (2) at net asset value plus a front-end sales load 
of up to 3%; and (3) subject to an annual distribution/shareholder fee 
of 0.75%. The front-end sales load and annual distribution/shareholder 
servicing fee to be charged to the New Class Shares will be the same as 
those currently charged to the feeder fund Shares. The Fund intends to 
continue to offer Initial Class Shares, without a sales load and 
without a service and/or distribution fee.
    5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to 
shareholders, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase 
Shares, in an amount not to exceed 25% of the Fund's net asset value, 
at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 
under the 1934 Act pursuant to written tenders by shareholders.\4\ 
Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such 
terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of trustees (``Board''), 
in its sole discretion.\5\ Repurchases will not commence for at least 
six months following the date of the initial closing for subscriptions 
for Shares. Following such date, the Adviser will recommend to the 
Board (subject to its discretion) that the Fund offer to repurchase 
Shares from shareholders on a quarterly basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Likewise, the feeder fund's repurchase offers are conducted 
pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.
    \5\ Shares are subject to an Early Repurchase Fee at a rate of 
2% of the net asset value of any Shares repurchased by the Fund that 
were held for less than one year. The Early Repurchase Fee will 
equally apply to all shareholders of the Fund, regardless of class, 
consistent with section 18 of the Act and rule 18f-3 under the Act. 
To the extent the Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled 
variations of, or eliminate the Early Repurchase Fee, it will do so 
consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if 
the Early Repurchase Fee were a CDSC and as if the Fund were an 
open-end investment company, and the Fund's waiver of, scheduled 
variation in, or elimination of, the Early Repurchase Fee will apply 
uniformly to all shareholders of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other 
continuously offered registered closed-end management investment 
company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any 
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
Adviser acts as investment adviser and which provides periodic 
liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in 
compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The Fund and any other investment company relying on the 
requested relief will do so in a manner consistent with the terms 
and conditions of the application. Applicants represent that any 
person presently intending to rely on the requested relief is listed 
as an applicant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or 
distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of 
the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, 
Inc. (``NASD Conduct Rule 2830'') as if that rule applied to the 
Fund.\7\ Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its 
prospectus, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class 
of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus as is required for open-
end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end 
funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and 
disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination 
of sales loads in its prospectus.\8\ The Fund will also comply with any 
requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding 
disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about 
the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of 
open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure 
of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those 
requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor.\9\ The Fund will 
contractually require that the Distributor and any other distributor of 
the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the 
distribution of Shares of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ All references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any 
successor or replacement rule that may be adopted by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA'').
    \8\ See Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure 
of Registered Management Investment Companies, Investment Company 
Act Release No. 26372 (Feb. 27, 2004) (adopting release) (requiring 
open-end investment companies to disclose fund expenses in 
shareholder reports); and Disclosure of Breakpoint Discounts by 
Mutual Funds, Investment Company Act Release No. 26464 (June 7, 
2004) (adopting release) (requiring open-end investment companies to 
provide prospectus disclosure of certain sales load information).
    \9\ See, e.g., Confirmation Requirements and Point of Sale 
Disclosure Requirements for Transactions and Certain Mutual Funds 
and Other Securities, and Other Confirmation Requirement Amendments, 
and Amendments to the Registration Form for Mutual Funds, Investment 
Company Act Release No. 26341 (Jan. 29, 2004) (proposing release).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the 
various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund 
attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and 
expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, 
and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund 
allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata 
basis

[[Page 37656]]

by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund 
will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it 
were an open-end investment company.
    9. In the event the Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply 
with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule 
applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to 
any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the 
Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund were an 
open-end investment company.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

Multiple Classes of Shares

    1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a 
closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security 
if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one 
class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of 
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 
18(c).
    2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock 
issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting 
stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting 
stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of 
the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would 
be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely 
related to that class.
    3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, 
securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any 
rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection 
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and 
provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 
6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple 
classes of Shares.
    4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and 
voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not 
discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants 
submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to 
facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a 
broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the 
proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does 
not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater 
degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures 
that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that 
the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an 
open-end investment company.

 CDSCs

    Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of 
section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end 
investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. 
Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with 
rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end 
investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance 
with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were 
an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund 
will apply the CDSC (and any waivers, scheduled variations or 
eliminations of the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given 
class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the 
Act.

Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from 
participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any 
joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company 
participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the 
transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) 
and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of 
the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is 
consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and 
the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 
17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter 
into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. 
Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under 
the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or 
distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 
and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.

Applicants' Condition

    The applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief 
will be subject to the following condition:
    Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 
17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or 
replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment 
companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from 
time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management 
investment companies.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Robert W. Errett,
Deputy Secretary.
