Personal InjuryYou are here:HomeAreas of PracticePersonal Injury









If you have been injured in an accident that resulted from the carelessness, recklessness, or misconduct of another, you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries. A personal injury can cause damage to physical and emotional health, impact your earning potential, place a strain on your personal life and lead to costly future medical care. Our law firm specializes in helping clients obtain compensation for these and countless other damages they have suffered at the hands of another’s negligence. Our firm has experience with all types of personal injury cases, including:
Motor Vehicle Accidents
If you have been injured in a car accident, you need experienced representation on your side to ensure that you receive just compensation from the parties responsible. Injuries suffered during an automobile accident can have devastating impacts on all aspects of your life. Without competent legal representation, insurance companies will do anything in their power to avoid compensating you for these injuries. At Sgro & Roger, we can help you recover maximum compensation for the damage caused to your vehicle, you or your loved one’s necessary medical treatment, the pain and suffering your injuries are causing, your lost wages, and for the impact your injuries have on your quality of life. No matter how severe the accident, our team of personal injury attorneys can help you to get the medical care you need and assist you in achieving the best possible outcome for your case.
You do not have to go through this difficult time alone. Give us a call, and let our experience work for you.
Throughout the years our office has represented thousands of people injured in automobile accidents.  Taking personal care of all our clients, we have amassed a solid settlement and verdict history.  Not only have we settled hundreds of cases for six and seven figure amounts, but we have received dozens of jury verdicts in that range as well.  In fact, our office has never lost a jury verdict wherein the matter in controversy exceeded $500,000.00.
Medical Malpractice
Medical professionals, health care providers, and even hospitals are capable of making mistakes that adversely affect your health. Despite extensive training and the vast innovations in health care, medical providers can be negligent in administering care. You are entitled to file medical malpractice lawsuits when you have suffered an injury or illness due to physician or medical personnel negligence.
Injuries sustained from medical malpractice can be debilitating. The injury itself may severely diminish your quality and enjoyment of life. It can also create further medical expenses, lost wages, and impact your ability to earn money throughout your lifetime.
You may have been a victim of medical malpractice if you received delayed treatment for your condition, if you were misdiagnosed, if you discharged from care to soon, your medical provider failed to refer you to a specialist, or they used faulty equipment in treating you.
Determining if you have been a victim of medical malpractice can be very difficult. Our medical malpractice attorneys are committed to insuring you were treated with the level of professionalism we expect from our medical providers. We will investigate your claim of medical malpractice to get you the compensation you deserve.
If you believe you or a love one has been a victim medical malpractice, contact Sgro & Roger and let our experienced team help you through this difficult time.
Notable Cases
Our office had the privilege in representing a young lady against a large regional hospital for the negligent care it levied upon her during her birth. The jury found that all of our client’s severe and permanent injuries were caused by the negligence of the hospital and awarded her over $5 million in damages.   The verdict in this case is one of our firm’s shining moments.
Premise Liability/Slip and Falls
Property owners and others responsible for maintaining property have an obligation to ensure their premises are reasonably safe and free of potential hazards.  When a property owner, landlord or tenant is negligent in providing safe premises or warning of potential dangers, innocent people can sustain injuries. If you suffered a severe injury as a result of dangerous or inadequately maintained property, the premise liability attorneys at Sgro & Roger may be able to help pursue financial compensation on your behalf.  Common types of premise liability cases include:





Slip
Trip
Fall Accidents
Dog Bites
Animal Attacks




Hotel
Injuries
Casino Injuries
Restaurant Injuries




Elevator/Escalator
Accidents
Stairway Accidents
Swimming Pool Accidents
Slip And Falls





The individual or party in control of a property has a responsibility to warn of any hazards that may exist and take steps to repair potentially dangerous conditions. In Nevada, plaintiffs in premises liability cases must establish that the property owner knew or should have known a hazard existed.
Common factors in premises liability cases include:





Negligent Security
Inadequate LightingElectrocution
Loose Handrails or Guardrails




Defective Sidewalks
Wet or Icy Walkways
Construction Hazards
Inadequate Fencing




Inaccessible Emergency Exits
Inadequate Warning Signs
Dangerous Playground Equipment





Our premise liability lawyers at Sgro & Roger specialize in dangerous premise condition cases that result in severe injuries including:

Brain Injures
Broken Bones
 Spinal Cord Injuries
Burn Injuries
Loss of Limb Injuries

Because there are different regulations that apply to property owners, managers and occupants, it’s important to meet with an experienced premises liability attorney if you were hurt due to a dangerous premises condition.  If you believe you are severely injured as a result of a dangerous condition on a premise, please contact Sgro & Roger for your free case consultation. Our experienced premises liability attorneys are ready to listen to your story and guide you through the complex legal process.
Notable Cases
A few years back, our office obtained a slip and fall jury verdict against a large national corporation.  Through our aggressive trial practice, we were able to have a key defense employ admit to “punitive” facts in their business operations.  As a result, we obtained a jury verdict in excess of $6 million; a number which still stands as the largest slip and fall verdict in our state.
Workers’ Compensation
Workers’ compensation is a form of industrial insurance that provides wage replacement and medical benefits to employees that have been injured at work, or suffer from occupational illnesses. Occupational illnesses can include respiratory conditions, carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive motion injuries and the like.
The workers’ compensation claim process is full of legal complexities, rules and timelines, which can be frustrating and confusing. When an injured employee should be focusing on their recovery, these legal burdens can be an unwelcome distraction. Although employees are advised that they can go through the system on their own, they are dealing with insurance adjusters who know every single rule and regulation that applies to workers’ compensation.





Medical Treatment
Lost Wages
Vocational Rehabilitation




Permanent Partial Disability
Permanent Total Disability
Transportation Fees





If you have questions about your workers compensation claim in Nevada, please contact Sgro & Roger, so we can meet with you and discuss what services we can provide and how we can represent you in your claims process.
Catastrophic Injury
If you have been the victim of an injury that has left you with life changing injuries, it may be considered a catastrophic injury. These injuries can result from car accidents, medical malpractice, product defects, or premise liability. A catastrophic injury affects more than just the immediate victim, family and friends all share in the pain. It can leave you needing long-term medical care and therapy. It also can create a significant strain on your family, as you may become limited physically and financially. Many people who suffer a catastrophic injury will never be able to return to the careers they had before. These lost wages and lost independence can make the injury almost unbearable. Let the experience of Sgro & Roger help you receive the just compensation you deserve.
Notable Cases
In 2014, our office obtained the largest single person “injury” settlement in Nevada history.   Our office filed suit on behalf of a young man rendered severely mentally and physically disabled as the result of the negligence of some of Nevada’s largest corporations.  The settlement value exceeded $30 million.  This matter epitomizes the work our attorneys can perform when needed.  We litigated against nine other law firms, over 500 attorneys strong, during a 3 year period.  After almost 60 court hearings, more than 30 depositions, and on the brink of trial, we obtained the largest settlement in Nevada history; and our client deserved every penny.
Product Liability
When we make purchases, we make them with the assumption that what we’re buying is safe for its intended use. Unfortunately, due to defects in manufacturing or design, these products can pose a threat to you or your loved ones. A product may also cause injury by failing to provide a sufficient safety warning. Product manufacturers and retailers are held legally responsible to you for the injuries their products cause. If you have been injured as the result of a defective product, you may be entitled to compensation. At Sgro & Roger, we will work with you to insure you receive the compensation you deserve.
