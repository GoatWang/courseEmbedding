	SECURITIES ACT EXEMPTION APPLICABLE.




	Registration of the 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2022
	(the 

	New Notes

	) under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 

	Securities Act

	), is not required by reason of Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (

	Section 3(a)(10)

	). Section
	3(a)(10) provides an exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act for:


	...any security which is issued in
	exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests...where the terms and conditions of such issuance are approved, after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all persons to whom it is
	proposed to issue securities in such exchange shall have the right to appear, by any court... 


	The New Notes will be issued in
	connection with the restructuring of the debt of the Issuer, certain of the Guarantors (being Emeco Holdings Limited, Emeco Canada Limited, Emeco International Pty Limited, EHL Corporate Pty Limited, Emeco Parts Pty Limited and Enduro SpA) and Emeco
	(UK) Limited pursuant to a creditors scheme of arrangement (the 

	Scheme of Arrangement

	), pursuant to the Commonwealth of Australia

	Corporations Act 2001

	, as amended, if such Scheme of Arrangement is approved. See
	Exhibit T3E(1) for the scheme document setting forth the Scheme of Arrangement and the explanatory statement required by Australian law to accompany it setting out all information a Scheme Creditor would need to know in order to be able to properly
	consider whether to vote in favour of the Scheme of Arrangement (together, the 

	Scheme Document

	). The Issuer and Emeco Holdings Limited anticipate mailing the Scheme Document to the Scheme Creditors (as defined therein) shortly
	after this application has been filed. As set forth in more detail in the Scheme Document, Scheme Noteholders (as defined therein) who validly elect to do so will receive a package of New Notes and common equity securities issued by Emeco
	Holdings Limited in exchange for their Existing Notes if the Scheme of Arrangement is approved. If the Scheme Noteholders do not accept, they will receive cash as outlined in the Scheme Document.



	Analysis



	The issuance of the New Notes
	as part of the Scheme of Arrangement will satisfy the required elements of the Section 3(a)(10) exemption as follows:


	(i)


	The
	securities must be issued in exchange for securities, claims, or property interests.




	If the Scheme of Arrangement is approved,
	the New Notes will be issued together with the other elements of the scheme consideration (which are the common equity securities of Emeco Holdings Limited) in exchange for the claims of the Scheme Creditors.


	(ii)


	A court or authorized governmental entity must approve the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange.

	A meeting of the Scheme Noteholders will be held on December 13, 2016 for the purpose of voting
	on the Scheme of Arrangement (

	Scheme Meeting

	). The Scheme Meeting will be convened and held in accordance with orders made by the Federal Court of Australia New South Wales District Registry (the 

	Court

	) in
	Proceeding NSD1899 of 2016, in which Emeco Holdings Limited has sought (among other things) orders under the Commonwealth of Australia

	Corporations Act 2001

	for the convening of a meeting of Scheme Noteholders to consider (and if thought fit,
	agree) the Scheme of Arrangement. If the Scheme of Arrangement is agreed by the requisite majority of the Scheme Noteholders as required under the Commonwealth of Australia

	Corporations Act 2001

	at such Scheme Meeting, Emeco Holdings
	Limited will then proceed without further delay to a hearing to be held in the Court for the purpose of obtaining a final order of the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement (the 

	Fairness Hearing

	). The hearing is scheduled
	to take place on December 15, 2016. Emeco Holdings Limited will cause to be published notice of the Fairness Hearing in accordance with the Commonwealth of Australia

	Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000

	and in accordance with orders
	of the Court in relation to the proposed Scheme of Arrangement, which will provide 5 clear days notice of the date of the Fairness Hearing, published in

	The Australian

	newspaper (a newspaper in national circulation in
	Australia). At the Fairness Hearing, the Court will consider, among other things, the fairness (and in accordance with Australian practice, reasonableness) of the Scheme of Arrangement, including the issuance of the New Notes and other
	consideration in exchange for the Existing Notes. Any interested party, including Scheme Creditors, has the right to appear at the Fairness Hearing and to present evidence or testimony with respect to the fairness of the terms and conditions of the
	Scheme of Arrangement to Scheme Creditors (including the Scheme Noteholders).


	(iii) 


	The reviewing court or authorized
	governmental entity must find, before approving the transaction, that the terms and conditions of the exchange are fair to those to whom securities will be issued and be advised before the hearing that the issuer will rely on the Section 3(a)(10)
	exemption based on the courts or authorized governmental entitys approval of the transaction.




	The Scheme of
	Arrangement is subject to the approval of the Court at the hearing that is scheduled to take place on December 15, 2016. In the course of that hearing on December 15, 2016, Emeco Holdings Limited will inform the Court that the Issuer will rely
	on the Section 3(a)(10) exemption based on the Courts approval of the transaction. It is anticipated that the Court will consider the fairness (and in accordance with Australian practice, reasonableness) of the Scheme of Arrangement to
	the Scheme Creditors in the course of approving the Scheme of Arrangement and issue a final order for the approval of the Scheme of Arrangement.


	(iv)


	The court or authorized governmental entity must hold a hearing before approving the fairness of the terms and conditions of the
	transaction.




	Effectiveness of the Scheme of Arrangement is subject to the approval of the Court following the Fairness Hearing
	described above.


	(v)


	A governmental entity must be expressly authorized by law to hold the hearing, although it is not necessary
	that the law require the hearing.




	The Court is expressly authorized to hold the Fairness Hearing by section 411 of the
	Commonwealth of Australia

	Corporations Act 2001

	.


	(vi)


	The fairness hearing must be open to everyone to whom securities would
	be issued in the proposed exchange.




	All Scheme Creditors (and any other interested parties) will be entitled to appear at the
	Fairness Hearing and dissenting Scheme Creditors will have an opportunity to voice their objections. The Fairness Hearing will be held by the Court in open court.


	(vii)


	Adequate notice must be given to everyone to whom securities would be issued in the proposed exchange.




	Pertinent information, as provided in the Scheme Document, will be provided to relevant Scheme Creditors in such a manner as to ensure that
	such parties receive timely and effective notice. Notice of the Scheme Meeting, and the contents of the Scheme Document and other information to be provided to Scheme Creditors for the purposes of their participation in the Scheme Meeting, will
	be provided in accordance with the orders of the Court made at the hearing on November 2, 2016.


	(viii)


	There cannot be any improper
	impediments to the appearance at the hearing by those persons.




	There will be no impediments to the appearance of any Scheme
	Creditors (including Scheme Noteholders) at the Fairness Hearing.

	INDENTURE SECURITIES



	 




	ITEM 8.


	ANALYSIS OF INDENTURE PROVISIONS.




	The New Notes will be subject to the Indenture filed as
	Exhibit T3C hereto. The following is a general description of certain provisions of the Indenture, qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Indenture filed as Exhibit T3C. All capitalized and otherwise undefined terms shall have
	the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.


	 





	(A)




	Events of Defaults; Withholding of Notice.






	Events of Default



	Each of the following events is an Event of Default:


	(1) default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) the New Notes when the same becomes due and payable at
	maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise;


	(2) default in the payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any
	New Note when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;


	(3) default in the
	performance or breach of provisions related to the merger, consolidation or sale of assets, or the failure by the Issuer to comply with the covenants pertaining to repurchase at the option of holders upon a change of control or in connection with
	excess proceeds from the disposition of assets or excess cash;


	(4) Emeco Holdings Limited or any of its restricted
	subsidiaries defaults in the performance of or breaches any other covenant or agreement in the Indenture or under the New Notes (other than a default specified in (1), (2) or (3) above) or any of the related security documents and such default or
	breach continues for a period of 30 consecutive days after written notice by the Trustee or the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes;


	(5) with respect to (a) payment priority obligations or (b) any other indebtedness of Emeco Holdings Limited or any restricted
	subsidiary with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least US$25.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time), Emeco Holdings Limited or any of its restricted subsidiaries default in payment beyond any grace period or in
	observance or performance of any agreement or condition with respect to such indebtedness, the effect of which default is to cause, or to permit a holder of such indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder) to cause (regardless of
	whether notice is required) acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness, unless a waiver of such defaults has been obtained;


	(6) one or more final judgments or orders for payment in an aggregate amount exceeding US$25.0 million (or its foreign currency
	equivalent at the time) (in excess of amounts which insurance carriers have agreed to pay) are rendered against Emeco Holdings Limited or any restricted subsidiary and are not paid or discharged and there is a period of 60 consecutive days following
	entry of the final judgment or order during which a stay of enforcement is not in effect;


	(7) certain events involving
	involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or other similar proceedings of Emeco Holdings Limited or any significant subsidiary (or any group of restricted subsidiaries that as a whole would constitute a significant subsidiary) that remain
	undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days, or an order for relief is entered against Emeco Holdings Limited or any significant subsidiary (or any group of restricted subsidiaries that as a whole would constitute a significant
	subsidiary) under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law;


	(8) Emeco Holdings Limited or any
	significant subsidiary (or any group of restricted subsidiaries that as a whole would constitute a significant subsidiary) (a) commences a voluntary case under any bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or other similar law, or consents to the entry of
	an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, (b) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by an administrator, receiver, liquidator or similar official of Emeco Holdings Limited or any significant subsidiary (or any
	group of restricted subsidiaries that as a whole would constitute a significant subsidiary) for all or substantially all of the assets of Emeco Holdings Limited or any


	 


	12





	significant subsidiary (or any group of restricted subsidiaries that as a whole would constitute a significant subsidiary), (c) makes any resolution for winding-up or dissolution
	effective or (d) effects any general assignment for the benefit of creditors;


	(9) any Guarantor denies or
	disaffirms its obligations under its guarantee or, except as permitted by the Indenture, a guarantee is determined to be unenforceable or invalid or will for any reason cease to be in full force and effect; or


	(10) (i) any security interest created by the security documents ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by
	the Indenture or the security documents) with respect to collateral with an aggregate fair market value exceeding US$5.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time), or Emeco Holdings Limited or any significant subsidiary asserts that
	any collateral with an aggregate fair market value in exceeding US$5.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent at the time) is not subject to a valid, perfected security interest (in each applicable jurisdiction, except as permitted by the
	Indenture or the other security documents) and such Default continues for 30 days after the Issuer receives written notice from the Trustee or holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the New Notes; or (ii) Emeco Holdings
	Limited or any significant subsidiary repudiates its material obligations under a security document.



	Acceleration



	If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in (7) or (8) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, if a responsible
	officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Event of Default, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the New Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given
	by the holders), may, and the Trustee at the written direction of such holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the New Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration,
	such principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in (7) or (8) above occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the New
	Notes then outstanding shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder. The Trustee will promptly provide the security trustee with written notice of
	any declaration of acceleration.



	Withholding of Notice



	The Trustee may withhold notice of Default if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
	of the Trustee in good faith determine that withholding the notice is in the interest of the holders, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of or premium or interest on the New Notes


	 





	(B)




	Execution, Authentication and Delivery of the Securities under the Indenture and Application of Proceeds Thereof.





	On the issue date, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver up to US$360,000,000 of New Notes, accompanied by an officers certificate
	directing such authentication and containing a statement that all conditions precedent to the issuance of such New Notes have been complied with. From time to time thereafter, additional New Notes may be executed and delivered by the Issuer to the
	Trustee for authentication, accompanied by an opinion of counsel and an officers certificate directing such authentication and specifying the amount of New Notes to be authenticated, the applicable rate at which interest will accrue on such
	New Notes, the date on which the original issuance of such New Notes is to be authenticated, the date from which interest will begin to accrue, the date or dates on which interest and the principal on such New Notes will be payable, other terms
	relating to such New Notes and a statement that all conditions precedent to the issuance of such New Notes have been complied with. The Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver such New Notes to or upon the written order of the Issuer (as
	set forth in such officers certificate).


	The New Notes shall be executed by or on behalf of the Issuer by the manual or facsimile
	signature of an authorized officer of the Issuer. The Trustee may appoint one or more authenticating agents reasonably acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate the New Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent
	may authenticate New Notes whenever the Trustee may do so.


	 


	13





	There will be no proceeds from the initial issuance of the New Notes because the New Notes will
	be exchanged for the Existing Notes pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement.


	 





	(C)




	Release or Release and Substitution of Property Subject to Lien.





	The Issuer and the
	Guarantors will be entitled to the release of the liens over property and other assets constituting collateral securing the New Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances:


	(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of assets which are subject to such liens to a person that is not (either
	before or after giving effect to such transaction) a restricted subsidiary of Emeco Holdings Limited if the sale or other disposition does not violate the provisions of the Indenture related to limitations on sales of assets and subsidiary stock;


	(2) in part, if Emeco Holdings Limited designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance
	with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the capital stock of such unrestricted subsidiary;


	(3)
	upon repayment in full of the New Notes;


	(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of
	the Indenture;


	(5) in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the security documents;


	(6) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or the security documents; or


	(7) in accordance with the amendment provisions of the Indenture.


	A release of any portion of the collateral pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the security documents shall not be deemed to
	impair the security interest on the remaining collateral.


	The Issuer (or relevant Guarantor) will furnish to the Trustee (or its agent)
	and the security trustee, prior to each proposed release of collateral pursuant to the security documents and/or the Indenture, an officers certificate or opinion of counsel to the effect that all conditions to the release of such collateral
	have been complied with, unless such collateral is sold or pledged in the ordinary course of business to the extent such sale or pledge is not prohibited by the Indenture or the security documents (which collateral shall be deemed automatically
	released upon any such sale).


	 





	(D)




	Satisfaction and Discharge of the Indenture.





	The Indenture will be discharged and will
	cease to be of further effect as to all New Notes (except as to such matters which are to survive the termination of the Indenture), when:


	(1) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture, including all amounts owing to the
	Trustee;


	(2) either: (i) all New Notes that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed New Notes that have
	been replaced or paid and New Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or (ii) all New Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for
	cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
	Trustee as trust funds in trust solely (A) for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable U.S. Government Obligations, in amounts as will be
	sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the New Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of
	maturity or redemption;


	 


	14





	(3) in respect of (2)(ii) above, the deposit will not result in a breach or
	violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make
	the deposit required to effect such satisfaction and discharge and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other indebtedness, and in each case the granting of liens to secure such borrowings); and


	(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the New
	Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.


	The Issuer must deliver an officers certificate and an opinion of
	counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.


	 





	(E)




	Evidence of Compliance with Conditions and Covenants.





	The Issuer shall deliver to the
	Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an officers certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signer of its duties as an officer of the Issuer he would normally have knowledge of any Default and
	whether or not the signer knows of any Default that occurred during such period and if any specifying such Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposed to take with respect thereto. Such compliance shall be determined without

Description
Table of Contents


While the share of South America in the global market for probiotics is the smallest, estimated to be 12% in 2016, the region’s demand for these products is expected to post a healthy growth. Brazil forms the largest as well as the fastest growing regional market for probiotics in South America, with an estimated share of 52% in 2016 and a forecast CAGR of about 11% between 2017 and 2022. By segment, dietary supplements and functional foods & beverages constitute the two largest segments, which are also projected to be fast growing.
Probiotics is defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as live micro-organisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.
Prevention and cure of disorders, such as lactose intolerance and inflammatory bowel disease are some of the benefits offered by probiotics, with rising health-consciousness levels and wider access to probiotic dietary supplements being the major factors sustaining growth. The past decade has been witness to the launch of more than 500 food & beverage probiotic products that have garnered exceptional response in terms of acceptance. Some of the factors implicated in causes of digestive disorders, bloating and reduction in resistance to infections include poor and not-in-time diet, age and stress levels. Studies have revealed that consuming products enhanced with probiotics has been successful in moderating these conditions to a large extent.
Manufacturers and suppliers of functional foods, in particular, have gained wider margins because of the seal of approval granted to probiotics. However, the players would need to focus on product innovations in order to account for greater market share in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of probiotics. In fact, companies, such as Japan-based Yakult Honsha and Denmark-based CHR Hansen have been successful in developing patented strains of micro-organisms, with the claim of having effect on specific health conditions. In addition, a raft of probiotic ingredient suppliers has also demonstrated success in developing bespoke strains of micro-organisms capable of being incorporated into a range of food products.
