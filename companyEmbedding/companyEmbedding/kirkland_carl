History[edit]
According to the company history,[2] Kirkland's was founded by Carl Kirkland in 1966 in Jackson, Tennessee, when he began selling home accessories at low prices. Since then the chain has grown to over 400 stores and continues to expand.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Each year, Kirkland's hosts events and special promotions in benefit of Camp Charley, a camp for critically ill children in Scottsville, Kentucky.[4] Kirkland's past philanthropic projects also include participation in ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and the American Cancer Society Relay for Life, as well as promotion of a holiday-themed CD in benefit of Habitat for Humanity.[5]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2005, the company said quarterly profit fell, and it would restate prior period financial statements to reflect corrections to its lease-related accounting.[6]

WE BELIEVE THAT GREAT STYLE CAN COME AT A GREAT PRICE.


            In 1966, Kirkland's was co-founded by Carl Kirkland in Jackson, TN, with a single belief in mind: great style can come at a great price—always.
        
 
WE'RE IMMERSED IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LIVE AND WORK.

            We believe in providing customers with everything they need to create inspirational living spaces, but we also believe in living inspirational lives. We honor this commitment through long-standing partnerships with local and national community-oriented organizations.
            Read more about our community involvement
            . We're strongly rooted in Tennessee and Jackson is still home to a Sales Support and Distribution Center. Our headquarters is located in Brentwood, TN within the Maryland Farms business community. At all levels of the organization, team members use their talents to help create engaging backdrops for customers' everyday lives, whether it's through merchandising, marketing, planning, accounting, and much more.

HISTORY

            We're a one-of-a-kind home decor and gift retailer with more than 340 stores across 35 states. See how our story began and how you can help us turn the next page...
        
HOW WE STARTED
A small gift shop with a unique vision

            The retail industry is practically in Carl Kirkland's blood. The co-founder was raised in his family's clothing store in Union City, TN. At a young age, he was put in charge of the Boy Scout department and had his first hands-on experience merchandising. In 1966, Carl opened a franchised gift shop in Old Hickory Mall in Jackson, TN where he perfected his ability to find and merchandise stylish items at even more stylish prices. At about the same time, Carl's cousin, Robert Kirkland, did the same in Nashville, TN. Both men found success with their down-to-earth business model: offer customers trendy items at great prices. Then, keep new and unique products flowing into the store to please the customer with fresh ideas for her home.
        
HOW WE TRANSFORMED
From gift shop to home decor leader

            In the late 1970's the two men began traveling abroad to find one-of-a-kind items that weren't being sold in other decor and gift shops. During the years to come, Kirkland's evolved from a gift shop to a home decor retailer and moved away from being a mall-based operation. For most retailers this is a tough transition, but Kirkland's never strayed from the founders' mission to offer the latest styles at a great price, which has led to more than 40 years of success in the home decor and gift market. In 2005, Kirkland's detached from its mall roots and transitioned more than 200 stores out of their mall locations and into more accessible shopping centers. This has allowed Kirkland's to expand the size and mix of merchandise, making it easier for customers to purchase larger items for their homes, like lounges, couches, and vanity sets.
        
WHO WE ARE TODAY
A home decor leader that inspires

            In the words of Carl Kirkland, "The Kirkland's store you shop today has the same focus as the Kirkland's you began shopping over 49 years ago: great style and great value, together with an ability to surprise and delight in home decor and gifts." You can still expect to find treasures for your home, whether you visit Kirkland's online or in-store. The founders of Kirkland's established more than a successful business when they brought Kirkland's to life; they established a company that helps us express who we are, one inspirational item at a time, which is a vision that Kirkland's family of employees have helped make a reality for the past 40 plus years. With new stores opening every month, you can look forward to having a Kirkland's near you! If you're interested in being part of a rapidly growing team of creators, innovators, analysts, and more,

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

                                    Hello Everyone.
I have been away for awhile,due to illness. I am back and ready to get back to work. Living in Calgary,Alberta, and at this point in time we are in a state of emergency. Calgary and Area is pretty much flooded and 100,000 people have been evacuated. So far I am fortunate and am high and dry. I am working from home office which is good. I am so happy that so far, there has been no loss of life. People have rallied together to help each other and many of us  who are dry are inviting the flood victims into our  private homes. Where there is no room centres have been set up and volunteers are helping out. The army is here to rescue those who cannot be reached.

                                    I cannot recall in my life, ever have knowing a set of twins. Would you believe that in the past four months I have done wedding videos for three sets of twins. Not just twins, but identical twins. And I mean identical.
Adding to that, I took another booking for a wedding video today and for the second time in a month, I am doing a wedding video where the brides name is Samantha and the grooms name is Chris.

                                    Working From Home

A Little Effort Leads To A Wealth Of Success

What would you do if you no longer had to worry about money? Where would you go? How would you spend your time?

If you�re like most people, you rarely stop to think about these kinds of questions. Too busy caught up in the day-to-day rat race, you�ve forgotten the dreams you had for yourself and your loved ones . . . or at least put them on the back burner for �later.�

Meanwhile, your life is passing you by. Birthdays come and go. Days blend into weeks and months, with only the occasional vacation or major life change to mix things up.

You know there must be more to life, but you�re not sure where to even begin making a change.

Here�s a thought for you: what if you could work from home? http://www.lifestylebusinessonline.com

                                    Hi everyone. I have just joined whoswho so would like to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I am from Brisbane, Australia.I am a videographer specialising in weddings. I will of course take on any other event that a client wants videoed.
Filming and photography has been a hobby since as far back as 1968, but it has only been in the last 12 months that I have taken it up as a full time job. This was due to restructering at my last job that made my position surplus. Having worked in the electrical and electronics fields all my life, I thought that this was all I could do, then suddenly I realised - hey, i have a lifetime hobby that i enjoy and have learnt so much about - step outside the square you've been boxed up in all those years and do something different. If you wish to have a look at my website you will find it at www.alloccasionsvideos.com.au
