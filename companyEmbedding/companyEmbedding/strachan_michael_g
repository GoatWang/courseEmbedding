For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.Settlement Amount or Range: Below AverageNature of Complaint: INCIDENT LOCATION: RICHMOND, VA ///
PRACTITIONER COMMENTS: Patient experienced a pneumothorax after receiving trigger point injections; which is a risk of the procedureState: VirginiaLess 0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor.

  "Michael is        equally committed to helping everybody find new and simple ways to        maintain their health." 



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Meta—a new line of wellness products from the makers of 
      Metamucil—announces its partnership with Michael Strahan, co-host of 
      LIVE with Kelly and Michael, FOX NFL Sunday analyst, Good Morning 
      America special co-host, and 2014 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee for 
      the launch of its new suite of products. His shared passion for health 
      and understanding of the importance of making small, healthy changes to 
      get big rewards made Strahan the perfect choice for a spokesperson.
    

      As the brand spokesperson, Strahan will appear in print and television 
      advertising, public relations efforts and online properties, including 
      the brand’s new website: MetaWellness.com. The national campaign kicks 
      off in August.
    

      In addition to the Metamucil powder that Americans know and love, the 
      Meta line will introduce two brand new products:
    


        Meta Health Bars™ are fiber bars containing psyllium fiber—available 
        in Cinnamon Oatmeal Raisin and Cranberry Lemon Drizzle—that can help 
        lower cholesterol to promote heart health†, help satisfy 
        hunger as a healthy snack, and help promote digestive health.
      

        MetaBiotic™ is a 2-in-1 MultiHealth probiotic supplement containing 
        Bio-Active 12™ which helps maintain digestive balance and promote a 
        healthy immune system.*
      


      “Metamucil is an iconic brand, helping consumers for more than 80 years! 
      We’re thrilled to partner with Michael to usher in a new era for the 
      brand. We want to bring significant new innovation that offers 
      clinically proven benefits to all consumers and help them be their best 
      every day,” said Patrick Lockwood-Taylor, Vice President, General 
      Manager of North America Personal Health Care at P&G. “Michael is 
      equally committed to helping everybody find new and simple ways to 
      maintain their health.”
    

      Transitioning from professional athlete to morning show mainstay, 
      Strahan also knows about reinvention and is looking forward to helping 
      introduce Americans to the new Meta.
    

      “Staying healthy after stepping off the football field was harder than I 
      thought,” said Strahan. “My schedule became busier than ever. Now I look 
      for small, healthy things I can do every day and that includes using 
      Meta products. I am a believer in the brand, which is why I am excited 
      to partner with them and help other people realize maintaining their 
      health doesn’t have to be so hard.”
    

      The full Meta line of products will be available in the digestive 
      wellness aisle of major retailers nationwide beginning in mid-August.
    




            † Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 7 grams 
            of soluble fiber per day from psyllium husk, as in Meta Health 
            Bars, may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering 
            cholesterol. One Meta Health Bar has 1.8 grams of this soluble 
            fiber.
