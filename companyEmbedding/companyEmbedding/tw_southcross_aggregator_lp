Item 1.  Security and Issuer    The second paragraph of Item 1 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: “Southcross Holdings Borrower LP (“SHB”) owns of record 26,492,074 Common Units and all 17,105,875 Class B Convertible Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units that are outstanding.  SHB is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Southcross Holdings LP (“Holdings”).  Holdings, through its indirect ownership of SHB, controls the activities of SHB.  Southcross Holdings GP LLC (“Holdings GP”) is the general partner of Holdings and in such capacity, controls the activities of Holdings.  Holdings GP is managed by a board of directors (the “Holdings GP Board”) who have the power and authority to manage and control the business and affairs of Holdings GP, including its control of the activities of Holdings.”  The fifth paragraph of Item 1 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following sentence as the last sentence of such paragraph:  “The Issuer subsequently determined to issue such Class B Convertible Units and issued the 279,303 Class B Convertible Units on May 9, 2016.”   Item 2.  Identity and Background    The first paragraph of Item 2(c) of the Original Schedule 13D (the paragraph immediately following “The principal business of each of the Filing Parties is as follows:”) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  “Aggregator owns 33.3% of Holdings and 33.3% of Holdings GP.  Aggregator also owns 48.86% of the limited partnership interests in BBTS Holdings LP (f/k/a BlackBrush TexStar LP), a Delaware limited partnership (“BBTS-LP”), and BBTS GP LLC (f/k/a BlackBrush TexStar GP LLC), a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of BBTS-LP.”  The last paragraph of Item 2 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  “Pursuant to the Plan (as defined below), EIG and Aggregator each own 33.33% of each of Holdings GP and Holdings and the Lenders own 33.34% of each of Holdings GP and Holdings.  As a result of the relationship of the Filing Parties, the EIG Parties and the Lenders among themselves, each of such parties may have been or continue to be members of a group under Rule 13d-5(b) with respect to the Common Units reported as beneficially owned by the Filing Parties in this Schedule 13D, although the Filing Parties do not affirm that, notwithstanding that such a group may have initially existed as of the closing of such transactions giving rise to the acquisition of beneficial ownership of such Common Units, such group is deemed to continue from and after such closing.”   Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration    The fourth paragraph of Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:   “On November 5, 2014, February 9, 2015, May 8, 2015, August 10, 2015, November 9, 2015, May 9, 2016, August 10, 2016 and November 14, 2016, Holdings received 256,078, 260,558, 265,118, 269,758, 274,478, 284,191, 289,165 and 294,226, respectively, Class B PIK Units from the Issuer as distributions on the Class B Convertible Units pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement.  SHB was entitled to receive from the Issuer, within forty-five (45) days after the quarter ending December 31, 2015, a Class B Quarterly Distribution (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), consisting of a payment-in-kind distribution on outstanding Class B Convertible Units of additional Class B Convertible Units (the “Class B PIK Units”), in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.   However, the Issuer did not timely make such Class B Quarterly Distribution.  The Partnership Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the Issuer’s failure to make such Class B Quarterly Distribution, the holders entitled to the unpaid Class B PIK Units shall be entitled (i) to Class B Quarterly Distributions in subsequent quarters on such unpaid Class B PIK Units and (ii) to all other rights under the Partnership Agreement as if such unpaid Class B PIK Units had in fact been distributed on the date due (“Unpaid Class B PIK Rights”).  On February 14, 2016, SHB acquired Unpaid Class B PIK Rights equivalent to 279,303 Class B Convertible Units. The Issuer subsequently determined to issue such Class B Convertible Units and issued the 279,303 Class B Convertible Units on May 9, 2016.  As of December 29, 2016, Holdings had received a total of 2,472,875 Class B PIK Units from the Issuer as distributions on the Class B Convertible Units.”  Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding a new paragraph between the sixth and seventh paragraphs of Item 3, which reads in its entirety as follows:  “On December 29, 2016, the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below), and certain lenders party thereto entered into that certain Waiver and Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to that certain Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2014, among the Issuer, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Bank PLC, as co-syndication agents, and a syndicate of lenders (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”).On December 29, 2016, in connection with the Fifth Amendment, Holdings contributed from cash on hand $17,000,000 pursuant to, and on the terms described in, the Equity Cure Agreement (as defined and described in Item 6), as amended by the First Amendment to Equity Cure Contribution Agreement, dated as of December 29, 2016 (as amended, the “Equity Cure Agreement”).  As of December 29, 2016, the Equity Cure Agreement is terminated pursuant to the Investment Agreement (as defined below).”   Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction    The second paragraph of Item 4(a) of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby deleted in its entirety.  Item 4(a) of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby further amended by adding the following paragraphs to the end of Item 4(a):  “Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, until such time as the Issuer’s Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) is less than 5.00 to 1.00, the Issuer is restricted from making cash distributions to the unitholders.  On December 29, 2016, in connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, Holdings entered into (a) an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with the Issuer and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (b) a Backstop Investment Commitment Letter (the “Backstop Agreement”) with the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and certain direct and indirect owners of Holdings party thereto (each, a “Sponsor” and, collectively, the “Sponsors”) and (c) a First Amendment to the Equity Cure Agreement with the Issuer.  In connection with entering into the Investment Agreement, the Equity Cure Agreement terminated and Holdings has agreed to contribute up to an additional $15.0 million in the aggregate to the Issuer (the “Committed Amount”) upon the earlier to occur of December 31, 2017, notification from the Issuer of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement or certain other events specified in the Investment Agreement.  In exchange for the amounts contributed pursuant to the Investment Agreement upon a Partial Investment Trigger or the Full Investment Trigger (as defined in the Investment Agreement), the Issuer will issue to Holdings, at Holdings’ election, either (a) a number of Common Units at an issue price equal to either (i) if the Common Units are listed on a national stock exchange, 93% of the volume weighted average price of such Common Units for the twenty day period immediately preceding the date of the contribution or (ii) if the Common Units are not listed on a national stock exchange, the fair market value of such Common Units as reasonably agreed by the Issuer and Holdings or (b) a senior unsecured note of the Issuer in an initial face amount equal to the amount of the contribution by Holdings, as described in the Investment Agreement (the “Investment Note”).   Pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, if, and only if, Holdings is unable to satisfy its funding obligations under the Investment Agreement with cash on hand upon the occurrence of a Partial Investment Trigger or a Full Investment Trigger, the Sponsors have agreed, severally and not jointly, to fund Holdings’ shortfall in providing the Committed Amount by contributing each Sponsor’s respective pro-rata portion of the shortfall to Holdings or, at the election of each Sponsor, directly to the Issuer. As consideration for any amounts contributed directly to the Issuer by a Sponsor pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, the Issuer will issue to such Sponsor the Common Units or Investment Note that would have otherwise been issued to Holdings under the Investment Agreement with respect to the amount contributed by such Sponsor.”  Item 4(b) of the Original Schedule 13D  is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  “SHB acquired 2,116,400 of the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units as part of the consideration for SXE to acquire TexStar’s Rich Gas System through the Drop-Down Contribution as described in Item 3 of this Schedule 13D and to establish a structure for common ownership and control of the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units through Holdings, as a new holding company of SXE, and its general partner Holdings GP, both of which are owned by EIG, Aggregator and the Lenders (as defined in Item 1(g) below). SHB acquired an additional 4,500,000 Common Units as part of the consideration for SXE to acquire certain assets through the Holdings Drop-Down Contribution.  SHB acquired an additional 2,472,875 Class B PIK Units as distributions on the Class B Convertible Units, as described in Item 3 of this Schedule 13D. SHB acquired an additional 8,389,188 Common Units pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement as an equity cure, as further described in Item 3 and Item 6.  SHB acquired an additional 11,486,486 Common Units in connection with the Fifth Amendment and pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement, as further described in Item 3 and Item 6. As a result of the relationship of Aggregator to Holdings and Holdings GP, and the relationship of the Filing Parties among themselves, as described in Item 2 and Item 5 of this Schedule 13D, each of the Filing Parties may be deemed to have shared power to vote, or direct the disposition of, and to dispose, or direct the disposition of, the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units held of record by SHB.”  Item 4(d) of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  “As of January 1, 2017, Andrew A. Cameron was elected as a director of the Board of the SXE GP.  As of January 6, 2017, the Board of SXE GP elected Bruce A. Williamson as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Williamson succeeded John E. Bonn, who stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer of SXE GP, and David W. Biegler, the former Chairman of the General Partner.  Mr.  Biegler is continuing as a director of SXE GP.”   Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer    Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  “(a and b) As of January 12, 2017, 48,516,567 Common Units, 17,105,875 Class B Convertible Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units are outstanding.  The Class B Convertible Units convert into Common Units at the Class B Conversion Rate on the Class B Conversion Date; the initial Class B Conversion Rate is 1.0 (i.e., one Common Unit for each Class B Convertible Unit). The Subordinated Units convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis on the expiration of the Subordination Period. Because such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units were acquired in connection with transactions having the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of SXE, such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units are considered converted for purposes of the calculations of the amounts noted under Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result of the relationship of the Filing Parties to SHB, each of the Filing Parties is deemed to be the beneficial owner, with shared power to vote or direct the vote and shared power to dispose or direct the disposition, of 55,811,662 Common Units, which constitutes approximately 71.7% of the outstanding Common Units (giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units).   SHB was entitled to receive from the Issuer, within forty-five (45) days after the quarter ending December 31, 2015, a Class B Quarterly Distribution (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), consisting of a payment-in-kind distribution on outstanding Class B Convertible Units of Class B PIK Units, in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. However, the Issuer did not timely make such Class B Quarterly Distribution.

The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreements, copies of which are Exhibits to this Schedule 13D and incorporated by reference herein.
