VBI Vaccines Announces Positive Interim Data from Phase 1 Study of Preventative CMV Vaccine
Well tolerated at all doses with no safety signals100% seroconversion at highest dose after two of the three planned vaccinationsDose-dependent antibody responses against CMV gB antigenFull data after third dose expected first half of 2018Conference Call and Webcast: Thursday, July 27, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. EDT


CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS--(Marketwired - July 27, 2017) - VBI Vaccines Inc. (NASDAQ:VBIV)(TSX:VBV) (VBI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing next-generation infectious disease and immuno-oncology vaccines, today announced positive results from a planned, interim data read-out from a Phase 1 study of its preventative cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine.
This interim data read-out analyzed safety data through day 84 of the study and initial immunogenicity signals in participant samples collected one month after the second of three planned vaccine doses:

Safety: The vaccine was well tolerated at all doses, with no safety signals.


Immunogenicity:

The vaccine induced antibody responses against the CMV glycoprotein B (gB) antigen with clear evidence of dose-dependent boosting after the second vaccination.
                Immunization with the highest dose of the vaccine induced seroconversion in 100% of subjects after just two vaccinations.
                After two of the three planned vaccinations, neutralizing antibodies against epithelial cell infection were demonstrated in 17% of subjects who received the highest dose of VBI-1501A.
                The highest dose of VBI-1501A (2.0mcg of gB-G content with alum) has approximately 10-fold less antigen content than that used in several other VLP-based vaccines or in past CMV vaccine candidates.
                Formulation of the vaccine with alum enhanced antibody titers.



"This pre-planned interim read-out has provided us with an excellent early look at the safety and immunogenicity of our CMV vaccine candidate," said Jeff Baxter, president and CEO of VBI. "The safety and tolerability data is critical, as this is the first-in-humans clinical study with a candidate generated from our enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP) technology. Moreover, we saw 100% seroconversion in subjects who received the highest dose of VBI-1501A, a dose-dependent boosting response, and development of neutralizing antibodies in some patients after two doses, providing us with confidence at this point that our vaccine is working as we intended. We look forward to seeing the final three-dose data in the first half of 2018." 
Joanne Langley, MD, professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Disease at Dalhousie University and principal investigator of the study, commented, "we are encouraged by this interim data, which provide early evidence that VBI's eVLP CMV candidate has the potential to safely and effectively induce seroconversion and elicit neutralizing antibody titers."
David Anderson, Ph.D., VBI Chief Scientific Officer, further commented, "induction of neutralizing antibodies that prevent epithelial cell infection has been a challenge for past CMV vaccines. The fact that we observe neutralizing activity against epithelial cell infection after just two doses is promising."
About the Phase I Clinical Study
This study is a Phase I randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VBI's preventative CMV vaccine in healthy adults. The study enrolled 128 CMV-negative subjects, aged 18-40 years, who were randomized into five arms to receive various dose levels of a modified form of gB, gB-G, with or without the adjuvant alum, or placebo:

0.5mcg of gB-G content with alum (VBI-1501A 0.5mcg)
            1.0mcg of gB-G content with alum (VBI-1501A 1.0mcg)
            1.0mcg of gB-G content without alum (VBI-1501 1.0mcg)
            2.0mcg of gB-G content with alum (VBI-1501A 2.0mcg)
            Placebo 

Patients were vaccinated at zero, two, and six months. VBI reported that all patients had received the third and final vaccination in May 2017. Final safety data through day 336 of the study and final immunogenicity data based on subject samples collected after the third vaccination is expected in the first half of 2018. 
Additional information, including a detailed description of the study design, eligibility criteria, and investigator sites, is available at ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT02826798.
Conference Call and Webcast Details
VBI Vaccines will host a conference call and webcast with accompanying slides on Thursday, July 27, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. EDT, to provide a clinical update on VBI-1501A, its preventative CMV vaccine.

About CMV
CMV can cause serious disease in newborns when a mother is infected during pregnancy. Each year, approximately 5,000 U.S. infants will develop permanent problems due to CMV, which can include deafness, blindness, and developmental delays. CMV affects more live births than Down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome, making it a key public health priority and a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination and reimbursement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  Overview  Levon Merger  On July 9, 2015, Levon Resources Ltd. ("Levon") completed a plan of arrangement (the "Levon Merger") pursuant to which SciVac Ltd. ("SciVac"), an Israel based company, completed a reverse takeover of Levon. Levon changed its name from Levon Resources Ltd. to SciVac Therapeutics Inc. Other than approximately CAD $27 million in cash retained by Levon, all other assets and liabilities of Levon were transferred or assumed by 1027949 BC Ltd., Levon's wholly owned subsidiary ("BC Ltd."). Additionally, upon consummation of the Levon Merger, each Levon shareholder received 0.5 common shares of BC Ltd., resulting in the Levon shareholders holding 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BC Ltd; therefore, the Company no longer owns any equity interest in BC Ltd.  VBI- SciVac Merger  On October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to acquire VBI DE by way of a merger transaction.  On May 6, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of VBI DE, pursuant to which Seniccav Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SciVac, merged with and into VBI DE, with VBI DE continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SciVac (the "VBI-SciVac Merger"). Upon completion of the VBI-SciVac Merger, SciVac changed its name to "VBI Vaccines Inc." and received approval for the listing of its common shares on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The common shares began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of trading on May 9, 2016 under the Company's new name and the ticker symbol, VBIV. Prior to the VBI-SciVac Merger, the Company's common shares were also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") under the symbol "VAC". Following the Effective Time of the VBI-SciVac Merger, the common shares began to trade on the TSX under the new symbol, "VBV".  VBI is a commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immuno-oncology. We currently manufacture our product, Sci-B-Vac(TM), a third generation Hepatitis B ("HBV") vaccine for adults, children and newborns, which is approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries. Sci-B-Vac(TM), but has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") or the European Medicines Agency (the "EMA"). The Sci-B-Vac(TM) vaccine has demonstrated safety and efficacy in over 300,000 patients in currently licensed markets. Several clinical trials have shown more rapid and higher rates of seroprotection with Sci-B-Vac(TM) than with GlaxoSmithKline's Engerix-B(R). Engerix-B(R) is one of the standards of care to prevent hepatitis B infection globally. VBI is nearing the completion of a Phase IV clinical study in Israel. The purpose of this study was to confirm a new in-house reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes. VBI is currently developing a clinical program to obtain FDA and EMA market approvals for commercial sale of Sci-B-Vac(TM) in the United States and the European Union (the "EU"), respectively. VBI recently received positive scientific advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") of the EMA regarding the Company's development path for its Sci-B-Vac(TM) vaccine in Europe. In its letter, the CHMP expressed its support of VBI's proposed plan to proceed to the Phase III clinical studies of Sci-B-Vac(TM). The CHMP also agreed that the product information, as well as data from ongoing studies, supports the Phase III clinical studies and VBI's planned filing of a market authorization application ("MAA") for Sci-B-Vac(TM). Our wholly-owned subsidiary in Rehovot, Israel currently manufactures and sells Sci-B-Vac(TM).  As a result of our acquisition of VBI Vaccines (Delaware) Inc. ("VBI DE") on May 6, 2016 (see Background of VBI DE below), we are developing novel technologies that seek to enhance vaccine protection in large, underserved markets. These include an enveloped "Virus Like Particle" or "eVLP" vaccine platform that allows for the design of enveloped virus-like particle vaccines that closely mimic the target viruses. VBI is advancing a pipeline of eVLP vaccines, with lead programs in human cytomegalovirus ("CMV"), an infection that, while common, can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems, and is involved in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme ("GBM"), which is a form of brain cancer. In September 2016, the Company completed the enrollment and initial dosing of 128 participants in the Phase I clinical study to evaluate its preventative CMV vaccine candidate. The Phase I study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of VBI's CMV vaccine candidate in 128 healthy CMV-negative adults. The study will also measure levels of vaccine-induced CMV neutralizing antibodies that may prevent CMV infection. Preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of 2017.  The Company is also advancing its LPV(TM) Thermostability Platform, a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability, potency, and safety. We may also seek to in-license clinical-stage vaccines that we believe complement our product portfolio, in addition to technologies that may supplement our therapeutic vaccination efforts in immuno-oncology.  At present, the Company's operations are focused on:  ? Manufacturing and sale of Sci-B-Vac(TM) in territories where it is currently registered;  ? Continuing the Phase IV trial in Israel as described above;  ? Preparing for Sci-B-Vac(TM) clinical trials to support various marketing authorizations in the U.S., Canada and Europe;  ? Conducting human proof-of-concept clinical trials with our CMV vaccine candidate;  ? Continuing pre-clinical development of our GBM vaccine candidate;  ? Scaling-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval;  ? Continuing the research and development of our product candidates, including the exploration and development of new product candidates;  ? Providing contracted services, primarily to customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;  ? Adding operational, financial and management information systems and human resources support, including additional personnel to support our vaccine development;  ? Maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio.  VBI's income generating activities have been from sales of its Sci-B-Vac(TM) product in markets that have generated a limited number of sales to-date as well as fees from R&D services. VBI has also incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception. As of December 31, 2016, VBI had an accumulated deficit of approximately $105.0 million and stockholders' equity of approximately $83.7 million. Our ability to maintain our status as an operating company is dependent upon obtaining adequate cash to finance our clinical development, our administrative overhead and our research and development activities. We plan to finance future operations with a combination of existing cash reserves, proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, the issuance of additional debt, and revenues from potential collaborations, if any. There is no assurance the Company will manage to obtain these sources of financing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  We have incurred operating losses since inception, have not generated significant product sales revenue and have not achieved profitable operations. We incurred net losses of $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we continue the clinical development of the Sci-B-Vac(TM) product and CMV vaccine candidate as well as advance our pre-clinical-stage product candidate, GBM. These include expenses related to:  ? Conducting human proof-of-concept clinical trials including the continuation of the CMV Phase I clinical trial, a planned GBM Phase I clinical trial and preparation for a Sci-B-Vac(TM) Phase III trial will require significant financial resources;  ? continuing the research and development of our product candidates;  ? scaling-up manufacturing capabilities through sub-contractors to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval;  ? maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio;  ? hiring additional clinical, manufacturing, and scientific personnel or contractors; and  ? adding operational, financial and management information systems and human resources support, including additional personnel, to support our vaccine development.  In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses as a public company, which subjects us to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Capital Market.  In 2016, we raised $24.1 million in equity and $15.0 million in debt financing to support our Sci-B-Vac(TM), CMV and GBM vaccine program, to continue the advancement of our research programs and for other general corporate purposes. Based upon our current cash position and by monitoring our discretionary expenditures as well as the careful management of our clinical trial commitments and operating costs, we believe these proceeds will be sufficient to fund our activities, including our approved capital expenditure requirements, into 2018. We expect, however, that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical, regulatory, R&D, sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our Sci-B-Vac(TM) and new vaccine candidates.  Since inception, VBI and its subsidiaries collectively have raised approximately $124.7 million in total equity and debt financing to support clinical and research development and general business operations.  R&D Services  Pursuant to an agreement with the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel, the Company is required to make services available for the biotechnology industry in Israel. These services include relevant activities for development and manufacturing of therapeutic proteins according to international standards and cGMP quality level suitable for toxicological studies in animals and clinical studies (Phase I & II) in humans. Service activities include analytics/bio analytics methods for development and process development of therapeutic proteins starting with a lead candidate clone through the upstream, purification, formulation and filling processes and manufacturing for Phase I & II clinical trials.  These R&D services are primarily marketed to the Israeli research community in academia and Israeli biotechnology companies in the life sciences lacking the infrastructure or experience in the development and production of therapeutic proteins in the standards and quality required for clinical trials for human use. In 2016 and 2015 the Company provided services to more than 10 biotech companies including analytical development, upstream development process, protein purification and formulation and filling for Phase I clinical studies.  VBI Cda also provides some R&D services pursuant to a research agreement and certain governmental research and development grants.  Financial Overview  Overall Performance  The Company had net losses of approximately $23.2 and $26.2 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $105.0 as December 31, 2016. The Company had $32.3 of cash at December 31, 2016 and net working capital of approximately $26.7.  Research and Development Expenses  Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our CMV vaccine, which include:  ? the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and other consumables and lab supplies used in our pre-clinical studies  ? expenses incurred under agreements with contractors or Contract Manufacturing Organizations to advance the CMV vaccine into clinical trials; and  ? employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense.  We expense research and development costs when we incur them.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel and consultants, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, patent protection, consulting and accounting services, travel and conference fees, including board and scientific advisory board meeting costs, rent, maintenance of facilities, depreciation, office supplies and expenses, insurance and other general expenses. General and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred.  We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of adding employees and scaling our operations commensurate with advancing a clinical candidate and continuing to support a public company infrastructure. These increases will likely include increased costs for insurance, hiring of additional personnel, board committees, outside consultants, investor relations, lawyers and accountants, among other expenses.  Interest Income  Interest income consists principally of interest income earned on cash balances and on R&D tax refunds.  Interest Expense  Interest expense is associated with our previously outstanding convertible notes and the credit facility entered into on July 25, 2014 and subsequently amended on December 6, 2016.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015  All amounts stated below are in thousands, unless otherwise indicated.  Revenues  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $548, as compared to $955 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The revenue decreased by $407, or 42.6%, largely as a result of the partial shutdown of production during the first quarter of 2016 for maintenance and construction as well as the subsequent slower ramp-up of revenues and the reduction of the number of larger service contacts in 2016 compared to 2015. These reductions were partially offset by $220 of collaboration revenue generated through VBI DE since the VBI-SciVac Merger.  Revenue by Geographic Region 2016 2015 $ Change % Change $ $ Revenue in Israel $ 320 $ 534 $ (214 ) (40 %) Revenue in Asia 4 8 (4 ) (50 %) Revenue in Europe 224 413 (189 ) (46 %) Total Revenue $ 548 $ 955 (407 ) (43 %)  Revenue earned in Israel for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $320 as compared to $534 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The revenue earned in Israel decreased by $214 or 40% primarily as a result of a reduction in the production of Sci-B-VacTM due to the partial closure during the year for maintenance and upgrades. Manufacturing was fully restored during the second quarter of 2016.  Revenue earned in Asia for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were insignificant.  Revenue earned in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $224 as compared to $413 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although there was some research service-related revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016, there was significantly more services revenue earned in Europe during the year ended December 31, 2015 from the completion of two large service projects.  Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,671 as compared to $3,753 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the cost of revenues of $82, or 2.2%, was a result of a decrease of production activities as a result of a partial shutdown of the manufacturing facility for maintenance and upgrades during the first half of 2016 which was offset by a provision of approximately $341 for inventory which largely related to some excess raw materials in inventory which are no longer expected to be used in the manufacturing process.  Research and Development  Research and development ("R&D") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $9,966 as compared to $14,123 for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred $13,505 in costs related to the acquisition of DNASE technology. This one-time cost was not repeated during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the decrease in the cost of R&D due to the non-recurrence of the technology acquisition was largely offset by the R&D expenses incurred by VBI DE since the VBI-SciVac Merger in the amount of $2.3 million. These costs included fees paid to CROs and other contractors in support of the trials as well as R&D salaries, contractors, consumables, license and patent related fees and well as a $637 share-based compensation expense related to the issuance of options and restricted shares.  General and Administrative  General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $11,761 as compared to $6,838 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The G&A expense increase of $4,923 or 72%, was primarily a result of an additional $3,694 in operating costs incurred by VBI DE since the VBI-SciVac Merger. These costs included salaries, facilities related costs, administrative, legal and professional fees. In addition, subsequent to the VBI-SciVac Merger there was share-based compensation expense of $2,521 related to the issuance of options and restricted shares compared to $2,127 for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to advisory services received in connection with the Levon merger. In addition, during 2016 there were additional professional and transaction related costs incurred by the Company related to the VBI-SciVac Merger which were partially offset by the non-recurrence of professional and transaction fees arising from the Levon Merger that closed July 9, 2015.  Net Loss from Operations  The net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $24,850 as compared to $23,759 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1,091 increase in the net loss from operations resulted from the increased R&D and G&A costs resulting from the VBI-SciVac Merger, largely offset by the non-recurrence of $13,505 in costs related to the DNASE technology that were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, discussed above.  Interest Expense, net  The interest expense decrease of $781 is a result of the deemed interest of certain previously outstanding related party loans that were held in SciVac prior to the Levon Merger (these loans and capital notes were exchanged for common shares of the Company as part of the Levon Merger). This decrease was partially offset by $392 of interest recorded in 2016 related to the long-term loan. In 2016, the interest expense relates to the interest on the debt facility that was assumed upon the VBI-SciVac Merger and the interest on the debt facility received in December 2016. The interest paid on long-term debt during the year-ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $283 and $0, respectively. The Company also accreted $109 of non-cash interest expense related to the debt discount during 2016.  Foreign Exchange Loss (Gain)  The foreign exchange gain of $189 as compared to a foreign exchange loss in the 2015 period of $1,458, is the result of the fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Canadian dollar ("CAD") and the New Israeli Shekel ("NIS") as compared to the U.S. dollar.  Income tax benefit  The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,780 as compared to $129 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The tax benefit recognized in 2016 related to the deferred taxes recorded for the increase in net operating loss carry forwards in the acquired Company subsequent to the VBI-SciVac Merger. In 2015, the income tax benefit recognized related to the deemed interest expense on the related party loans.  Net Loss  The net loss decreased by $2,988 or 11.4%, from $26,193 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $23,205 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in our net loss is mainly attributable to the decrease in our loss from operations and the increase in the income tax benefit, discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 $ Change % Change $ $ Cash $ 32,282 $ 12,476 $ 19,806 158.8 % Current Assets 34,358 14,522 19,836 136.6 % Current Liabilities 7,614 2,929 4,685 160.0 % Working Capital 26,744 11,593 15,151 130.7 % Accumulated Deficit (104,980 ) (81,775 ) (23,205 ) (28.4 %)  As at December 31, 2016, we had cash of $32,282 as compared to $12,476 as at December 31, 2015. As at December 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $26,744 as compared to working capital of $11,593 at December 31, 2015. Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets.  We expect, that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical, regulatory, R&D, sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our Sci-B-Vac(TM) and new vaccine candidates. We base this belief on assumptions that are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. The Company expects a need to raise additional funds in order to continue its ongoing development programs. The additional funds may be in the form of additional debt, equity or a combination of both and may require that additional warrants be issued.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  On June 20, 2016, the Company closed an equity private placement. Under the terms of the financing, the Company sold an aggregate of 3,269,688 of its common shares at a price of approximately $4.16 per share for total gross proceeds of approximately $13.7 million. As previously disclosed, the Company has and will continue to use the proceeds from the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the continued development of its growing vaccine pipeline. The securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be resold absent registration under or exemption from such Act. Contemporaneously with the December 2016 transaction discussed below, an additional 77,787 common shares were issued pursuant to an anti-dilution provision included in the share purchase agreement.  On December 6, 2016, we raised $10.6 million in an equity financing transaction with Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. and Titan-Perc Ltd. Under the terms of the equity financing, we sold an aggregate of 3,475,000 of our common shares at a price of $3.05 per share, for total gross proceeds of approximately $10.6 million. In a concurrent debt financing transaction with Perceptive Credit Holdings, LP ("Perceptive Credit"), we raised an additional $12.8 million net of $360 in deferring financing charges. Additionally, Perceptive Credit increased its current credit agreement with us by funding an additional $13.2 million in secured debt. In conjunction with the additional debt funding, we issued a 5-year warrant to Perceptive Credit for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,705,053 common shares. Up to 363,771 of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of $4.13 per share and up to 1,341,282 of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of $3.355 per share. We have and will continue to use the proceeds of the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the continued development of our growing vaccine pipeline.  Our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the progress and results of our clinical trials, the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our products, the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our products, product sales outside of Israel, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution.  The Company will require significant additional funds to conduct clinical and non-clinical trials, achieve regulatory approvals, and, subject to such approvals, commercially launch its products.  If adequate funds are not available, in order to continue operations the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.  We may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. Although we are pursuing different opportunities, other than as disclosed in this report, we currently do not have any signed commitments for future external funding. We may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable. The sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional equity . . .

Chronic Hepatitis B Infection





  





Hepatitis B is usually spread when blood, semen, or other body fluids from an HBV-infected person enter the body of someone who is not infected. HBV attacks the liver, causing both acute and chronic disease.
In its early stages, chronic hepatitis B infection is largely asymptomatic and many patients who may benefit from treatment go undiagnosed. Research has shown that treatment can have a major preventive effect on liver-related mortality and morbidity in persons with chronic hepatitis B infection. Efforts are needed to detect those infected who would benefit from treatment, so that the costly long-term side effects of hepatitis B can be better managed.
According to the World Health Organization (“WHO”), globally, 240 million people are chronically infected with HBV and more than 780,000 people die every year due to complications related to hepatitis B, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. In sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, 5-10% of the adult population suffers from chronic hepatitis B infection. High rates of chronic infections are also found in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.










Worldwide Rates of Chronic Hepatitis B





Source: U.S. CDC Department of Health and Human Services Publication, 2010






  







  



Sci-B-Vac™ Design





  



  





First and Second-Generation Hepatitis B Vaccines
First-generation plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccines were developed in the U.S. and France in the late 1970s. In the mid-1980s, second-generation recombinant DNA-based hepatitis B vaccines were constructed using yeasts transfected with DNA sequences coding for the HBV S antigen. These second-generation vaccines are currently used for universal vaccination efforts in many countries worldwide.












  





Sci-B-Vac™: A Third-Generation HBV Vaccine
In contrast to second-generation hepatitis B vaccines, which contain only one surface antigen (the S antigen), Sci-B-Vac™ contains the S antigen and the pre-S1 and pre-S2 surface antigens. The composition of Sci-B-Vac™ may provides more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies that can recognize one or more components of the hepatitis B virus.

Company Overview





  





VBI Vaccines Inc. (Nasdaq: VBIV) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a next generation of vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immuno-oncology. VBI’s first marketed product is Sci-B-Vac™, a hepatitis B (“HBV”) vaccine that mimics all three viral surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus; Sci-B-Vacis approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries. VBI’s eVLP Platform technology allows for the development of enveloped (“e”) virus-like particle (“VLP”) vaccines that closely mimic the target virus to elicit a potent immune response. VBI is advancing a pipeline of eVLP vaccines, with lead programs in cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) and glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”). VBI is also advancing its LPV™ Thermostability Platform, a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability, potency, and safety. VBI is headquartered in Cambridge, MA with research operations in Ottawa, Canada and research and manufacturing facilities in Rehovot, Israel.

Sci-B-Vac™





  





Sci-B-Vac is a third-generation licensed hepatitis B vaccine currently approved for use in Israel and in 14 other countries. Sci-B-Vac has demonstrated safety and efficacy in over 300,000 patients.
In contrast to some current hepatitis B vaccines, which contain only one surface antigen (the S antigen), Sci-B-Vac contains the S antigen and the pre-S1 and pre-S2 surface antigens. The composition of Sci-B-Vac may provide more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies that can recognize one or more components of the hepatitis B virus (“HBV”).
According to the World Health Organization (“WHO”), globally, 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B and more than 780,000 people die every year due to complications related to the virus, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Learn more about Sci-B-Vac >>
Sci-B-Vac Highlights




Mimics all three surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus.
Offers high levels of anti-HBV antibodies and rapid onset of protection.
Can be administered at lower doses than other currently available hepatitis B vaccines.
Free of next-generation adjuvants.
Produced in mammalian cells (CHO cells).








  





Sci-B-Vac










Competing Hepatitis B Vaccine










  



Countries that have approved Sci-B-Vac


Central Africa, Chile, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Georgia, Ghana, Hong Kong, Israel, Ivory Coast, Moldova, Niger, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, and Vietnam.







  







  



eVLP Platform





  





VBI’s eVLP Platform allows for the design of enveloped (“e”) virus-like particle (“VLP”) vaccines. eVLPs are designed to mimic the organization and conformation of viruses as they occur in nature, but without the viral genome, potentially yielding safer and more potent vaccine candidates.
Because of their structural similarity to viruses found in nature, vaccination with a target protein expressed in an eVLP is capable of imparting greater immunity than vaccination with the same recombinant target protein alone.1 Learn more >>
Platform Highlights




“Third-generation” virus-like particle vaccines closely mimic the structure of target viruses.
Potential preventative and therapeutic vaccine applications.
Lead program is a vaccine to prevent cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) infection with strong preclinical proof of concept.2
Exploring additional undisclosed eVLP candidates for development.
Strong intellectual property estate.










Video IntroductionKey Characteristics









Dr. David Anderson, VBI’s Chief Scientific Officer, discusses VBI’s unique approach to vaccine development.








Unlike first-generation and second-generation VLP approaches, which have yielded successful vaccines but can mean limited rational and flexible design potential, VBI’s eVLP Platform provides a stable foundation that mimics enveloped viruses and is suitable for a wide array of vaccine candidates.3




Platform Advantages






Highly Immunogenic: Immune responses comparable to or better than natural infection by closely mimicking structure of target virus.4
Customizable: Ability to rationally design a vaccine by including different antigens and controlling their relative expression.
Safe: Unlike live-attenuated vaccines, VLPs cannot revert back to an infectious state.
Commercially Viable: Manufactured and purified using scalable methods; demonstrated high yields and purity.5

CMV Vaccine Program





  





VBI is developing a prophylactic vaccine to prevent cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) infection. CMV is a leading cause of prenatal developmental delays. VBI has completed GMP manufacturing of its lead candidate for use in Phase I trials. VBI expects to evaluate safety, tolerability, and also immunological proof of concept in humans during Phase I trials by measuring CMV neutralizing antibodies in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Learn more about VBI’s CMV Vaccine Candidate >>

Market Need and Opportunity





CMV is a common virus that infects one in every two people in many developed countries.1 Most CMV infections are “silent,” meaning most people who are infected with CMV exhibit no signs or symptoms. However, CMV can cause serious disease in newborns when a mother is infected during pregnancy – this is known as congenital CMV infection.
Each year, approximately 5,000 U.S. infants will develop permanent problems due to CMV, some of them severe, including deafness, blindness, and mental retardation.2 CMV affects more live births than Down Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,3 making it a key public health priority and a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination among certain high-risk populations.4






  







  



LPV™ Platform





  





The LPV Platform is a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability, potency, and safety. Many vaccines and biologics are highly sensitive to temperature and physical stress, and many must be stored between 4° C and 8° C to preserve their integrity. Without proper storage, exposure to elevated or freezing temperatures can lead to a loss in potency or reduced safety, limiting protective benefits or therapeutic effects.1 Learn more >>
Platform Highlights




Long-lasting stability across a variety of conditions; demonstrated potency in multiple preclinical animal models, including non-human primates.2
Suitable for a variety of vaccines and biologics; has been used to preserve stability and potency of several classes of vaccine antigens, including protein-based, monoclonal antibodies, whole-inactivated, and live-attenuated vaccines and viral vectors.3
Successfully tested in a GMP-compliant production plant at pilot levels; data demonstrates product consistency across batches.4
Novel, fully synthetic lipid combinations with well-established safety profiles; lipids reduce protein aggregation and reduce other process-related (sheer) stresses.5










PartnershipsProof of ConceptStability and Thermostability



With its partners, VBI seeks to develop a next-generation of vaccines and biologics which preserve stability and allow for consistently safe and effective administration in both established and emerging markets. If you are interested in learning more about our LPV Platform, please contact us.
Collaborations of Note


  





VBI has entered into a research collaboration with GSK, a leading global healthcare company, to evaluate the LPV Platform. Learn more >>













  





VBI is working with Sanofi Pasteur to explore reformulating a Sanofi Pasteur vaccine candidate to improve stability. Learn more >>



















VBI has completed proof of concept studies on a number of vaccine and biologic targets that demonstrate the LPV Platform’s ability to preserve potency under stress conditions:




Proof of Concept Studies






Influenza: 12 months at 40° C6
Rabies: 18 months at 40° C7
MMR: 8 weeks at 37° C8
Herceptin®-like: 8 weeks at 40° C9






Vaccines and biologics vary greatly in their ability to remain viable during handling, storage, and administration. The stability of a particular vaccine formulation depends on many factors including the type of antigen (active ingredient) and the presence of other vaccine components such as adjuvants, stabilizers, and preservatives.
One factor that is known to affects characteristics of all vaccines over time is temperature. Without a constant temperature in a very narrow range above freezing, many vaccines lose their potency, become ineffective, or can become hazardous. Currently, more than 90% of all vaccines require shipment in a temperature controlled supply chain or “cold chain”.10
Reliance on a cold chain increases vaccine costs by up to 20%11 and is a significant barrier to patient access in many emerging markets. In addition to maintaining the cold chain, there is a separate challenge of verifying any lapses in the chain to ensure the viability of the vaccine before it is administered, particularly in poor or remote areas.

Zika Program Overview





  





VBI is applying its eVLP Platform in the development of a preventative Zika virus (“Zika”) vaccine candidate. Enveloped virus-like particle (“eVLP”) vaccines closely mimic the structure of viruses found in nature, but without the viral genome, potentially yielding safer and more potent vaccine candidates.
VBI is developing a bivalent Zika vaccine candidate consisting of E glycoprotein (found on the surface of Zika virus) and NS1 glycoprotein (secreted during Zika viral replication). Preclinical testing suggests that Zika eVLPs may present Zika target proteins in an optimal shape and conformation, potentially allowing for a potent immune response. VBI plans to conduct additional testing in animal models to validate its approach.

Zika Medical Need





  





Zika is a mosquito-borne virus, from the genus Flavivirus. Zika is spread primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito, but some evidence suggests that it may also be transmitted sexually or during childbirth.1
The first formal description of Zika virus was published in 19522 but interest in the virus was limited for many years. It was not until 2007 that the first Zika outbreak in humans was recorded.3 Over the past decade, Zika has begun to spread outside of tropical regions of Africa and Asia with serious resulting complications.4 Between January 2014 and February 2016, 33 countries reported circulation of the Zika virus. In February 2016, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (“PHEIC”), saying that the virus was “spreading explosively” in the Americas.
While the acute manifestations of Zika infection are typically mild, the disease has been associated with a number of neurological complications.5 There is scientific consensus that Zika can cause congenital microcephaly, a condition where a child is born with a smaller than expected head due to abnormal brain development. Zika may also cause Guillain-Barrė syndrome (“GBS”), a disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, leading to muscle weakness or, in severe cases, paralysis. There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika infection.

Design Approach





  





VBI is developing a bivalent Zika vaccine candidate consisting of a surface E glycoprotein and an internal NS1 glycoprotein. E glycoproteins are found on the surface of the Zika virus. NS1 glycoproteins are secreted during Zika viral replication and may generate a cytotoxic T cell response important for cellular immunity.
During recent testing, VBI used a cell entry assay to confirm the presence of E glycoproteins on the surface of its Zika eVLPs; the conformation was found to be suitable for receptor binding and cell entry. VBI is planning to conduct testing in animal models to help validate the immunogenicity and protective potential of its approach.
