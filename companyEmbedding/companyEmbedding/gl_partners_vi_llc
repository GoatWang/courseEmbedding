WHO WE AREWe aim to be the partner of choice for outstanding entrepreneurs
Peterson Partners is an independent investment management firm with assets under management across a variety of alternative asset classes.
The core of who we are is in our name: ‘Partners’. We seek to be a true value-add partner to the entrepreneurs we back, and we look for entrepreneurs who desire more than just capital from an investment partner.
For over 15 years, Peterson Partners has been partnering with exceptional entrepreneurs. We have invested in over 200 companies, primarily in the US, but also Canada, Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and India. 
We were founded by Joel Peterson, a teacher of entrepreneurs, a long-time backer of entrepreneurs, and an entrepreneur himself. After helping to build Trammell Crow Company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise, eventually as Managing Partner, Joel left to teach at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and founded Peterson Partners, with the mission of helping entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. Since then Peterson Partners has grown into a professional, independent investment management firm with funds allocated across several disciplines: Private Equity, Seed Stage Venture, Search Funds, and Real Estate. 
Each business has a differentiated strategy, but the foundation of each remains the same as those first investments – we seek to be a true partner to outstanding entrepreneurs.

Fire, then ice


The last 20 years have seen negative correlations between stock and bond prices. This is against the precedent of history: for the preceding 250 years the correlation was consistently positive.

Tequila Sunrise: Good news for the Mexican Peso


The Mexican Peso could currently make a good claim to be one of the most unloved assets in the world, with speculative shorts close to record highs. Here we discuss some structural reasons why the selloff might be overdone.
