New Options for Natural Product Engineering



Date
Friday, February 7, 2014 - 3:00 p.m. 

Location
  
                McDonnell Douglas Engineering Auditorium        

ChEMS Seminar
Prof. Blaine Pfeifer
	Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering
	The State University of New York at Buffalo
 
Using experience and insight gained from previous attempts at producing complex natural products through heterologous hosts, this presentation will describe new initiatives to access and evaluate the chemicals encoded by responsible genetic pathways.  The basis for the work presented is the production of compounds associated with the polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and isoprenoid classifications.  The heterologous production processes for these molecule types has presented challenges in metabolic engineering to provide precursor biosynthetic support, gene expression to account for the coordinated production of multiple enzymes dedicated to biosynthesis, and analytical chemistry to assess intermediate and final product levels.  Addressing each challenge is now positioning new technology to better access and test the capabilities of complex natural products by using heterologous biosynthesis.    
 
Bio: Dr. Pfeifer earned his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Colorado State University in 1997.  He earned M.S. degree in 1999 and Ph.D degree in 2002, both in Chemical Engineering, from Stanford University.  He is an Associate Professor in SUNNY-Buffalo since 2011.

About





























Henry Samueli



UCI’s engineering school was renamed The Henry Samueli School of Engineering in 1999 after Samueli, co-founder, chairman and chief technical officer of Broadcom Corp., made a generous donation.
Samueli, who earned bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from UCLA, began his career at TRW, Inc., where he was responsible for the development of military broadband communications systems. Later, he was chief scientist and co-founder of PairGain Technologies, Inc. a telecommunications equipment manufacturer.
In 1985, he joined the UCLA electrical engineering faculty, and in 1991, he co-founded semiconductor company Broadcom with his former student, Henry Nicholas. The company became publicly traded in 1998.
Samueli, who is also a distinguished adjunct professor in UCI’s electrical engineering and computer science department, has more than 30 years of experience in the fields of communications systems engineering and digital signal processing. He is a named inventor in 73 U.S. patents. In 2011, the Global Semiconductor Alliance named him the winner of the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award, and in 2012, he was awarded the Marconi Society Prize and Fellowship.
He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
With his wife, Susan, Samueli owns the Anaheim Ducks professional hockey team and is a well-known philanthropist. The Samueli Foundation supports a wide range of innovative, entrepreneurial and sustainable causes, including at-risk children, foster youth and other underserved populations locally and abroad.

Outreach





























Outreach









The Samueli School of Engineering faculty and staff strongly believe in the importance of a diverse student body to address the unprecedented challenges being faced in today’s globalized, technology-driven, knowledge-based economy.
The school manages various outreach programs, from teacher training and a variety of K-12 programs to a collaboration with local community colleges. Popular summer camps emphasize critical thinking, communication and problem solving and introduce middle school children to enabling technologies such as 3-D printing. The goal is to increase enthusiasm and interest in STEM majors, ensuring the next generation of problem solvers and a qualified workforce.
In addition to diversity and access, the school engages in STEM education reform efforts, connecting teachers and schools with subject matter experts to support Common Core implementation and Next Generation Science Standards. In this way, the school contributes to the national discourse and critical evaluation of how the country educates tomorrow’s innovators.
The school’s outreach extends beyond U.S. borders to form international collaborations. Global outreach opens the door to opportunities for faculty and students to exchange knowledge, learn about different cultures and expand horizons.

Education[edit]
Samueli's parents, Sala and Aron, were Polish Jewish immigrants who survived the Nazi occupation of Europe and arrived in the United States with almost nothing.[4] Samueli stocked shelves in his family's Los Angeles liquor store and graduated from Bancroft Junior High School and Fairfax High School.[4] Samueli became interested in electronics when he took a shop class at Bancroft.
Samueli attended UCLA, where he received his bachelor's degree (1975), master's degree (1976), and Ph.D (1980), all in the field of electrical engineering. His Ph.D. advisor was Alan N. Willson Jr. and his Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "Nonperiodic forced overflow oscillations in digital filters".
Broadcom origins[edit]
In 1991, while still working as a professor at UCLA, Samueli co-founded Broadcom with one of his former students, Henry Nicholas. Each invested $5,000 and worked out of Nicholas' Redondo Beach home, moving to Irvine four years later and taking the firm public three years after that.[4] In 1998, when Broadcom became a publicly traded company, Samueli stopped working as a professor, but the UCLA Department of Electrical Engineering still maintains his name on the list of faculty.[citation needed]
Anaheim Ducks ownership[edit]
In June 2005, he and his wife Susan bought the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim from the Walt Disney Company for $75 million. The deal also included Anaheim Arena Management, the company that operates the city-owned Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, the home of the Ducks. In 2006, Samueli announced he was changing the team's name to the Anaheim Ducks and the arena's name to the Honda Center. The Ducks were reportedly worth $188 million in 2011.[5] Under the ownership of Samueli and his wife Susan, the Ducks won the 2007 Stanley Cup championship.
In June 2008, the NHL indefinitely suspended Samueli as owner after he pleaded guilty to lying to U.S. securities regulators.[6] However, on November 12, 2009, National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman reinstated Henry Samueli as owner of the Anaheim Ducks, citing lack of evidence and his outstanding character.[7]
The case was ultimately dismissed on December 10, 2009, by U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney.[8]
In January 2015, Samueli, his wife and his daughter acquired ownership of the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. They subsequently moved the franchise to San Diego as part of the AHL's western expansion that year and the team was re-branded as the fourth incarnation of the San Diego Gulls.[9]
Other interests[edit]
Health and alternative medicine[edit]
Samueli and his wife established the Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine at UC Irvine, and the Samueli Institute for Information Biology in Washington, D.C. The controversial activities of both organizations reflect Susan Samueli's interest in homeopathy and alternative medicine.[10] They have also supported the research of the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, California in cancer prevention and treatment.[11]
Education[edit]




Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA


Before starting Broadcom, Henry Samueli worked in the department of engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, and he and his wife subsequently made major donations to the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and UC Irvine Henry Samueli School of Engineering, which have since been named after him. Samueli's donation founded the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library at Chapman University, which was dedicated in 2005.[4] The Foundation has also given grants to Tarbut V' Torah, Chapman University, the Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA), the Ocean Institute, El Viento, THINK Together, Orangewood’s Guardian Scholar Program, KOCE, the Discovery Science Center and Hope University.
Financial investigation[edit]
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Department of Justice had been investigating Broadcom Corporation for backdating of stock options.[12]
On May 15, 2008, Samueli resigned as Chairman of the Board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the SEC.[13]
On June 23, 2008, Samueli pleaded guilty for lying to SEC for $2.2 billion of backdating. Under the plea bargain, Samueli agreed to a sentence of five years probation, a $250,000 criminal fine, and a $12 million payment to the US Treasury.[14][15]
During the technology boom in the 2000s, Samueli and Broadcom co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III awarded millions of stock options to attract and reward employees. Prosecutors alleged Samueli and Nicholas granted options to others, including some other top executives but not themselves, to avoid having to report $2.2 billion in compensation costs to shareholders.[4]
Prosecutors focused on the fact that Samueli denied under oath any role in making options grants to high-ranking executives. As part of his plea agreement, Samueli admitted the statement was false, and admitting to being part of the options-granting process.[4] However, an internal Broadcom probe laid the majority of blame on Henry Nicholas and William Ruehle.
On September 8, 2008, U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney (a fellow UCLA alumnus) rejected a plea deal that called for Samueli to receive probation, writing: "The court cannot accept a plea agreement that gives the impression that justice is for sale".[16]
16 months later, on December 10, 2009, Judge Carney dismissed the case against Samueli, citing Samueli's testimony in another case as well as prosecutorial misconduct.[17]

Education[edit]
Samueli's parents, Sala and Aron, were Polish Jewish immigrants who survived the Nazi occupation of Europe and arrived in the United States with almost nothing.[4] Samueli stocked shelves in his family's Los Angeles liquor store and graduated from Bancroft Junior High School and Fairfax High School.[4] Samueli became interested in electronics when he took a shop class at Bancroft.
Samueli attended UCLA, where he received his bachelor's degree (1975), master's degree (1976), and Ph.D (1980), all in the field of electrical engineering. His Ph.D. advisor was Alan N. Willson Jr. and his Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "Nonperiodic forced overflow oscillations in digital filters".
Broadcom origins[edit]
In 1991, while still working as a professor at UCLA, Samueli co-founded Broadcom with one of his former students, Henry Nicholas. Each invested $5,000 and worked out of Nicholas' Redondo Beach home, moving to Irvine four years later and taking the firm public three years after that.[4] In 1998, when Broadcom became a publicly traded company, Samueli stopped working as a professor, but the UCLA Department of Electrical Engineering still maintains his name on the list of faculty.[citation needed]
Anaheim Ducks ownership[edit]
In June 2005, he and his wife Susan bought the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim from the Walt Disney Company for $75 million. The deal also included Anaheim Arena Management, the company that operates the city-owned Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, the home of the Ducks. In 2006, Samueli announced he was changing the team's name to the Anaheim Ducks and the arena's name to the Honda Center. The Ducks were reportedly worth $188 million in 2011.[5] Under the ownership of Samueli and his wife Susan, the Ducks won the 2007 Stanley Cup championship.
In June 2008, the NHL indefinitely suspended Samueli as owner after he pleaded guilty to lying to U.S. securities regulators.[6] However, on November 12, 2009, National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman reinstated Henry Samueli as owner of the Anaheim Ducks, citing lack of evidence and his outstanding character.[7]
The case was ultimately dismissed on December 10, 2009, by U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney.[8]
In January 2015, Samueli, his wife and his daughter acquired ownership of the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. They subsequently moved the franchise to San Diego as part of the AHL's western expansion that year and the team was re-branded as the fourth incarnation of the San Diego Gulls.[9]
Other interests[edit]
Health and alternative medicine[edit]
Samueli and his wife established the Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine at UC Irvine, and the Samueli Institute for Information Biology in Washington, D.C. The controversial activities of both organizations reflect Susan Samueli's interest in homeopathy and alternative medicine.[10] They have also supported the research of the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, California in cancer prevention and treatment.[11]
Education[edit]




Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA


Before starting Broadcom, Henry Samueli worked in the department of engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, and he and his wife subsequently made major donations to the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and UC Irvine Henry Samueli School of Engineering, which have since been named after him. Samueli's donation founded the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library at Chapman University, which was dedicated in 2005.[4] The Foundation has also given grants to Tarbut V' Torah, Chapman University, the Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA), the Ocean Institute, El Viento, THINK Together, Orangewood’s Guardian Scholar Program, KOCE, the Discovery Science Center and Hope University.
Financial investigation[edit]
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Department of Justice had been investigating Broadcom Corporation for backdating of stock options.[12]
On May 15, 2008, Samueli resigned as Chairman of the Board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the SEC.[13]
On June 23, 2008, Samueli pleaded guilty for lying to SEC for $2.2 billion of backdating. Under the plea bargain, Samueli agreed to a sentence of five years probation, a $250,000 criminal fine, and a $12 million payment to the US Treasury.[14][15]
During the technology boom in the 2000s, Samueli and Broadcom co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III awarded millions of stock options to attract and reward employees. Prosecutors alleged Samueli and Nicholas granted options to others, including some other top executives but not themselves, to avoid having to report $2.2 billion in compensation costs to shareholders.[4]
Prosecutors focused on the fact that Samueli denied under oath any role in making options grants to high-ranking executives. As part of his plea agreement, Samueli admitted the statement was false, and admitting to being part of the options-granting process.[4] However, an internal Broadcom probe laid the majority of blame on Henry Nicholas and William Ruehle.
On September 8, 2008, U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney (a fellow UCLA alumnus) rejected a plea deal that called for Samueli to receive probation, writing: "The court cannot accept a plea agreement that gives the impression that justice is for sale".[16]
16 months later, on December 10, 2009, Judge Carney dismissed the case against Samueli, citing Samueli's testimony in another case as well as prosecutorial misconduct.[17]

Education[edit]
Samueli's parents, Sala and Aron, were Polish Jewish immigrants who survived the Nazi occupation of Europe and arrived in the United States with almost nothing.[4] Samueli stocked shelves in his family's Los Angeles liquor store and graduated from Bancroft Junior High School and Fairfax High School.[4] Samueli became interested in electronics when he took a shop class at Bancroft.
Samueli attended UCLA, where he received his bachelor's degree (1975), master's degree (1976), and Ph.D (1980), all in the field of electrical engineering. His Ph.D. advisor was Alan N. Willson Jr. and his Ph.D. dissertation is entitled "Nonperiodic forced overflow oscillations in digital filters".
Broadcom origins[edit]
In 1991, while still working as a professor at UCLA, Samueli co-founded Broadcom with one of his former students, Henry Nicholas. Each invested $5,000 and worked out of Nicholas' Redondo Beach home, moving to Irvine four years later and taking the firm public three years after that.[4] In 1998, when Broadcom became a publicly traded company, Samueli stopped working as a professor, but the UCLA Department of Electrical Engineering still maintains his name on the list of faculty.[citation needed]
Anaheim Ducks ownership[edit]
In June 2005, he and his wife Susan bought the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim from the Walt Disney Company for $75 million. The deal also included Anaheim Arena Management, the company that operates the city-owned Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, the home of the Ducks. In 2006, Samueli announced he was changing the team's name to the Anaheim Ducks and the arena's name to the Honda Center. The Ducks were reportedly worth $188 million in 2011.[5] Under the ownership of Samueli and his wife Susan, the Ducks won the 2007 Stanley Cup championship.
In June 2008, the NHL indefinitely suspended Samueli as owner after he pleaded guilty to lying to U.S. securities regulators.[6] However, on November 12, 2009, National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman reinstated Henry Samueli as owner of the Anaheim Ducks, citing lack of evidence and his outstanding character.[7]
The case was ultimately dismissed on December 10, 2009, by U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney.[8]
In January 2015, Samueli, his wife and his daughter acquired ownership of the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. They subsequently moved the franchise to San Diego as part of the AHL's western expansion that year and the team was re-branded as the fourth incarnation of the San Diego Gulls.[9]
Other interests[edit]
Health and alternative medicine[edit]
Samueli and his wife established the Susan Samueli Center for Integrative Medicine at UC Irvine, and the Samueli Institute for Information Biology in Washington, D.C. The controversial activities of both organizations reflect Susan Samueli's interest in homeopathy and alternative medicine.[10] They have also supported the research of the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, California in cancer prevention and treatment.[11]
Education[edit]




Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA


Before starting Broadcom, Henry Samueli worked in the department of engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, and he and his wife subsequently made major donations to the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and UC Irvine Henry Samueli School of Engineering, which have since been named after him. Samueli's donation founded the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library at Chapman University, which was dedicated in 2005.[4] The Foundation has also given grants to Tarbut V' Torah, Chapman University, the Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA), the Ocean Institute, El Viento, THINK Together, Orangewood’s Guardian Scholar Program, KOCE, the Discovery Science Center and Hope University.
Financial investigation[edit]
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Department of Justice had been investigating Broadcom Corporation for backdating of stock options.[12]
On May 15, 2008, Samueli resigned as Chairman of the Board and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer after being named in a civil complaint by the SEC.[13]
On June 23, 2008, Samueli pleaded guilty for lying to SEC for $2.2 billion of backdating. Under the plea bargain, Samueli agreed to a sentence of five years probation, a $250,000 criminal fine, and a $12 million payment to the US Treasury.[14][15]
During the technology boom in the 2000s, Samueli and Broadcom co-founder Henry T. Nicholas III awarded millions of stock options to attract and reward employees. Prosecutors alleged Samueli and Nicholas granted options to others, including some other top executives but not themselves, to avoid having to report $2.2 billion in compensation costs to shareholders.[4]
Prosecutors focused on the fact that Samueli denied under oath any role in making options grants to high-ranking executives. As part of his plea agreement, Samueli admitted the statement was false, and admitting to being part of the options-granting process.[4] However, an internal Broadcom probe laid the majority of blame on Henry Nicholas and William Ruehle.
On September 8, 2008, U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney (a fellow UCLA alumnus) rejected a plea deal that called for Samueli to receive probation, writing: "The court cannot accept a plea agreement that gives the impression that justice is for sale".[16]
16 months later, on December 10, 2009, Judge Carney dismissed the case against Samueli, citing Samueli's testimony in another case as well as prosecutorial misconduct.[17]

He chose electric and asked the teacher if he could build a Heathkit radio rather than the simpler crystal radio the other kids were making.
He followed the instructions with soldering iron in hand, connecting A to B, B to C and so on, burning himself several times in the process. At the end of the semester, he brought his radio to class. Five vacuum tubes on board and a dial to tune in different stations, the radio was designed to receive AM, FM and shortwave signals.
He plugged it in. Sound came out.
The experience forever changed his life. The radio he built with his own hands worked.
But Henry Samueli had no idea why.
‘CONNECTING EVERYTHING’
Samueli finds it difficult to disconnect.
The inbox is open full-screen on the computer in his modest corner office.


But that’s just a start. He’s always plugged in, whether in London at the Olympics or his owner’s box at a Ducks game. Even on safari, in Africa, Samueli’s hotels have Wi-Fi and the villages he visits are covered by at least 2G cell service. And, at home, every day and every place he goes, from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed at night, his phone is with him.
Connected.
“That’s my life,” Samueli says. “That’s all I do all day.”
He is not the only one. For the first time, Internet-connected handhelds are outselling phones that make only calls and send text messages. In other words, everyone is becoming just as connected as the billionaire co-founder, chief technical officer and chairman of the board at Broadcom Corp.
It’s his own fault.
In 1991, Samueli and another inquisitive engineer, Henry Nicholas, co-founded Broadcom. Their goal was simple: Connect everything. And they did.
The company started by doing something revolutionary at the time – connecting computers to the Internet at previously impossible speeds. The slow, dial-up voice modems of the day were quickly replaced by fast cable modems powered by Broadcom’s chips.
Initially, Broadcom’s world – cable modem connectivity – was more expensive than old, loud, glacially slow dial-up. But as dial-up connections got cheaper, and even after they became free, computer users – i.e. virtually every human on earth – wanted the speed provided by Samueli and Nicholas. Movies downloaded in minutes. Songs played in seconds. Websites loaded instantly.
A whole new interactive Internet was born. And in the next decade, connectedness went wireless, leaping from the home and office to every single person’s pocket.
The pace of this revolution surprised even its leaders.
“Fifteen years ago, we didn’t really have an appreciation we would reach a point everyone would have multimegabit connections with them at all times,” Samueli says.
“You don’t really know what the impact is going to be on society.”
But a few years ago – for a brief period – the pace might’ve been too quick.
In 2007, Samueli was investigated for allegedly partipating in the backdating of $2.2 billion worth of stock options issued to Broadcom employees. Within a year, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Samueli temporarily stepped away from key positions at Broadcom. Eventually, criminal charges against Samueli and Nicholas were thrown out, the SEC dropped its civil case and Samueli resumed his current active roles at Broadcom.
But during that period, Samueli’s company seemed to make a misstep.
Broadcom’s connectivity chips weren’t in the first iPhone, which debuted in 2007.
“I don’t know if anybody thought about how much impact the iPhone could have on society,” Samueli says.
“I was caught by surprise by the iPhone, quite frankly.”
Since then, that’s changed. Broadcom’s chips were in the past four generations of iPhone as well as iPad and most of Apple’s other products. They’re in the guts of many Apple competitors too.
Samueli doesn’t see the need for faster speeds and more connectivity ever abating. The next decade might see the “Internet of things,” with connectivity spreading from every person to everything from your car to your toilet.
“For better or worse, we truly are now always connected,” Samueli says.
“There are obviously pluses and minuses to such extreme connectivity, but I think the pluses outweigh the minuses.”
‘ALWAYS THINKING’ 
In the late 1970s, Susan Samueli was a rarity; a woman with the word “engineer” in her job title. She worked as a systems engineer at IBM.
She suspects it’s why Henry Samueli liked her when, in 1981, they met at a Jewish singles dance. He was tall. She was tall. He was shy. She wasn’t, and she asked him to dance.
She also jokes that her ownership of IBM’s first personal computer, also in 1981, was a reason for their marriage. Henry would use that computer to test programs that would run all night.
One day, in the late ’80s, Samueli came home from work to his wife and young children – and a computer that was missing its keyboard.
“I wanted him to spend more time with the kids,” Susan Samueli says, adding that she eventually gave it back because Henry was moping around.
But such tricks couldn’t always bring Henry back. Even before Broadcom built a world of non-stop connectivity, Samueli seemed connected to problem solving. And that’s still true.
There isn’t a moment his mind isn’t on engineering. In mid-conversation, Susan Samueli sometimes has to bring him back to the subject at hand. During a two-hour car ride with his wife, Samueli can be quiet, his mind fully occupied on work-related problems.
“There’s always something to focus on,” he says.
A silicon chip is composed of hundreds of millions or even billions of tiny transistors. Each is basically an on/off switch. The task for chip designers is to connect these switches together to perform some function – a simple computation like two plus two equals four or advanced algorithms that turn a TV signal into blazing fast Internet access.
Samueli compares the engineering of such chips to telling a designer to build not just a house or a building or a street but, instead, to build an entire city – in a single shot.
“You need to be a very meticulous, detailed-oriented person, which I am,” he said.
“I’m a perfectionist. And that’s served me very well in my career. It allows me to handle these large, complex problems without letting things fall through the cracks … That is the mentality you have to have to attack these complex problems of chip design, for example, when you’re overwhelmed with complexity.
“You have to come up with a very structured way of managing complexity.”
That day with the radio in 7th grade sparked an “intense curiosity to figure out how it worked,” Henry Samueli said. It set him on a mission to become an electrical engineer.
“You can’t believe something like that is working; that you put it together,” he said. “How is this thing working?”
That curiosity drove Samueli – a son of Holocaust survivors who owned a liquor store in Los Angeles – to go to college at UCLA. While there, he was pursuing his doctorate in electrical engineering even before completing his undergraduate work. He took the first graduate-level digital signal processing class from Alan Willson, an engineer and researcher from Bell Labs who would eventually become Samueli’s mentor.
When Samueli began to pursue a Ph.D. – in his case a dissertation about an engineering-related math problem — Willson offered Samueli a possible path toward a solution. But Samueli dismissed his mentor’s idea. It wouldn’t work.
He spent years figuring out a different way to solve the problem.
“When you’re diligent, and you explore all the different avenues and… “
At this, Samueli snaps his fingers.
“Just magically, it happens.”
“For me it’s almost a 24/7 process,” he said. “It’s not like I only think when I’m in the office sitting at my desk.
“I think all the time.”
MARCONI PRIZE
Henry Samueli, 57, figured out a long time ago why his radio worked.
He’s figured out how and why a lot of things work. In his office among all the awards and achievements, near some books on electrical engineering from his college days, a certificate commemorates Samueli’s 50th patent.
Soon, a new award will join the rest.
On Sept. 6, he will be given the prestigious Marconi Prize, named after the inventor of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi. The Marconi comes with a $100,000 award, but, more importantly, Samueli joins an engineering pantheon of sorts by winning it. Previous Marconi winners include the inventors of the Internet and the founders of Google, among others.
Samueli will give the $100,000 to charity, dispatching it to causes that support science, technology, engineering and math education. It’s a process he knows well. Samueli and his wife have given away more than $250 million to causes as disparate as education, alternative medicine and the Jewish community. The man worth $1.8 billion has pledged to give at least half his money to charity in his lifetime.
When Samueli gets the Marconi, he’ll be introduced by his former teacher, Willson. The speech will come after a day of presentations about the future of technology.
Vint Cerf, Google’s chief “Internet evangelist” and a fellow Marconi winner, will talk about the future of social networking. Larry Smarr, founding director at the Calit2 Research Institute, will explore “life chips,” aka using the Internet to track every bodily function. Samueli himself will give a speech about the kinds of chips expected to be designed in the coming decades.
But at the end of the technology speeches, Willson will talk about Samueli.
“He was in the right place at the right time,” Willson says. “And the right guy.”
