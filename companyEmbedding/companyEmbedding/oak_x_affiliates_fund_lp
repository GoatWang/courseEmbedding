Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

 ON 
 Leaf Group 
 
Giving the world what it wants to know.
With information and entertainment now expected to be at everyone’s fingertips, it takes a determined company to make it happen. Today, Leaf Group—with Oak’s investment and partnership—is able to reach more than 125 million visitors every month across a rich portfolio of vertical web properties.


Sean Moriarty, CEO

 take 
 charge 
 
Eliminating the void.
There are an estimated 60 million under-banked consumers in the US. Almost a decade ago, Oak recognized the value of NetSpend’s offerings and seized the opportunity to partner with us. Today, we are a leading provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards that empower these consumers with the convenience, security, and freedom to be self-banked.


Dan Henry, CEO, 
NETSPEND
 
  
   

 SEEING 
 THROUGH 
 
A major force of change. 
One of the larger problems with today’s healthcare system is a lack of transparency for costs. Castlight Health was founded in 2008 to provide individuals unbiased pricing information with which to make smart purchase decisions. With the backing of Oak, Castlight was able to significantly strengthen our solutions, enhance our team, and develop our strategy.


Gio Colella, M.D., CEO & CO-FOUNDER, 
CASTLIGHT HEALTH
 
  
   

 NATURAL 
 FUEL 
 
Clean times two.  
Sundrop Fuels moves forward with building the largest bio-gasoline plant in the world. With continued investment and guidance from Oak, the company has developed and is now in first commercial deployment of their high efficiency, proprietary technology for converting biomass into gasoline.


Wayne Simmons, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
SUNDROP FUELS
 
  
   

 FIBER 
 OPTIMISM 
 
A foundation for connecting.  
Zayo helps carriers, enterprises, schools, and hospitals keep pace with their rapidly growing need for data and Internet bandwidth.  Oak’s investment has helped us grow our operations to include a fiber network that spans 218 markets and 45 states plus Washington, D.C.


Dan Caruso, CO-FOUNDER & CEO,
ZAYO GROUP
 
  
   

 LIFT 
 OFF 
 
Efficiency from the ground up.
At a time of a crucial acquisition in our growth story, Oak joined our investor syndicate and helped finance the acquisition in a very fast and responsive manner.  Ever since, we knew we could always count on strong financial and strategic support from Oak.  They have helped in shaping our international expansion plans and strategies and have been a consistently strong and supportive partner to Kayak.


STEVE HAFNER, CEO & CO-FOUNDER,
KAYAK
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Transforming financial services for a new generation. 
Oak came in to invest in Wonga after having followed the business for quite some time. But once they committed to invest, it was a fast and highly efficient process. Oak truly believes in our vision of transforming the financial services industry, and they bring a differentiated set of experiences with knowledge both of the Internet as well as financial services. Oak is a partner we can always count on and trust to be on our side for the long term.


Errol Damelin, Founder, 
WONGA
 
  
   

 ONE 
 STOP 
 
Bringing it all together. 
What if there were a single, web-based platform for managing benefits? That’s the idea behind Benefitfocus, which integrates benefits in a single place for employers, carriers, and consumers. Oak recognized the growing importance and demand for a solution for shopping, enrolling, and managing healthcare benefits in the cloud.


Shawn Jenkins, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
BENEFITFOCUS
 
  
   

 IT’S ALL IN 
 THE WHEELS 
 
Electric drives get traction.
With interest in hybrid and electric cars at a fever pitch, Protean Electric has developed an in-wheel electric drive system for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric light-duty vehicles. Our partnership with Oak has enabled us to develop a system that can improve vehicle fuel economy, add torque, increase power, and enable improved vehicle handling to both new and existing vehicles.


BOB PURCELL, Vice Chairman, 
PROTEAN ELECTRIC
 
  
   

 SUPPORT 
 SUPREME 
 
Leading the way in outsourced services.  
When Fortune 1000 companies need an integrated, global provider of business process and technology management services, they look to Sutherland. Our singular focus is to drive business performance improvements and solutions that support the entire customer lifecycle. With investment and guidance from Oak, we have grown our global operations to the point where, today, we process over 13 million customer transactions for our clients every month.


Dilip Vellodi, CHAIRMAN AND CEO,
Sutherland Global Services
 
  
   

 GAME 
 ON 
 
Playing an entirely new ballgame. 
With the insatiable desire of sports fans all over the world to get news and information, Bleacher Report has emerged as the go-to source, delivering the Internet’s most engaging sports content experience. Oak’s partnership with the company has helped it grow to be the U.S.’s fourth-largest sports media site, reaching more than 25 million unique readers each month.


BRIAN GREY, CEO,

Financial institutions are always looking for ways to enable better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. Our unique data and analytics provide just that through competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to major financial institutions around the world.

Leonard Laufer, CEO,

Deep clinical insights for managing medical payment policy.
