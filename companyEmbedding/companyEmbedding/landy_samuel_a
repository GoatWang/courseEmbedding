It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to UMH's President and Chief Executive Officer, Samuel Landy.
Samuel Landy
Thank you very much, Nelli. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Core FFO for the quarter was $0.17 per diluted share in both 2017 and 2016. Normalized FFO for the first quarter of 2017 was also $0.17 per diluted share representing an increase of 6.3% year-over-year. Community NOI increased 16% year-over-year. Same-property NOI increased 12.6% year-over-year driven by a same-property occupancy gain of 180 basis points.
UMH had a busy quarter on the acquisition front. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of five communities containing approximately 1,300 developed homesites situated on 382 acres for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $36.5 million. The weighted average occupancy of these communities was 63%.
We have a proven history of improving communities that we acquire by making the necessary investments to bring them up to a high standard.
UMH further recognizes that vacant sites have significant value when the economies surrounding those vacancies improve. Our portfolio is now comprised of 106 communities with 19,300 developed homesites located throughout seven states.

We are very proud of our high quality portfolio and we're recently honored with the manufactured housing expertise, Land-Lease Community of the Year Award for the Northeast Mid-Atlantic Region. This award was for Port Royal Village of 465 sites all-age community situated on approximately 101 acres. This award showcases our dedication to providing quality affordable housing at all of our locations.
We will continue to focus on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leverage our expertise to build long-term value for shareholders. This task is becoming increasingly difficult given the attractiveness of the asset class. Manufactured housing delivers a high quality income stream that many firms and investors are seeking and therefore demand for our property type is very strong.
That being said, we expect to be able to acquire select communities on a one-off basis to continue our growth strategy. The increased demand for property type has resulted in continued cap rate compression. This validates the substantial value that UMH has created by acquiring 66 communities containing approximately 10,400 homesites over the past six years.
UMH also anticipates a number of expansions to our existing community. In particular, we are proud to announce the opening of our first all-rental community Memphis Blues and Memphis Tennessee. This community will results in phases and will ultimately contain over 300 homesites. We continue to execute on our long-term business plan and are very happy with the consistent improvement in our operating metrics.
UMH is on track to growth over $100 million in rental and related income this year. We've added significant value to our existing portfolio by upgrading our communities' thereby increasing occupancy and revenue. Our metrics across the board continued to improve. During the first quarter community net operating income increased by 16.2% and our operating expense ratio has continued to improve year-over-year from 48.5% to 46.8% representing a 170 basis points improvement as occupancy continues to increase the ratio should improve further.
Our same-property results have also strengthened substantially increasing the value of our communities. Same-property occupancy increased from 80.1% to 81.9% year-over-year representing a gain of a 180 basis points. Year-over-year same property revenue increased 7.5% while expenses only increased 1.6% resulting in an increase in same-property NOI of 12.6%. Our strong same-property operating results continue to validate our business plans of acquiring communities in strong geographic locations below replacement costs, making necessary improvements, and growing occupancy and revenue by utilizing our rental home and sales program.
Our rental home program continues to be the primary driver of our occupancy and revenue growth. The demand for our rental home is strong and predominantly all the markets that we operate in. Our product is extremely high in quality and our communities provide amenities and services that other forms of housing cannot at this price point.
During the first quarter we installed and rented approximately 240 homes including those purchased with our community acquisition. At quarter end our rental home portfolio consisted of approximately 4,900 homes representing 26% of our total homesites. Occupancy of our rental homes continues to be strong and was 93.7% at quarter end. 
We plan to install and rent approximately 800 new homes per year as demand dictate. Our sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to pre-recession level. Although this quarter we increased home sales by approximately 12% from $1.7 million in gross sales in 2016 to $1.9 million in 2017 this filing was still not enough for sales operations to be profitable. We are encouraged to see that overall industry shipments in February 2017 increased 19% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of almost 99,000 home. Housing demand and alternative housing costs favor our industry.

Conventional home prices were at pre-recession levels and continued to increase. The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index recorded a 5.8% annual gain in February. Sales of existing homes in March at the highest level in a decade. The supply of homes on the market is low; the unemployment rate is at a 10-year low as higher increases in wages rise. Lower unemployment, wage growth, and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which increases the need for affordable workforce housing. We are optimistic that we will achieve continued growth in 2017.
And now Anna will provide you with greater detail on the results for the first quarter.
Anna Chew
Thank you, Sam. Core funds from operations or core FFO was $5.1 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $4.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the prior year period.
Normalized FFO which excludes realized gains on the sale of securities and other non-recurring items was $5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $4.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the prior year period representing an increase of 6.3% on a per share basis.
Rental and related income for the quarter was $24.5 million compared to $21.8 million a year ago, representing an increase of 13% primarily due to community acquisitions, the addition of rental homes and the growth in occupancy.
Community NOI increased by 16% for the quarter from $11.2 million in 2016 to $13 million in 2017. This is the 11th consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit year-over-year NOI growth.
Community operating expenses for the quarter were 46.8% of rental and related income representing a 170 basis point improvement over the 48.5% expense ratio for the prior year period. As we noted in the past, most of the community expenses consist of fixed costs and therefore as occupancy rates continue to increase and as we upgrade and integrate our acquisitions, these expense ratios will continue to improve.
As we turn to our capital structure, at quarter end, we had approximately $387 million in debt of which $305 million was community level fixed rate mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4% and $82 million were loans payable at a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. 80% of our total debt is fixed rate. The weighted average interest rate on our total debt is 4.1% compared to 4.3% in the prior year period. During the quarter, we renewed and expanded our unsecured revolving credit facility. This increased the borrowing capacity from $35 million to $50 million with a $75 million accordion feature bringing the total potential of availability up to $125 million.
We have reached a milestone this quarter increasing our total enterprise value to over $1 billion representing a 36% increase year-over-year. In addition to our $387 million in debt at quarter end we had a total of $187 million in perpetual preferred equity and an equity market capitalization of $467 million.
From a credit standpoint, our net debt to total market capitalization was 36%. Our net debt less securities to total market capitalization was 26%, our fixed charge coverage was 1.6 times, our net debt to EBITDA was 7.3 times, and net debt less securities to EBITDA was 5.2 times.
From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the quarter with $8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $108 million in our securities portfolio encumbered by $29 million in margin loans, and $15 million available on our credit facility. We also had $28 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory.
And now let me turn it over to Gene before we open it up for questions.
Eugene Landy
Thank you, Anna. UMH is celebrating its 50th year of operations. As Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, I'm pleased with the substantial progress UMH has made in its long-term strategic business plan.

As Sam mentioned over the past six years, we have more than doubled the size of our portfolio by acquiring 66 communities containing approximately 10,400 homesites. We have increased occupancy and revenue with these communities thereby generating significant increased value to our shareholders.
UMH's first quarter results were an excellent start to 2017. We have delivered solid performance metrics with double-digit growth in rental revenue, home sales, total NOI, and same-property NOI. The performance of our securities portfolio has been excellent.
We are very pleased with our current holdings which had a $14.7 million in net unrealized gains at quarter end. The future prospects for UMH Properties are excellent. We continue to focus on our business plan and have positioned ourselves for strong growth in 2017 and beyond.
We will now be happy to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
Our first question comes from Craig Kucera of Wunderlich. Please go ahead.
Craig Kucera
With the acquisitions you completed this quarter they were all in kind of mid-to-late January. What was the impact to operating expenses quarter if any and how should we think about what the budget is to may be clean those up this year and next year, if you can provide that?
Anna Chew
I think in the beginning, we had additional -- some additional expenses but I believe that before the end of the year, we will bring it back down to our normal operating expense ratio of about 46%, 47%.
Craig Kucera
Got it. So we should see a bump I guess in the next quarter or so bringing down --
Anna Chew
Yes.
Craig Kucera
Then coming back, okay. This is a big quarter for acquisitions for you and I appreciate the commentary on the market and may be doing more one-offs but how should we think about the rest of the year, do we think that first quarter was probably the bulk of acquisition volume for this year?
Brett Taft
Yes, this is Brett Taft here, Vice President of Acquisitions and we have only one property in our pipeline right now for about $4 million, we are working on a couple other one-off deals nothing, I'd like to comment on too much further right now but I would expect some continued growth throughout the year.
Craig Kucera
Got it. With the administration change and turnover in Congress are you hearing or seeing any movement in regard to loosening lending as regards to manufactured home sales?
Eugene Landy
We just returned from the MHI Conference in Las Vegas and there was very, very upbeat. We're making substantial progress on all the legislative fronts. We are making very good progress with FHA, with Freddie Mac. We are very optimistic, it's going to take a little more time but we think our ability to get the government sponsored entities to provide mortgages on our products and hopefully channel mortgages on homes for both of us and our tenants.
So we think the legislative front, we're going to make substantial progress and we really should I mean the regulatory environment used to be very restrictive and we're hopeful that we can expand our lending and expand our ability to finance new communities.
Craig Kucera
Okay, one more for me, I will jump back in the queue. With the expansion of the line, are you likely to utilize that more heavily and keep a higher balance on that or you more inclined to continue to predominantly finance yourself with mortgages?
Anna Chew
Well we do a little bit of both because right now the interest rates are really -- the protected low interest rates are great for us while mortgages and we can get 10-year financing at a fixed rate of around I would say between 4.25 to 4.5. So we'll do a little bit of both, some of the communities that we purchase do not qualify for Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae financing because again we're buying 63% or 60% occupied communities, those we can put in the line and utilize the line.

Operator
The next question comes from Brian Hollenden of Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Brian Hollenden
Good morning guys and thanks for taking my call.
Samuel Landy
Thank you.
Brian Hollenden
Can you talk a little bit about I noticed year-over-year the proceeds from the Trip program kind of was about $13.5 million higher, just may be talk about a little bit why the big change?
Eugene Landy
Well I really like the Trip and Sip and we've been really pushing very hard to get on the MSCI Index and the RMC Index which we balances I think Monday. So we will find out Monday if all our efforts are successful. The higher capitalization you have the more likely you're going to get on the index and we've increased the outstanding shares to 31 million shares and at the current market price, we're very close to $500 million market capitalization and isn't this always but one of the reasons we've been interested in raising capitalization rather than borrowing money or issuing more preferred is because of the way the index works. And we're one of the few REITs that is not on the index and we're going to find out if we go on the index with the milestone for the company but we have no control over that, that's done by the people who run the index.
Brian Hollenden
Appreciate that color. Turning now may be to the sale of manufactured homes, seasonally the first quarter and the fourth quarter are weaker due to weather, but what are you kind of seeing as we move into the spring and what's going on, on that front, can you talk a little bit about the sales effort and may be what we should expect over the next six months?
Samuel Landy
Well I believe we're seeing improvement in sales. We have the sale centers at Port Royal Village, Heather Highlands, Sunnyside, and when there's no sales, it's very hard to properly staff those or get them going but as sales improve, success generates success, so things are getting better and I think we could do far better and I think 2017 may be a turning point on sales but it's still just the start of what we can really do.
Eugene Landy
In a way home competition, the rental program is so successful. It is so well received $750 to $850 a month we provide a three bedroom home with two bath which is very competitive in the area and it's really a good deal for the consumer. And at those costs we compete with ourselves on semi-homes particularly unless we can get lower cost financing. Competitively people are renting but we're very happy that rentals are doing so well.
And if I make one more observation which I make every time, the overall housing situation in the United States is that there's a shortage of housing and there's a really serious shortage of affordable housing and we're in markets that are growing and population growing and workforce. So our prospect is not quarter-to-quarter but year-to-year is very good in our opinion.
Brian Hollenden
Thanks. And I'm sorry if I missed this earlier but did you sort of update expectations on how many rentals you do plan on adding in 2017 is 800 to 1,000 about the right number?
Samuel Landy
That's right. That's the right range. We acquired some rentals in acquisitions and we -- demand certainly has allowed us last year and most likely this year to add 800 on our own. So somewhere between 800 and 1,000 is most likely.
Brian Hollenden
Okay. And any maybe just last for me and I will get back into queue any major changes in the Marcellus region in terms of demands?
Samuel Landy
Well, yes, the minute after the election, we got calls from the drilling companies et cetera that they were hiring again and that they needed houses and I'm talking about it was two days after the election and also we're going to close on our first gas lease in a number of years, where we sold the drilling rights for $265,000 and 19% royalties and that should close this month I believe, yes.

Eugene Landy
We're still as bullish as we go by at every presentation on what the Marcellus and Utica Shale will do so the areas in which is located which includes the main areas in which we have communities.
Operator
The next question comes from Paula Poskon of STOV Advisory Services. Please go ahead.
Paula Poskon
I just have one follow-up on your commentary about your all-rental community in Memphis that you're working on. Are you optimistic that an all-rental community will make it easier to get financing through the GSCs? And more broadly what is your appetite for having more all-rental communities in the portfolio?
Samuel Landy
Well we think it's a great model and we love to do it again and again. An apartment builder builds a 1,000 square foot three bedroom two bath units for $250,000. We could build it for about $100,000 and that makes us extremely cost competitive for the people who want housing plus there's no common-wall neighbor above you, below you, or under you.
So as a rental product, the acceptance is incredible which is why we're renting out 800 or 900 homes per year. We're really looking forward to completing the occupancy of Memphis Blues. There's currently homes rented there. The grand opening is actually not going to be until next month but even before the grand opening, we've rented houses and it's going very well. And yes, we look forward to doing more and Anna will tell you about the financing.
Anna Chew
Well what we’ve done is we have a roundtable discussion with the GSCs as matter of fact with Fannie Mae and then we had a meeting with Freddie Mac. And they were very receptive to this program. They don't know if they can do it yet but they are thinking about it when we have an all-rental community because as we've pointed out, it's very similar to a garden apartment. They have questions regarding of course the maintenance of it but I said it’s just like any other maintenance of a garden apartment what is the difference. So they were very receptive to it, they're thinking about it, we can't do anything of course until it is more built up and more occupied. But they have it in their radar screen.
Paula Poskon
Thank you. And just one last question on that, do you expect there will be any difference in the expense ratio in managing an all-rental property versus an ownership rental mix community?
Samuel Landy
Interestingly, right now new revenue was coming in at a 36% expense ratio which is lower than the current overall UMH expense ratio. So you have to factor in these are brand new rental units but I don't see any reason that it's good, the expense ratio is going to exceed our norms which are 50% if we are paying the water and sewer, and 30% if it's direct billed to the resident. So it seems like all is going very well on the expenses in managing the rental units and at this moment I see no reason to believe that's going to change.
Anna Chew
Of course it's the beginning because we are in the beginning phases of Memphis Blues, there are some I will call them fixed costs which we will have to go over as we build the community.
Operator
The next question comes from Michael Boulgaris of Boulgaris Investments. Please go ahead.
Michael Boulgaris
Thank you, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Sam could you give us an update as to the progress in Saratoga?
Samuel Landy
Yes. We've completed approximately 63, 64 lots. We're ready to go. There is homes setup, they are absolutely gorgeous, the timing is perfect because Saratoga is a very seasonal area and we're really looking forward to kicking this off. We already have interest in a couple of homes of sale and we're very excited about it and it's ready to go.
Michael Boulgaris
And mentioned you comment on just traffic overall by region that you're seeing earlier this year?

Samuel Landy
Yes, we have a traffic report that tells us how we're doing on traffic. And it is higher than ever for the season. I mean quarter two was usually your highest traffic of the year but quarter one 2017 well dramatically exceeds 1,400 homes was the traffic in quarter one 2016, a little over 1,600 was the traffic first quarter 2017.
Michael Boulgaris
Okay. And I'm going to miss it but I believe same-property occupancy was 84.5% at year-end 2016. Could you refresh me what the same-property occupancy was at the end of Q1?
Anna Chew
At the end of Q1, same-property occupancy, now don't forget it's a different same-property pool because we update it every year. Same-property pool for 2017 are properties that were owned as of -- see January 1, 2016, and same-property occupancy for the 2016 numbers were properties owned as of January 1, 2015. So you have to take that into account. But the same-property occupancy as of March 31, 2017, on this new pool is 81.9% compared to a year ago, this pool was 80.1%.
Michael Boulgaris
Very well. And Anna with the I guess the number of acquisitions in Q1 was above the operating expense a bit frontloaded this year or maybe you could just -- if you could give us some guidance as to where that's going to level out some in terms of the rate of growth?
Anna Chew
Absolutely we always have a little more expenses when we first acquired the community well, some cleanup et cetera but we believe that these communities will generate approximately the same expense ratio as our other communities.
Brett Taft
And just to add a little more color there. Two properties we purchased in Indiana were very high quality; we shouldn't expect too many increased expenses on that front. One of the properties acquired in Ohio and one of the properties in Pennsylvania will require a little bit more of an increase in initial expenses but the way we've structured our acquisition program, we intend to take care of them within the first six months in ownership now, the other property in Ohio should not dramatically increase expenses, so.
Samuel Landy
And Brett, tell him about how optimistic we are on Hillcrest and what's going on there.
Brett Taft
We purchased Hillcrest Crossing in Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania it was a -- it is a 200 site community it was purchased 40% occupied, the old owner just did not have the resources they needed to make it move forward. We demoed about 30 to 40 units in the community already it looks fantastic, we have 20 homes on order all of which are spoken for. So we expect to infill that community very quickly at some meaningful value.
Michael Boulgaris
Are you saying is that petrochemical complex starting to be more impactful in terms of your Western PA occupancy?
Samuel Landy
Yes, this is the Pittsburgh area that's where Hillcrest is and we know just what happened nobody in the area did well for 10 years and they're basically giving up and we're coming in and we see the turnaround occurring every day. And we are workforce housing we're 100% dependent on the job market for blue collar workers but the job market is improving dramatically and we get to ride that wave.
Anna Chew
And we're also putting in brand new homes that people have not seen in the recent past.
Samuel Landy
Let me cover the shell cracker plant. I believe it's between $2 billion and $4 billion and will require 10,000 people to build it over three years but it's -- they have not yet started construction but that's a pretty arbitrary line because pre-construction work was pretty substantial moving six lane highways and putting in utilities and that sort of thing but the shell is going ahead with this cracker plant and my understanding of the oil and gas industry is everyone expects two or three more plants of the same size in the same areas as they develop experience with it. So it’s going to be a very, very positive job and employment and economic growth of that area which is going to be fantastic there. I always tell you Pittsburgh is going to be like Qatar and the Middle East 10 years from now.

Brett Taft
And Mike the thing we should tell everybody Google Panda Plants. Panda Plants take natural gas out of the ground and convert it to electricity, it's the most efficient form of electric generating ever created. They are opening these billion dollar plants all over Pennsylvania and it's going to be fantastic for Pennsylvania and fantastic for us.
Michael Boulgaris
And lastly if I could ask the Chairman Gene, I guess in Philadelphia last fall, you spoke I think got rather optimistically regarding the dividends, you continue to have that optimism looking ahead and may be also if you could give us some perspective looking in terms of the intrinsic value or speaking to the total return of UMH, what you see in the future as you witnessed UMH in tough times and now as things are starting to look better?
Eugene Landy
Well it's a cycle, what we're doing is building value into the parks and the parks are going ahead nicely and as we increase the occupancy and increase the rent, the ability to mortgage these parks increases. We think it takes several years to get to the point we can go back to Freddie Mac and I believe we borrow what is 70%, 75%.
Anna Chew
70% to 75%.
Eugene Landy
70% to 75% of value and at that point when we can take a product that we bought and have turned around and go back and get the investment we made out of it, in fact get additional cash, there's a substantial amount of money that we can refinance and we're talking $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, an additional financing over the next two, three years based on the increased income from these parks. And as those numbers are realized and it just takes time to show Freddie Mac's that we're getting these results and going pipe for the mortgages and get them and then that cash really changes.
Right now we put in $40 million in rental home, so we finance it largely out of our own equity and we will get all that equity back plus and I'm very optimistic that we will be able to increase the dividend substantially over the years as we increase occupancy with 19,300 sites with almost 3,000 vacancies and as we fill these vacancies, our financial strength will be substantial. So we will take a good look at the dividend as these numbers continue to improve.
Operator
And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Samuel Landy
Thank you very much Nelli. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. UMH was one of the top performing REITs in 2016 with a total shareholder return of 59%. It was an excellent year for UMH, highlighted by our normalized FFO per share growth of 20%. This marks our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth.
For the fourth quarter, our normalized FFO was $0.18 per diluted share fully covering our $0.18 per share quarterly dividend. UMH is continued to opportunistically acquire value-add communities. In 2016, we purchased a total of three communities containing approximately 300 developed homesites situated on 219 acres for an aggregate cost of approximately $7.3 million.
Subsequent to year-end, we completed the acquisition of an additional five communities containing approximately 1,300 developed homesites situated on 382 acres for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $36.5 million. Our portfolio is now comprised of 106 communities with 19,300 developed homesites located throughout seven states. We will continue to focus on acquiring communities with significant upside potential and leverage our expertise to build long-term value for shareholders.
Our product is workforce housing, the return of manufacturing jobs to the areas where we operate as well as increased our occupancy in income. Our results are directly tied to the fortunes of the economies in these areas. Our communities in the energy rich Marcellus and Utica Shale regions are poised for additional growth given the new administration's pro-domestic energy initiatives.

Additionally, technological advances have reduced the cost of drilling. Oil and gas companies in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions are again profitable. We are seeing interest for new oil and gas leases. New drilling will spur the continued growth in the local economies. Lower energy prices reduce the cost of manufacturing in the northeast and we directly benefit as new jobs are created in our regions.
UMH recognized that vacant lots have significant value when the economy surrounding those vacancies improves. Our 1,000 square foot, three bedroom, two bath homes are readily accepted as workforce housing at returns that have made UMH one of the best performing REITs in 2016. Our 3,500 vacant sites provide us with opportunity to continue to rapidly improve our results for the next several years.
I will now focus on our performance for the full-year and then Anna will drill down further on our fourth quarter results. Our metrics across the Board continue to improve. In 2016, community net operating income increased by 27.4% and our operating expense ratio has continued to improve from 49.6% in 2015 to 47% in 2016. Our same-property results have also strengthened substantially increasing the value of our communities.
Same-property occupancy increased from 82.9% at year-end 2015 to 84.8% at year-end 2016 representing a gain of 190 basis points. Year-over-year same-property revenue increased 12.9% while expenses only increased 6.1% resulting in an increase in the same-property NOI of 18.9%.
Our strong same-property operating results continue to validate our business plan of acquiring communities in strong geographic locations below replacement costs, making necessary improvements and growing occupancy and revenue by utilizing our rental home and sales programs.
Our rental home program continues to be the primary driver of our occupancy and revenue growth. It is the most efficient way to increase our occupancy thereby increasing the value of our communities which can then be realized through refinancing.
During 2016, we installed and rented approximately 900 homes. At year-end, our rental home portfolio consisted of approximately 4,700 homes representing 26% of our total homesites. The demand for our rental homes continues to be strong demonstrated by a rental home occupancy of 91.5%. This demand is driven by the need for affordable workforce housing in our geographic areas. In 2016, national home prices increased 5.8%.
Upward pressure on existing home price is due to tight supply, rising mortgage rates, and stringent mortgage requirements have steered housing demand to renting. These factors will propel demand to our sector since we can provide quality housing at the lowest cost in any given market.
Our sales of manufactured homes have not yet returned to pre-recession levels, although this year we increased home sales by approximately 26% from $6.8 million in gross sales in 2015 to $8.5 million in 2016. This volume is still not enough for our sales operation to be profitable. At some point, our potential home buyers will find their ability to access financing improve, when this happens, our sales will increase.
Further, the 55 and older buyer, who depends on being able to sell their existing single family home and using the equity for their purchase of a manufactured home has been sidelined while waiting for the value of their existing home to increase. We are encouraged to see conventional home prices finally rising to pre-recession levels. We are working hard to once again make home sales on major source of income at UMH and we believe that it will return to its full potential as a major profit center as our nation's economy continues to improve and at lending standards return to normal.
And now, Anna will provide you with greater detail on our results for the quarter.

Anna Chew
Thank you, Sam. Core Funds from Operations or Core FFO was $5.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $3.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the prior year period, representing an increase of 43% on a per share basis. Normalized FFO, which excludes realized gains or the sale of securities and other non-recurring items, was $5.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $3.8 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the prior year period, representing an increase of 29% on a per share basis.
For the full-year 2016, Core FFO was $20.7 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to $14.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share for 2015. Normalized FFO was $18.4 million or $0.66 per diluted share for 2016, compared to $14.2 million or $0.55 per diluted share for 2015, representing a 20% increase on a per share basis.
Rental and related income for the quarter was $23.4 million compared to $20.6 million a year ago, representing an increase of 13%, primarily due to community acquisitions, the addition of rental homes and the growth and occupancy. Community NOI increased by 17% for the quarter from $10.9 million in 2015 to $12.7 million in 2016. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit year-over-year NOI growth. Community operating expenses for the quarter were 45.6% of rental and related income, representing a 170 basis point improvement over the 47.3% expense ratio for the prior year period.
As Sam mentioned, for the year, our expense ratio was 47%, compared to 49.6% for 2015. As we noted in the past, most of the community expenses consist of fixed cost and therefore as occupancy rates continues to increase and as we upgrade and integrate our acquisitions, these expense ratios will continue to improve.
Our lease securities portfolio continued to deliver strong results increasing from $75 million at year-end 2015 to $109 million at year-end 2016 representing 13% of our growth asset value at year-end with an unrealized gains of $16.7 million. Our securities portfolio generated $6.6 million in dividend income and $2.3 million in net realized gains during the year.
As we turn to our capital structure, at year-end we had approximately $351 million in debt of which $293 million was community level mortgage debt at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4% and $58 million were loans payable and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.1%, 85% of our total debt is fixed rate.
During the year, we have financed, refinanced four communities for a total of $32 million reducing our overall weighted-average interest rates on our mortgage debt from 4.6% to 4.4%. We are currently in the process of renewing our unsecured credit facility, which is set to mature later this year. In keeping with our growth strategy, this year show us closing in on a $1 billion total enterprise value.
During the year, we issued 2 million shares of our 8% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock resulting in $49 million in net proceeds. This combined with our additional Series B preferred shares and our Series A preferred shares resulted in a total of approximately $187 million in perpetual preferred equity at year-end.
Out total preferred stock combined with an equity market capitalization of $442 million and our $351 million in debt results in a total market capitalization of approximately $980 million at year-end, representing a 30% increase year-over-year. From a credit standpoint, our net debt to total market capitalization was 35%. Our net debt for securities to total market capitalization was 24%. Our fixed charge coverage was 1.7 times. Our net debt to EBITDA was 6.9 times, and our net debt for securities to EBITDA was 4.7 times.

From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the year with $4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $109 million in our securities portfolio, encumbered by $23 million in margin loans, and $15 million available on our credit facility, which was drawn down subsequent to year-end for the funding of the acquisition of five communities. We also have $28 million available on our revolving lines of credit for the financing of home sales and the purchase of inventory.
And now, let me turn it over to Eugene before we open it up for questions.
Eugene Landy
Thank you, Anna. As Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, I am pleased with the substantial progress UMH has made in its long-term strategic business plan. At double-digit annual earnings growth over each of the past four years is an achievement to be proud of. UMH is part of the housing market. We have seen numerous demand tailwinds propelling out industry for a decade the U.S. has been building fewer homes than the 1.5 million homes needed to provide for new family formation and the replacement of older homes.
Today the available home inventory is shrinking. The deficit in the housing starts ultimately needs to be filled. The demographic picture is very favorable. The unemployment rate has continued to drop and is now under 5%. Wages have begun to rise. These factors enhanced household formations by millennials, the largest segment of the U.S. population. With rising demand comes rising prices, the affordability of our homes becomes more and more apparent. The future housing and business prospects for UMH Properties are excellent.
As Sam stated, we have reached the point where our dividends are now once again covered by our normalized FFO. The free cash flow above and beyond that dividend requirement is the path that ultimately leads to dividend growth. We continue to be focused on our business plan and have positioned ourselves to strong growth in 2017 and beyond.
We will now be happy to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Kucera of Wunderlich. Please go ahead.
Craig Kucera
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Anna Chew
Good morning, Craig.
Craig Kucera
Hey there. I wanted to talk about the acquisitions you closed on earlier this year. Can you talk about the going-in cap rates on those acquisitions? And just give us some color on maybe how we should think about the incremental expense to clean those communities up maybe this year and even next year?
Eugene Landy
Well, firstly, instead of going-in cap rates, the thing we focus on most is the real estate. We are very focused on buying parks that have substantial vacancies and that we can fill those vacancies by purchasing new manufactured homes to use as rental units.
We of course are conscious when we buy these parks that we want to return our investment and we want to return our investment of between 6% and 7%, but that return is not the critical factor because the critical factor is the return on our investment after we purchase additional rental units.
And when we fill the parks and those numbers I believe in the 10-K and Annual Report Sam will cover, is the kind of returns we get with all the factors per placed in. It would be an overstatement to say that we're buying a substantial number of units, but nothing, but the lots are very valuable. The empty space is a very valuable and they are particularly variable if we are enabled to put in homes, rent them and do that over process of two or three years.
As we always point out, there are costs involved. For some reasons we have to expense the cost of upgrading the parks we bought. We have expense a lot of the costs, we are getting the lots ready for the rental units and the first year or two the returns we report are not substantial and neither are they significant. The returns that we get when we fill these parks with the rental units are very substantial and we're very pleased with our program for buying new communities. We've gone from 7,000 units to 18,000…

Anna Chew
19,003.
Eugene Landy
19,003. We've added about 12,000 units to our portfolio and we're very pleased with the results of this accretive acquisition program.
Craig Kucera
Okay. So I guess let me ask it a bit differently then, because I agree. I do see the value on the backend. But in the near term, it was a fairly large - at least from a unit purchase size relative to the portfolio. So somewhere - asking it a different way, have you seen cap rates move up since the election? I know last year, you guys were - you didn't acquire as much as you had maybe in the prior year or two. And just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the market.
Samuel Landy
The cap rates continue to go down. I mean you have to pay more for the properties - it’s Sam Landy here. Now you are closer to a five cap, six cap on what people are asking on acquisitions, but the acquisitions we did in 2016 were exactly what we're looking for and usually doing, three communities, 289 sites with 215 lots occupied, 74% occupancy that we looked at the employers surrounding those communities and we looked at the area and we're sure that because we have the money to invest in upgrading the properties and adding rental units, we will do better than the prior owner.
The later acquisitions that are 2017 include Boardwalk and Parke Place which that's kind of a rather unusual acquisition for us because those were first class communities. Boardwalk is 195 sites, 98% occupied. Parke Place is 364 sites, 76% occupied. Both first class communities with swimming pool clubhouse, they are 6.5% to 7.5% cap rates going in.
But the most important thing to now they adjoin - those two communities are adjoining and they adjoin one of our communities giving us approximately 900 sites in one location in Indiana and when you expand the number of sites, if we take a 160 lot community, we make it 320, every lots more valuable because of the efficiencies of running all those sites from one office.
So Boardwalk and Parke Place, plus the community we already owns there, Highland will all have top-notch management. They will be better able to generate sales income, rental income and the value of our existing sites plus those sites will now go up because they're all together.
Craig Kucera
Got it. Looking at your CapEx for this next year, I think in 2016, you expected to maybe spend $15 million on CapEx. Can you talk about what your CapEx plan is for the next year, and how many rental units you think you will likely put into the ground?
Samuel Landy
Sure. So the CapEx is $8 million with $4 million being the CapEx for our existing properties and $4 million for the upgrades to the acquisitions that we just announced and are doing. On top of that, we hope to add 900 rental units with the cost of the rental unit plus the setups 40,000 a sites of $36 million that will generate [7,200,000] a year in new income. Our other capital need with sales increase, we finance home sales and we need the money to finance those home sales and we're hoping to improve sales in excess of $10 million with $5 million of that being financed by us and those are your capital needs.
Craig Kucera
Got it. And it looks like post these acquisitions your line of credit is more or less maxed out. But you do have room to use the margin or use your borrow on margin against securities. Is that how we should think about you funding yourself this year? And as far as the mortgages rolling off this year, is there likely a positive spread between those coming off maybe somewhere in the 6% range being able to refi maybe in the low-to-mid force?
Anna Chew
Hi, Craig, this is Anna. Regarding our line of credit, yes, it does mature this year, but we are in the process of renewing it and expanding it. That's number one. Number two, we do have availability on our securities portfolio, but don’t - we want to be conservative with that. So we never take it up to the full availability.

The third question that you had with regarding the mortgages that are coming off this year and we believe that we will be able to refinance those at approximately I would say between 4.5% to 5% maybe a little lower than the 5% and also obtain money additional funds from that because some of those are hasn’t mortgage for 10 years and we've had built in gains on those.
Craig Kucera
Got it. And one more from me and I'll jump back in the queue. I guess looking at your rental unit occupancy over the past few quarters, it does look like it has dropped a bit year-over-year and can you give us some color on traffic and maybe how renewals have been trending?
Eugene Landy
Traffics better than ever, renewals better than ever, the number 91% factors in new homes setup, but not yet occupied, factors in acquisition of communities that have rental units that may need upgrading to our standard. So everybody I talk out in the field, our managers, regional managers all say demand is as strong as stronger than ever. I know that the rate of our views on our website and the traffic we're generating are higher than ever.
Craig Kucera
All right, thanks guys.
Eugene Landy
Thank you.
Operator
And the next question comes from Brian Hollenden of Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Brian Hollenden
Good morning and thanks for taking my call. To follow-up on the last question, are you seeing specific pockets of strength in rentals or is the demand broad-based?
Samuel Landy
Well, it's broad-based, but the important point there everything UMH did is intentional. So first of all, our capital structure is intentional, which gives us $1 billion worth of assets with only 30 million shares outstanding. Second of all the location of our properties is intentional. The Marcellus and Utica Shale area, the Nashville market, the Memphis market, Indiana, right now we're told that they need 50,000 people to come to Elkhart, Indiana to fill the jobs and they don't know where they're going to house them.
So every location we went to, first of all, we know the difficulties and the expense of trying to obtain approved lots, that’s a near impossibility. And then we found that these communities were for sale with vacant site due to - I go back to NAFTA that when we sent manufacturing overseas, these jobs left these areas and these communities that were once 100% occupancy occupied fell down to 65% occupancy. So we were able to purchase these communities and the reason we did it was visiting our own communities that had the same problem.
We found that the extended stay hotels were 100% full and we were looking into what was going on and this is seven, eight, 10 years ago and we found out about Marcellus and Utica Shale and the fact that there is natural gas and oil in the ground there and that pipelines are being built to bring the natural gas to our ports. That pipelines are being built to run the natural gas to the Panda plants that generate electricity and the gas is being run to our cities.
All of this is still in its infancy and the demand for natural gas increases every year, the building of factories that will convert natural gas to plastics. All of these things are just beginning. So this region of the country, which had a devastated economy for the past 10 years, may now be one of the fastest growing areas of the country and UMH was very fortunate and acted very opportunistically to acquire these communities and we are only starting to show you what's going to happen here.
Eugene Landy
Yes. This is Gene Landy, Chairman. If I could answer what I think is implicit in your question, the apartment REITs in the United States are doing a wonderful job. They've been building 200,000, 400,000 units. They have been building units the cost of $250,000 to $300,000 a unit. They are satisfying demand in the urban areas. They're building studios and one bedroom, maybe 15% of that amount two bedrooms, so when you read about what's happening in the apartment area do not transpose that over to the affordable housing area that UMH is in.

We are in a different market. We produce 1,000 square feet of home, two bedrooms, three bedrooms and we want them for $800 a month and the demand is very strong and it is remaining strong. So I just wanted to make sure that when you see apartment REITs reporting some softness that we are in a completely different market than we are.
Brian Hollenden
Thanks for the color. And just have one additional question. Can you talk about the financing environment for individuals? Has there been any change in 2016? What specifically could happen in 2017 to improve home sales for individuals?
Samuel Landy
UMH was able to obtain a higher rate of approvals in 2016 working with Triad, so we were very happy with that, but things can still get way better. Dodd-Frank, the SAFE Act, and Truth in Lending come together to prevent waiters and waitresses from buying houses that they prevent - a person could be coming from a $300,000 house they couldn't afford, now they want to buy a $40,000 house, but they have bad credit from the $300,000 house they're prevented from buying a house.
People with student loans, somebody can graduate Harvard Law School and they have their debt and they can buy a $40,000 manufactured home. So the rule has come together to absolutely stop us from financing the people who could benefit the most from owning our houses. We've spoken directly with both the Democratic and the Republican leader of the House and the Senate, everybody agrees their needs to be changed, they were unable to do it before the election and hopefully it will get done after the election.
Brian Hollenden
All right. Thank you for the color.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Boulgaris of Boulgaris Investments Inc. Please go ahead.
Michael Boulgaris
Good morning and congratulations on an outstanding year.
Samuel Landy
Thank you.
Michael Boulgaris
Sam, Hillcrest Crossing northeast of Pittsburgh has I guess an occupancy of about 40% according to your, I think, supplemental. Can you share with us your expectations of this newly acquired community in the context of the Shell petrochemical complex that are currently being built in Beaver County?
Samuel Landy
Yes. We’ve done incredibly well in this area; anything near Pittsburgh including one of the communities is six miles from the Pittsburgh Airport. So this particular community it's not far from shopping malls, it's not far from highways, and it looks like it had 15 plus really bad years and it is definitely going to take us three, four years to turn this around, but we bought it for less than the cost of having the land and getting the approvals $12,500 per site we purchased it for.
We're going to fix that up, add rental units, generate home sales, and we’ll easily make it worth $30,000, $40,000 a site. I should take a moment to thank the entire UMH staff for the incredible job they did getting us here. And we have a Vice President and Regional Manager out there. They've done a tremendous job. We just closed on this particular community. They're removing homes every day. They're bringing in the new homes and renting them out. They're going incredibly fast.
But I would still say it's going to take three years to turn it around, but we're doing an incredible job there. Part of the reason it takes three years. We have to change the reputation of communities and that's probably actually the hardest part that you make your changes the first-year, the second-year people start to see them and it's only the third-year that it has a new reputation and the occupancy really starts to increase quickly.
Michael Boulgaris
And if we could go south a bit, you had some challenges with I think the utility company in some of your Tennessee expansion. Can you provide us an update there?

Samuel Landy
I'm very happy to tell you that Memphis Blues is now officially opened. Six homes are already rented. There's 15 homes fully setup with another 15 homes being setup in the next four weeks. And we expect at the next call, we will have most of those occupied.
Eugene Landy
This is a pioneering project. I was actually pleased to hear that one of the largest homebuilders is also doing a similar project. So we're doing a housing development, a conventional housing development, except for the fact that we're not going to sell the homes, we're going to rent them. And one of the convention homebuilders and we know is doing 250 homes and is not putting them up for sale, but it's going to rent 250 homes. And we and Memphis with Memphis Blues will have a brand new community and we will not sell the homes, we will rent the homes. And we think the - and it’s right in Memphis itself, it’s a great location and we're very optimistic that we can build a community, put the homes in and have an all-rental community.
Michael Boulgaris
Thank you for that color. Anna, can you break out our home sales for the quarter and give us some sense as to your outlook for the current year in this - in-home sales?
Anna Chew
Sure. For the quarter - quarter-by-quarter, in the first quarter we had about $1.7 million in home sales, in the second quarter it was about $2.8 million, in the third quarter it was about $2.3 million, and in the fourth quarter it was $1.8 million for total of $8.5 million in home sales. Of course, this is still not up to where it was in pre-recessions levels where we have $16 million in home sales for one-year and we made $1 million to $2 million.
We would like it to go up. It all depends on a lot of things, the economy, it depends on the regulations, and hopefully the regulations will ease as Sam has mentioned and that we will go back to the pre-recession levels. Don't forget also that we have more than doubled the size of our portfolio. When we had the $16 million in sales, we only had 28 communities, now we have 106 communities. So we believe that if home sales go back up, we will really make this a profitable center for UMH.
Michael Boulgaris
Okay. Finally, Sam, perhaps you can speak to the overall momentum of the business heading into 2017 and some of your goals that you have. Maybe you or Gene, I know, I think congratulations is in order. You said you would grow into the dividend and you did. But looking forward, can you provide us some guidance as to the criteria that the Board might employ when considering a dividend boost?
Samuel Landy
Start at the beginning, first, national shipments for the year up 35% and we really have to thank the manufacturers, all the manufacturers we work with Clayton, Cafko, Skyline, Eagle River, all the manufacturers, they produce a fantastic product, the three bedroom, two bath, beautiful kitchen, home's, single roof, vinyl sided. It's a great house. And our customer - no common wall neighbor above them, below them, they get it yard, they have everything.
So the demand for the product, it goes all the way back to 1999 when the recession of manufactured housing started, eventually we lost our distribution network of independent dealers. So a lot of people don't really know about the manufactured home product and every day we get that message out more and more, more and more people see our houses for the first time and as they get to know the product they readily accept the product and because societies change from wanting to own to wanting to rent, they really except the rental product very quickly. We rent 900 homes in a year.
As per sales, the higher rent homes, the 55 and older, those people need to be able to sell their existing house and have equity to buy a home and because home prices arising, we really see that happening. In addition to opening Memphis Blues, we are also in the next month opening up the Brookview expansions, which is in Greenfield just outside Saratoga and that's 54 a lots of houses that are going to sell for well over $100,000.

So we believe that we have a lot of opportunity to increase the sales income. Now looking strictly at without the sales income adding 900 rental units adds $7.2 million. The current expense ratio is 47%, but what I see is that the expense ratio on the new revenue is even lower than that, but however if you factored in between the 4% rent increase, which you've got almost $100 million in revenues so let’s round that down to $3 million and we have $7 million in new rental.
So you have $10 million in same-store new revenue that's somewhere around a 47% expense ratio. So we should be able to bring plenty of new income to the bottom line and then as the Board we’ll have to discuss, do you believe you need of cushion in FFO over your dividend or can you dividend be with same as your FFO. But to me there's no question, the FFO per share is going to increase and we're going to be able to make that choice.
And I'd add to that fact, UMH substantially increases the value of properties we own and we have almost $1 billion in assets with only 30 million shares outstanding. So the increased value in the appreciation I mean something's got to be done with that and that's got to go somewhere, so let's - or something to discuss.
Michael Boulgaris
Thank you for that color, and I’ll jump back into queue.
Samuel Landy
Thank you.

The next question comes from Chris Reynolds of Neuberger Berman. Please go ahead.
Chris Reynolds
Good morning, gentlemen.
Samuel Landy
Hi, there.
Chris Reynolds
I have a general question about the acquisitions that you've made. You've been very proactive and grown the Company rapidly. But I would think that there might be some or a surplus real estate that perhaps could be monetized that might be more suitable to another developer or - and you could free up some cash. I think I'm wondering if that's a possibility or whether everything that you've acquired will be put in operation as you envisioned?
Eugene Landy
I seldom sell anything and over the years, we've seen that we hold on to the parks and they go up and value tremendously. We take a much longer term view than most companies. We see that the population of the United States is growing maybe by as much as 3 million a year as there was inflation.
The areas we are in are excellent and I really don't know of any parks that we would consider selling. On top of that you have to understand, we have an excellent business plan to monetize the increase in value as long as we have this Freddie Mac program. We will have the private investors with collateralized mortgages.
We are able if we can increase the value of our parks go back in three, four, five years later and refinance our parks. And we've done that successfully and Anna has done a wonderful job of that and have relationship with the lenders are excellent and some of the lending programs are tremendous programs, but it does take a while. You have to fill the park, turn the income around, increase the income and then go back in and get a new mortgage.
And when you get the new mortgage you have an awful lot of cash. We are buying our rental units. We've invested as much as over $150 million in rental units. And we've done that to the preferred stock to refinancing and as we see it two, three years from now we're going to refinance a lot of our products and generate an awful lot of cash. So we see no reason to try to generate cash by selling off our assets.
Samuel Landy
I just want to point out. We are in the process of - we're being approached about Marcellus Shale leases again where people will pay us per acre for drilling rigs and then you get a percentage. We are getting approvals for additional sub storage units on our vacant land and expect to increase our number of sub storage units to a 1,000 units in the next three years.

And we do look at the vacant land constantly to look at the best vacant land in terms of its highest and best use. And we wouldn't be opposed to - we have a piece across from our hospitals that might be a good piece to build a medical office. So we look at that and we consider what to do with it, but at this time the vacant land is sitting there.
Chris Reynolds
Okay. Well, terrific. Keep up the good work. Very impressive results.
Samuel Landy
Thank you.
Eugene Landy
Thank you.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 – Review
0 
by Samuel Landy in Reviews  — 16 Nov, 2015  



Review of: Call of Duty: Black Ops 3Product by: Samuel LandyReviewed by: Samuel LandyRating:8On 16 November, 2015Last modified:19 April, 2016Summary:Black Ops 3 is an incredible Call of Duty game and may just be the best yet. It distances itself from previous entries with the risks it takes and it pays off. The three year gap between games from Treyarch has worked in their favour.More Details
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is the direct sequel to developer Treyarch’s Black Ops 2 from 2012. In the 3 years between releases a lot has happened with the Call of Duty franchise. Infinity Ward, fellow developer of the sibling Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series imploded, Sledgehammer Games then came on board co-developing Modern Warfare 3 and eventually going on to develop Advanced Warfare propelling the series into the future and a science fiction setting. What does this mean for Black Ops 3? As ever, Treyarch have thrown content upon content into the game, giving it extreme value for money. Its campaign is a departure in its execution, multiplayer is as frenetic as ever, zombie’s returns in all its glory and there are a few extra additions to surprise the player with.
The campaign is substantial by Call of Duty standards, and runs just over six hours. It deals with what happens to humans when robotics are left unchecked, and paints a rather scary picture of a possible future. Here we come across several of the new innovations to the franchise. At the beginning you are asked to create a character, you can choose your gender for the first time in the series history, and also choose from several different faces to give your character minimal customization. It’s not on the level of Bloodborne, but it is a nice touch that adds to the level of investment usually not present in the games campaign. From here you start your standard run-and-gun mission, running through a level and dispatching a lot of bad guys trying to get to the end of the level. At the end of the level you find yourself in circumstances that leave you in a state that requires the character to upgrade his (or her) body with robotics, setting the player up for the rest of the story. While previous Black Ops games have dealt with drugs, brainwashing, MK-Ultra and trippy hallucinations, Black Ops 3 deals with what happens when the human mind is integrated with the direct neural interface that controls the robotics, achieving a similar effect.

On the gameplay side of things once you get past the initial stages, you are set up in a hub world. Here you can choose your load out, select the next mission from several different choices and play around with the new cyber cores. These cyber cores regulate what powers the player has going into the next mission. They are divided into three types, control, martial and chaos. Control focuses on hacking, whether it be enemy robots and drones or turrets and computers. Martial supercharges the player melee combat, giving additional powers that help the player get up close and personal in a fight and rip apart the enemy. Chaos deals with what the game terms ‘psychological warfare,’ turning and using the enemies gear against them. While this gives more depth and thought to the missions the choice is incredibly important because the player usually won’t have enough points to level up all three cores, and once you’ve chosen your core you’re locked in for that mission.
The same applies to weapons. Weapons in Black Ops 3 are registered to a single individual and can only be used by that one person. Choice is paramount. My preferred core was Martial as it was equipped with abilities that dealt with both robotic and human enemies evenly. That being said, the issue of being locked into a specific loadout is easily addressed if you have friends to play with. Campaign can be played co-operatively with up to three other friends, meaning that each of you can play a different role depending on the cyber core chosen. In a lot of instances co-op felt like it was the preferred option, as the levels are rather large and long and it can become monotonous fighting waves of enemies by yourself. Once the campaign is finished a zombie’s version of the campaign is unlocked. It’s a fun, quirky take on the main story but in end isn’t as well fleshed out as it could have been.

Multiplayer is where Black Ops 3 really shines. From the onset the player will recognise change. You are asked to pick a specialist to play as, each specialist is different in that they have one unique power and weapon that you must choose from. It is these unique powers and weapons that make each specialist different, otherwise they play exactly the same. One is a crack shot archer, the other can get a speed boost while another can equip a shock rifle. It never feels uneven because everyone has access to some type of power in the game.  The Pick-10 system is back and for the better. The Pick-10 system allots the player ten points from which they can assign different weapon attachments, grenades, perks and so on. This, complemented with the powers of the specialists, gives a very even handed feel to multiplayer.
On top of this there is a whole new level of manoeuvrability that adds to the chaos of the already frantic multiplayer. The thruster pack is now restricted, usually to two jumps or a combination of power slide and jump before it needs to recharge. What you get instead is the ability to fire your weapon whenever you want. You can fire it power sliding, you can fire it jumping, you can fire it running, whether on the ground or along the walls. That’s right, Black Ops 3 now allows the player to run along walls. Standard game modes return such as team deathmatch, capture the flag and domination as well as some fan favourites such as kill confirmed and uplink but the noted absences of moshpit is a shame. While Call of Duty multiplayer has become known for twelve year olds screaming obscenities through a mic at people, the multiplayer is balanced and fine tuned to the point where it is easily addictive. Multiplayer in Black Ops 3 just feels right, it takes the ideas that were present in Advanced Warfare and pushes them to the extreme.

Zombies is back as well, and in much better form than what passed for the game mode in Advanced Warfare. This time the players take the roles of four citizens from Morg city. The characters are played by Ron Perlman, Heather Graham, Neal McDonough and Jeff Goldblum and the actors do an excellent job of bringing them to life in the way that they interact with each other and the world around them. There is a complete levelling system, which works much better than it did in Black Ops 2, as well as the ability to upgrade guns that you’ll find on the wall and pick your perk load out. In the small, confined streets of Morg city it is easy to get corned and beaten down by Zombies, but a good team who works together can chop through them and get to the higher levels.
Also making a return is Dead Ops Arcade, which is hidden somewhere within the campaign. It plays much the same as the original but, like everything in Black Ops 3, ups the ante. It’s bigger and longer, adding new pick-ups and weapons to help battle the new Cosmic Silverback. Another addition to the package is the Free Run mode. This allows the player to run through speed trials using the new manoeuvrability system of the game. It also acts as a good training simulator for the multiplayer, helping you to practise those tricky moves.

All in all, Black Ops 3 is an incredible Call of Duty game and may just be the best yet. It distances itself from previous entries with the risks it takes and it pays off. The three year gap between games from Treyarch has worked in their favour. They have crafted an engaging campaign with its playability, the multiplayer is tight as ever and zombies is returned to its former glory. This is definitely worth the bang for the buck. Now if you excuse me, I’ve got to shoot some zombies.
 
Rating: 8/10
