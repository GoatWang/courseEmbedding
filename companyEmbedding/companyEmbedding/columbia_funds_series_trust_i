1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Columbia Funds Series Trust I


Table of Contents
Filed pursuant to Rule 497(e); 
File no. 2-99356 


Table of Contents


Supplement 
dated March 10, 2017
to 
each of the following Statements of Additional Information (each an SAI and 
collectively the SAIs):




SAI 
SAI Dated 

Columbia Funds Series Trust I 
3/10/2017 

Columbia Funds Series Trust and Columbia Funds Series 
      Trust II 
3/1/2017 
Effective 
on or about March 27, 2017, shares held by Class I shareholders will be 
exchanged for Class Y shares of the same Fund in a tax-free transaction with no 
impact on the fees and expenses paid by shareholders and Class I shares of the 
Funds will no longer be offered for sale. Therefore, effective on or about March 
27, 2017, all information regarding Class I shares is hereby deleted from each 
SAI. In addition, effective April 10, 2017, Appendix S to each SAI is hereby 
superseded and replaced with the information in this Supplement.
APPENDIX 
S — MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHOOSING A SHARE CLASS
The 
Fund’s prospectus contains information relative to choosing a share class. The 
information in this Appendix S should be read in conjunction with the 
information contained in the prospectus. With regard to any sales charge waivers 
and discounts described in this Appendix S and the prospectus, it is your 
obligation to advise your financial intermediary or (in the case of 
Direct-at-Fund Accounts, as defined in the prospectus) the Transfer Agent that 
you qualify for any waiver or reduced sales change and be prepared to provide 
proof thereof.
Class 
Y — Historical Changes to Share Class Eligibility
Current 
Class Y eligibility is disclosed in the Fund’s prospectus, as supplemented (as 
the case may be). The following is certain historical information with respect 
to Class Y shares:
Prior 
to November 8, 2012, Class Y shares were offered only to certain former 
shareholders of series of the former Columbia Funds Institutional Trust 
(together, Former CFIT Shareholders). Former CFIT Shareholders who opened and 
funded a Class Y account with a Fund as of the close of business on November 7, 
2012 may continue to make additional purchases of Class Y shares even if they do 
not satisfy the current eligibility requirements but may not establish new Class 
Y shares accounts and will not be eligible to exchange Class Y shares of a Fund 
into Class Y shares of other Funds. Former CFIT Shareholders may exchange Class 
Y shares of a Fund for Class Z shares of the same Fund or Class Z shares of 
another Fund, subject to applicable minimum investments.
Certain 
Historical Changes to Share Class Names

Deferred Sales Charge Waivers (Class A, Class C, Class E and Class V

      Class A shares of a fund initially purchased by an employee benefit plan; 
    

SUP915_00_022_(03/17)

■ 
    
Other 
      than Class A shares of a fund initially purchased by an employee benefit 
      plan that are not connected with a plan level termination; 

■ 
    
In 
      connection with the fund’s Small Account Policy (as described in the 
      prospectus); and 

■ 
    
At 
      a fund’s discretion, issued in connection with plans of reorganization, 
      including but not limited to mergers, asset acquisitions and exchange 
      offers, to which the fund is a party. 
Restrictions 
may apply to certain accounts and certain transactions. The Distributor may, in 
its sole discretion, authorize the waiver of the CDSC for additional classes of 
investors. The Fund may change or cancel these terms at any time. Any change or 
cancellation applies only to future purchases.
Class 
Z Shares Additional Eligible Investors
In 
addition to the categories of Class Z investors described in the Fund’s 
prospectus (other than for the Multi-Manager Strategies Funds), the minimum 
initial investments in Class Z shares are as follows:
The 
minimum initial investment in Class Z shares for the following categories of 
eligible investors is $2,000 ($1,000 for IRAs, as applicable):




■ 
    
Any 
      client of Bank of America or one of its subsidiaries buying shares through 
      an asset management company, trust, fiduciary, retirement plan 
      administration or similar arrangement with Bank of America or the 
      subsidiary. 

■ 
    
Any 
      employee (or family member of an employee) of Bank of America or one of 
      its subsidiaries. 

■ 
    
Any 
      investor buying shares through a Columbia Management state tuition plan 
      organized under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

■ 
    
Any 
      trustee or director (or family member of a trustee or director) of a fund 
      distributed by the Distributor. 
As 
described in the prospectuses, any shareholder (as well as any family member of 
a shareholder or person listed on an account registration for any account of the 
shareholder) of another fund distributed by the Distributor who holds Class Z 
shares is eligible to purchase Class Z shares subject to a minimum initial 
investment of $2,000. If the account in which the shareholder holds Class Z 
shares is not eligible to purchase additional Class Z shares, the shareholder 
may purchase Class Z shares in an account maintained directly with the Transfer 
Agent, subject to the $2,000 minimum for such direct account.
Class 
B Shares — Conversion to Class A Shares
Class 
B shares purchased in a series of CFST, CFST I or CFST II (other than Class B 
shares purchased in a former Seligman Fund on or prior to June 12, 2009) 
automatically convert to Class A shares after you’ve owned the shares for eight 
years, except for Class B shares of Columbia Short Term Municipal Bond Fund, 
which do not convert to Class A shares. Class B shares originally purchased in a 
former Seligman Fund on or prior to June 12, 2009 will convert to Class A shares 
in the month prior to the ninth year of ownership. The conversion feature allows 
you to benefit from the lower operating costs of Class A shares, which can help 
increase your total returns from an investment in the fund.
The 
following rules apply to the conversion of Class B shares to Class A 
shares:




■ 
    
Class 
      B shares are converted on or about the 15th day of the month that they 
      become eligible for conversion. For purposes of determining the month when 
      your Class B shares are eligible for conversion, the start of the holding 
      period is the first day of the month in which your purchase was made. 
  

■ 
    
Any 
      shares you received from reinvested distributions on these shares 
      generally will convert to Class A shares at the same time. 

■ 
    
You’ll 
      receive the same dollar value of Class A shares as the Class B shares that 
      were converted. Class B shares that you received from an exchange of Class 
      B shares of another fund will convert based on the day you bought the 
      original shares. 

■ 
    
No 
      sales charge or other charges apply, and conversions are free from U.S. 
      federal income tax. 
Class 
F Shares — Conversion to Class E Shares*
The 
following rules apply to the conversion of Class F shares to Class E 
shares:




■ 
    
Class 
      F shares are converted on or about the 15th day of the month that they 
      become eligible for conversion. For purposes of determining the month when 
      your Class F shares are eligible for conversion, the start of the holding 
      period is the first day of the month in which your purchase was made. 
  

■ 
    
Any 
      shares you received from reinvested distributions on these shares 
      generally will convert to Class E shares at the same time. 

■ 
    
You’ll 
      receive the same dollar value of Class E shares as the Class F shares that 
      were converted. Class F shares that you received from an exchange of Class 
      F shares of another Fund will convert based on the day you bought the 
      original shares.

■ 
    
No 
      sales charge or other charges apply, and conversions are free from U.S. 
      federal income tax. 





* 
    
The 
      Funds no longer accept investments from new or existing investors in Class 
      E or Class F shares, except by existing Class E and/ or Class F 
      shareholders who opened and funded their account prior to September 22, 
      2006 that may continue to invest in Class E and/or Class F shares. See the 
      prospectus offering Class E and Class F shares of Large Cap Growth Fund 
      for details. 
Shares 
of Multi-Manager Strategies Funds
The 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds offer 
Class A shares and Class Z shares that are available only through certain wrap 
fee programs sponsored and/or managed by Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates. 
The minimum initial investment for Class A shares and Class Z shares of the 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds is $100, 
and each share class has no minimum additional investment. Shares of the 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds are not 
subject to any front-end sales charge or CDSC. See the Fund’s prospectus for 
additional information.
Fund 
Reorganizations
Class 
A shares may be issued without any initial sales charge in connection with the 
acquisition of cash and securities owned by other investment companies. Any CDSC 
will be waived in connection with the redemption of shares of the fund if the 
fund is combined with another fund or in connection with a similar 
reorganization transaction.
Rejection 
of Purchases
Each 
fund and the distributor of the funds reserve the right to reject any offer to 
purchase shares, in their sole discretion.
Restrictions 
and Changes in Terms and Conditions
Restrictions 
may apply to certain accounts and certain transactions. The Funds and/or the 
Distributor may change or cancel these terms and conditions at any time. Unless 
you provide your financial intermediary with information in writing about all of 
the factors that may count toward available reductions or waivers of an 
applicable sales charge, there can be no assurance that you will receive all of 
the reductions and waivers for which you may be eligible. To the extent your 
Fund account is held directly with the Fund, you should provide this information 
to the Fund when placing your purchase or redemption order. Please see the 
Fund’s prospectus for more information about sales charge reductions and 
waivers.
Shareholders 
should retain this Supplement for future reference.

3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
