The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                “The Rivet Pants are super tough, thanks to the nylon canvas material (they feel like they could take a more serious beating than I’m capable of givin’); versatile enough that I’ve worn them on an overnight international flight, through the next day, then paired them with a blazer for dinner. – Nick Caruso, Associate Editor”

                “Plenty of useful features, while still looking classic.”

                “There’s perhaps not a pair of pants like it on the market, and that should make them worthy of your purchase alone.”
