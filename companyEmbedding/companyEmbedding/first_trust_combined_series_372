How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Amazon.com Inc. has always been the ultimate long-term play for shareholders, given that the company has prioritized expansion at the expense of immediate profit. But even by those standards, it's a pricey bet.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

____________

(1) Because certain of the Securities may, in certain circumstances, be
sold, redeemed or mature in accordance with their terms, the Unit value
at the Termination Date may not equal the Principal Amount (Par Value)
of Securities per Unit stated above.

(2)The Public Offering Price shown above reflects the value of the
Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit. No
investor will purchase Units at this price. The price you pay for your
Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the
date you purchase your Units. On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Public
Offering Price per Unit will not include any accrued interest on the
Securities. After this date, a pro rata share of any accrued interest on
the Securities will be included.

(3)You will pay a maximum sales charge of 3.95% of the Public Offering
Price per Unit (equivalent to 4.112% of the net amount invested).
Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their
Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs.

(4) Each Security is valued at its aggregate offering price. The initial
evaluation for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption
price of Units on the Initial Date of Deposit will occur at the latter
of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or the effectiveness of the Trust. Thereafter,
evaluations for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption
price of Units are made as of the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day on
which it is open (the "Evaluation Time").

(5) The Net Asset Value per Unit figure reflects the deduction of
estimated organization costs, which will be deducted from the assets of
the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. The Sponsor's
Initial Repurchase Price per Unit does not reflect the deduction of
estimated organization costs until the end of the initial offering
period as set forth under "Fee Table." The Redemption Price per Unit
reflects the deduction of such estimated organization costs. See
"Redeeming Your Units."

(6)See "Amending or Terminating the Indenture."

(7) Distributions will be paid on the twenty-fifth day of each month
("Distribution Date") to Unit holders of record on the tenth day of such
month ("Distribution Record Date"). The amount of the Estimated Regular
Distributions per Unit was calculated on the basis of the Estimated
Annual Interest Income per Unit less the estimated annual expenses and
divided by twelve. Each Unit holder will receive the Initial
Distribution per Unit on _________, 2011. Estimated Regular
Distributions per Unit will occur monthly, beginning ________, 2011. The
actual distribution you receive will vary from that set forth above with
changes in the Trust's fees and expenses and with the sale, maturity or
redemption of Securities. See "Fee Table" and "Expenses and Charges."
Distributions from the Principal Account will be made monthly if the
amount available for distribution equals at least $1.00 per Unit.
Notwithstanding, distributions of funds in the Principal Account, if
any, will be made in December of each year and as part of the final
liquidation distribution. See "Interest and Principal Distributions."

(8) Estimated Current Return is calculated by dividing Estimated Net
Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. Estimated
Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula which (1) factors in the
relative weightings of the market values, yields (which take into
account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and
estimated retirements of the Securities; and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor, the sales charge and expenses. There is no assurance
that the Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns set forth above will be
realized in the future because the various components used to calculate
these figures, such as Trust expenses, market values and estimated
retirements of the Securities, will change. In addition, neither rate
reflects the true return you will receive, which will be lower, because
neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions.

Fee Table



This Fee Table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you
buy and hold Units of the Trust and receive distributions monthly. See
"Public Offering" and "Expenses and Charges." Although the Trust has a
term of approximately ___ years and is a unit investment trust rather
than a mutual fund, this information allows you to compare fees.

                                 Example

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in
the Trust with the cost of investing in other investment products. The
example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Trust for the periods
shown. The example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year
and that the Trust's operating expenses stay the same. The example does
not take into consideration transaction fees which may be charged by
certain broker/dealers for processing redemption requests. Although your
actual costs may vary, based on these assumptions your costs, assuming
you sell or redeem your Units at the end of each period, would be:

1 Year             3 Years            5 Years            10 Years
______             _______            _______            _______
$                  $                  $                  $

The example will not differ if you hold rather than sell your Units at
the end of each period.

____________

(a)The maximum sales charge consists entirely of an initial sales
charge, deducted at the time of purchase. Investors will not be assessed
a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash
deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs.

(b) Estimated organization costs will be deducted from the assets of the
Trust at the end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization
costs are assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a
percentage of average net assets, will vary over time.

(c)Each of the fees listed herein is assessed on a fixed dollar amount
per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary
over time.

(d)Other operating expenses include the costs incurred for annually
updating the Trust's registration statement, but do not include
brokerage costs and other portfolio transaction fees. A portion of the
Trustee's fee represents the cost to the Trustee of advancing funds to
the Trust to meet scheduled distributions, to provide funds for payment
of redemptions, or otherwise as required for the administration of the
Trust. The Trustee can adjust the amount of its fee in response to,
among other things, changes in short term interest rates and changes in
the average cash balances on hand in the Trust Accounts. In certain
circumstances the Trust may incur additional expenses not set forth
above. See "Expenses and Charges."

_____________

                    NOTES TO STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS

The Sponsor is responsible for the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States which require the Sponsor to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported herein. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(1) The Trust invests in a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal
bonds. Aggregate cost of the Securities listed under "Schedule of
Investments" is based on their aggregate underlying value. The Trust has
a Termination Date of ________, 20__.

(2) An irrevocable letter of credit issued by The Bank of New York
Mellon, of which $_________ is allocated to the Trust, has been
deposited with the Trustee as collateral, covering the monies necessary
for the purchase of Securities subject to purchase contracts ($   ),
accrued interest to the Initial Date of Deposit ($   ), cash ($   ) and
accrued interest from the Initial Date of Deposit to the later of the
First Settlement Date of the Trust or the expected dates of delivery of
the Securities ($   ). The Trustee will advance to the Trust the amount
of net interest accrued to the First Settlement Date, which will be
distributed to the Sponsor as Unit holder of record.

(3) The purchased interest on the underlying Securities accrued to the
Initial Date of Deposit will be distributed to the Sponsor as Unit
holder of record.

(4) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount
sufficient to reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of
establishing the Trust. These costs have been estimated at $    per
Unit. A payment will be made at the end of the initial offering period
to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the obligation of the
investors to the Sponsor will be satisfied. To the extent that actual
organization costs are greater than the estimated amount, only the
estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be
reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust.

(5) Net asset value per Unit is calculated by dividing the Trust's net
assets by the number of Units outstanding. This figure includes
organization costs, which will only be assessed to Units outstanding at
the close of the initial offering period.

(6) The aggregate cost to investors in the Trust, excluding the amount
held in cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs, includes a
maximum sales charge computed at the rate of 3.95% of the Public
Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 4.112% of the net amount
invested), assuming no reduction of sales charge as set forth under
"Public Offering."

                    NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

(1) All Securities are represented by the actual Securities and/or
regular way contracts to purchase such Securities which are backed by an
irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the Trustee. The Sponsor
entered into purchase contracts for the Securities on August __, 2011,
and the Sponsor expects that any outstanding purchase contracts as of
August __, 2011 will settle on or prior to August __, 2011. The
Securities are obligations of issuers of certain states or United States
territories. The Securities in the Trust are divided by source of
revenue and represent the percentage of net assets as indicated by the
following table:

Number of Issues        Source of Revenue                  Portfolio Percentage
________________        ________________                   ____________________
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %

(2) The cost of the Securities to the Trust represents the aggregate
underlying value with respect to the Securities acquired (generally
determined by the aggregate offering price of the Securities at the
opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit). The evaluation of
the Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit
has been determined by Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.,
an independent pricing agent. The cost of the Securities to the Sponsor
and the Sponsor's profit or loss (which is the difference between the cost
of the Securities to the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the
Trust) are $    and $   , respectively. The cost of the Securities to
the Sponsor may include the cost of and gain or loss on certain futures
contracts entered into by the Sponsor in an effort to hedge the impact
of interest rate fluctuations on the value of certain of the Securities
to the extent the Sponsor entered into such contracts. The aggregate bid
price of the Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date
of Deposit was $    (unaudited).

(3) The ratings are by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, a division of
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P" or "Standard & Poor's") and are
unaudited. Such ratings were obtained from an information reporting
service other than S&P. "NR" indicates no rating by S&P. Such Securities
may, however, be rated by another nationally recognized statistical
rating organization. "(e)" indicates an "Expected Rating" and is
intended to anticipate Standard & Poor's forthcoming rating assignment.
Expected Ratings are generated by Bloomberg Finance L.P. ("Bloomberg")
based on sources it considers reliable or established Standard & Poor's
rating practices. Expected Ratings exist only until Standard & Poor's
assigns a rating to the issue. There is no guarantee that the ratings,
when assigned, will not differ from those currently expected.

(4) Certain Securities may be redeemed before their stated maturity.
This column shows when a Security is initially redeemable and the
redemption price for that year. Securities are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. S.F. indicates a
sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Securities.
Certain Securities may also be redeemed in whole or in part other than
by operation of the stated redemption provisions under certain
circumstances detailed in the instruments creating them. Such redemption
provisions may result in a redemption price less than the value of the
Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit. Redemption pursuant to call
provisions generally will occur at times when the redeemed Securities
have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par. To
the extent that Securities were deposited in the Trust at a price higher
than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of
capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the
Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the
income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed
Securities and Unit holders will receive a distribution of the principal
amount and any premium received on such redemption (except to the extent
the proceeds of the redeemed Securities are used to pay for Unit
redemptions). Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return
may also be affected by such redemptions.

(5) In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 ("ASC
820"), "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," fair value is defined
as the price that the Trust would receive upon selling an investment in
a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most
advantageous market of the investment. ASC 820 established a three-tier
hierarchy to maximize the use of the observable market data and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of the
fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, including the technique or pricing model used to measure
fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation
technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained
from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs
are inputs that may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the
three broad levels: Level 1 which represents quoted prices in active
markets for identical investments; Level 2 which represents fair value
based on other significant observable inputs (including the yield or
price of equivalent securities of comparable quality, coupon rate,
maturity, embedded call features, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other market data available as of the deposit date); and Level 3
which represents fair value based on significant unobservable inputs

Page 10

(including the Trust's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
investments). At the date of deposit, all of the Trust's investments are
classified as Level 2; the valuation on the date of deposit was
determined by the Evaluator using offering prices provided by
third-party pricing services. The inputs used by these third party
pricing services were based upon significant observable inputs, that
included, but were not limited to, the items noted above.

(6)These Securities were issued at an original issue discount on the
following dates and at the following percentages of their original
principal amount:

                                                            Date               %
                                                            ____              _____
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %

(7)Insurance has been obtained by the issuer of this Security. Such
insurance coverage continues in force so long as a Security is
outstanding and the insurer remains in business. See "Risk Factors" in
the prospectus for a discussion of risks of investing in insured
Securities.

(8)This Security has a "make whole" call option and is redeemable in
whole or in part at any time, unless otherwise provided below, at the
option of the issuer, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon,
discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a set premium to the
then current applicable Treasury Rate, plus, in either case, accrued and
unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of
redemption. Securities bearing this option within the Trust and their
respective premiums to the applicable Treasury rate are as follows:
__________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________,
____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%;
__________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________,
____%; __________, ____%.

(9)This Security may be redeemed in whole or in part in the event that
the issuer's cash subsidy payment (either 35% or 45%) from the U.S.
government is reduced or eliminated ("extraordinary redemption"). Such
redemption may result in a redemption price less than the value of the
Security on the Initial Date of Deposit.

The First Trust Combined Series




The First Trust Combined Series Defined.



We, First Trust Portfolios L.P. (the "Sponsor"), have created hundreds
of similar yet separate series of an investment company which we have
named The First Trust Combined Series. The series to which this
prospectus relates, The First Trust Combined Series 376, consists of a
single portfolio known as Build America Bonds Portfolio, Series 39. We
anticipate depositing The First Trust Combined Series 376 on or about
August 23, 2011. However, for a variety of reasons, we may elect to
postpone or cancel the deposit or, if we proceed with the deposit, we
may elect to create fewer Units than we currently anticipate.


The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York by a Trust
Agreement (the "Indenture") dated the Initial Date of Deposit. This
agreement, entered into between First Trust Portfolios L.P., as Sponsor,
The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee, FTP Services LLC ("FTPS") as
FTPS Unit Servicing Agent and First Trust Advisors L.P. as Portfolio
Supervisor and Evaluator, governs the operation of the Trust.


YOU MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS CONCERNING THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND
RISKS OF THIS PRODUCT IN AN "INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT" BY CALLING THE

SPONSOR AT 1-800-621-1675, EXT. 1.



How We Created the Trust.



On the Initial Date of Deposit, we deposited municipal bonds and/or
contracts for municipal bonds (including a letter of credit or the
equivalent) with the Trustee and in turn, the Trustee delivered
documents to us representing our ownership of the Trust, in the form of
units ("Units").


After the Initial Date of Deposit, we may deposit additional Securities
in the Trust, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent)
with instructions to buy more Securities to create new Units for sale.
If we create additional Units, we will attempt, to the extent
practicable, to maintain the percentage relationship established among
the Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit (as set forth under
"Schedule of Investments"), adjusted to reflect the occurrence of an
event which affects the capital structure of the issuer of a Security or
a sale of a Security made as described in "Removing Securities from the
Trust."


Since the prices of the Securities will fluctuate daily, the ratio of
Securities in the Trust, on a market value basis, will also change
daily. The portion of Securities represented by each Unit will not
change as a result of the deposit of additional Securities in the Trust.
If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of
your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate
between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities,
and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this
dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the
Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. In
addition, because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the
creation of new Units and with the sale of Securities to meet redemption
and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will
likely result in higher brokerage expenses.


An affiliate of the Trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the
Trustee may retain and pay us (or our affiliate) to act as agent for the
Trust to buy Securities. If we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to
the Trust, we will be subject to the restrictions under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").


We cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size and
composition for any length of time. Securities will mature or may be
redeemed prior to the Termination Date or may be periodically sold under
certain circumstances to satisfy Trust obligations, to meet redemption
requests and, as described in "Removing Securities from the Trust," to
maintain the sound investment character of the Trust, and the proceeds
received by the Trust will be used to meet Trust obligations or
distributed to Unit holders, but will not be reinvested. However,
Securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or
changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation, or if they
no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected. You will not be
able to dispose of or vote any of the Securities in the Trust. As the
holder of the Securities, the Trustee will vote the Securities and will
endeavor to vote the Securities such that the Securities are voted as
closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion
as are the Securities held by owners other than such Trust.


Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the
Securities. However, if a contract for the purchase of any of the
Securities initially deposited in the Trust fails, unless we can
purchase substitute Securities ("Replacement Securities"), we will
refund to you that portion of the purchase price and sales charge
resulting from the failed contract on the next Distribution Date. Any
Replacement Security the Trust acquires will meet requirements specified
in the Indenture.

Portfolio




Objectives.



The Trust seeks to distribute income and preserve capital by investing
in a professionally selected, fixed portfolio of investment grade
taxable municipal bonds. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the
Trust's portfolio will consist of bonds issued under the Build America
Bond provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
but the Trust may also invest in other taxable municipal bonds.



Build America's Infrastructure with Bonds.



A municipal bond is a debt obligation of a state and/or local government
entity which can be used to help build America's infrastructure by
raising money to finance public projects such as new hospitals, schools
and improved roads. With the signing into law of the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009, an entirely new type of taxable municipal
bond was created-Build America Bonds, or BABs. Essentially, Build
America Bonds are identical to traditional tax-exempt issues except the
interest is taxable at the federal, and possibly state and local level.


BABs provided state and local governments with a new method of financing
capital projects with the aid of a federal subsidy. The subsidy was
intended to ease the burden of budgetary-pressured state and local
governments and to stimulate spending on a variety of public projects.
The federal government reimburses the municipality 35% of the interest
paid on the bonds (45% in the case of certain bonds), thereby reducing
their net interest cost. The subsidy provided by the government allowed
issuers to offer higher interest rates on bonds than they do on their
tax-free debt, while offsetting some or all of the additional financing
burden. The BAB program expired at the end of 2010. There is no
assurance that the BAB program will be continued in the future or, if it
is continued, that the program terms will not be modified, possibly
significantly.



Build America Bonds At-A-Glance:



o Part of the U.S. government's plan to fund infrastructure;


o U.S. government will subsidize 35% (45% in the case of certain bonds)
of the interest payment on taxable bonds issued as direct pay BABs
directly to the issuers of such securities;


o Municipal bonds have historically low default rates and relatively low
volatility;


o Provide taxable income;


o Generally high credit quality;


o Interest will be treated as state tax-exempt in those states that
treat municipal bond interest as exempt from state income tax.



Growth in BAB Issuance.



Increased Demand. Growth in BABs issuance throughout the program's
existence was spurred by investor demand since BABs represented a new
taxable fixed income option for investors to augment corporate, asset-
backed, Federal agency and Treasury bonds. In addition, BABs have drawn
interest from investors who are not typically purchasers of tax-exempt
bonds because they don't benefit from federal tax exemption, such as
foreign investors who have no U.S. tax liability or pension funds that
are not required to pay taxes.


The first BABs were sold on April 15, 2009 and by the end of 2009 a
total of $64.1 billion in BABs were issued. In 2010, another $117.3
billion had been issued. Since 2009, all 50 states and the District of
Columbia have participated in the program. [Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)]


Increased Share of Issuance. States and local governments have always
issued taxable debt, accounting for an average of 7% of overall long-
term issuance since 2000. [Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board] The
emergence of BABs, however, led to record levels of issuance of taxable
municipal securities. [Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board] From the
first BAB issuance on April 15, 2009 through the end of 2009, BABs
accounted for 20% of long-term securities issued in the municipal
market. [SIFMA] In 2010, BAB's share grew to account for 30% of long-
term municipal bond issuance.



The Appeal of Taxable Municipal Bonds.



Lower Default Rates than Corporate Bonds. Municipal bonds have
historically had a very low overall default rate as compared to
corporate bonds. According to data from Moody's, the historical default
rate of Moody's-rated municipal bonds is lower than that of corporate
bonds in every rating category. In fact, despite the economic struggles
facing many states and municipalities, investment grade municipal bonds
have experienced significantly lower default rates than even the highest
rated corporate bonds.


One reason for the historically lower default rates has been due to the
relatively more stable revenue streams of municipalities, which have the
ability to levy taxes to offset declining revenues. Corporate revenues,
on the other hand, can be more volatile as they have fewer ways to
increase revenues during difficult economic periods.


Page 13


Attractive Yields. The subsidy provided by the government enables BAB
issuers to offer yields at attractive spreads over comparable
traditional types of taxable bonds such as Treasury bonds and corporate
bonds. Although the interest on the bonds is taxable for federal
purposes, states are permitted to treat the interest as exempt from
state taxes.


The taxable bond marketplace is often short on supply of longer-dated
taxable bonds, which has made BABs a popular option for both
institutional and individual investors who are attracted to the higher
yields relative to other taxable bonds.

Professional Evaluation and Selection.



We believe thorough analysis of the credit quality of any bond is
critically important in light of the challenges present in the municipal
market today. Relying on a bond's rating does not adequately inform
investors about the inherent credit quality of the bond.


At First Trust we take a thorough approach to analyzing municipal
securities that are under consideration for inclusion in our unit
investment trusts. Our analysts use a multiple factor approach when
evaluating the credit strength of a bond. Factors specific to different
sectors of the municipal market enter into the analysis as well as
comparisons to peers.


To do so, our analysts assess the financial strength of the obligor by
examining its fiscal health and economic health. We determine the
relative strength of protection afforded the bondholder by the legal and
contractual elements of the bond documents. And we look to other
qualitative factors that could enhance or compromise the credit strength
of the bond.


Assessing Municipal Credit Risk. The goal of our credit analysis is
primarily two-fold:


o Avoidance of potentially severe credit impairment, especially default.


o Determining probability of transitional credit events leading to
credit quality volatility or degradation.


Although municipal bonds have exhibited a very low rate of default,
defaults can and do happen. However, it is more common for the credit
quality of a bond to become worse over time-a negative credit
transition. By thoroughly analyzing every bond, we seek to identify and
avoid those bonds that have the potential for adverse credit
developments in the future.


Unlike other fixed income investment alternatives, once a unit
investment trust is established new bonds cannot be added or substituted
for the Trust's holdings. Therefore we approach the analysis of each and
every security with the understanding that they will be held in any
given portfolio for a long period of time. The purpose of our credit
analysis is to identify securities that we believe will stand the test
of time for the duration of the life of the Trust.


As of the Initial Date of Deposit, all of the Securities were rated "BBB-"
or better by Standard & Poor's and/or another nationally recognized
statistical rating organization. See "Description of Bond Ratings."
After the Initial Date of Deposit, a Security's rating may be lowered.
This would not immediately cause the Security to be removed from the
Trust, but may be considered by us in determining whether to direct the
Trustee to dispose of such Security. See "Removing Securities from the
Trust."


The Trust has an expected life of approximately ___ years. A diversified
portfolio helps to offset the risks normally associated with such an
investment, although it does not eliminate them entirely. Of course, as
with any similar investments, there can be no guarantee that the
objectives of the Trust will be achieved. See "Risk Factors" for a
discussion of the risks of investing in the Trust.



Estimated Returns



The Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns set forth in the "Summary of
Essential Information" are estimates and are designed to be comparative
rather than predictive. We cannot predict your actual return, which will
vary with Unit price, how long you hold your investment and with changes
in the portfolio, interest income and expenses. In addition, neither
rate reflects the true return you will receive, which will be lower,
because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions
with respect to when the Securities pay interest and when distributions
are paid by the Trust. Estimated Current Return equals the estimated
annual interest income to be received from the Securities less estimated
annual Trust expenses, divided by the Public Offering Price per Unit


Page 14


(which includes the initial sales charge). Estimated Long-Term Return is
a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of the Trust
and is calculated using a formula which (1) factors in the market
values, yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of the Securities,
and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the sales charge and
expenses. Unlike Estimated Current Return, Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects maturities, discounts and premiums of the Securities in the
Trust. We will provide you with estimated cash flows for the Trust at no
charge upon your request.



Risk Factors



Price Volatility. The Trust invests in municipal bonds. The value of the
Securities will decline with increases in interest rates, not only
because increases in rates generally decrease values, but also because
increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown. An economic slowdown,
or a reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the issuer
being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain
interest and principal payments. The value of the Securities will also
fluctuate with changes in investors' perceptions of an issuer's
financial condition or the general condition of the municipal bond
market, changes in inflation rates or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur.


Because the Trust is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities
in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common
in managed investments. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that
the performance of the Trust will be positive over any period of time or
that you won't lose money. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any
bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.


Interest. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the Securities will
be able to satisfy their interest payment obligations to the Trust over
the life of the Trust.


Current Economic Conditions. The National Bureau of Economic Research
announced that the U.S. economy's recession which began in December 2007
technically ended in June 2009. Despite this announcement, economic
activity remains below average levels, the United States continues to
experience increased unemployment and stock markets remain below pre-
recession levels. The recession began with problems in the housing and
credit markets, many of which were caused by defaults on "subprime"
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, eventually leading to the
failures of some large financial institutions and has negatively
impacted all sectors of the economy. The current economic crisis has
also affected the global economy with European and Asian markets
suffering historic losses. Due to the current state of uncertainty in
the economy, the value of the Securities held by the Trust may be
subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in
performance or perception of the issuers. Extraordinary steps have been
taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to combat
the economic crisis; however, the impact of these measures is not yet
known and cannot be predicted.


The markets for credit instruments, including municipal securities, have
experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the
latter half of 2007. Liquidity in the municipal bond market (the ability
to buy and sell bonds readily) has been reduced. General market
uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances
of sellers and buyers, which in turn have resulted in significant
valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities, including
municipal securities. In addition, during 2008, several major dealers of
municipal bonds exited the market via acquisition or bankruptcy. These
conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to result in, greater
volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price
transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of
uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of
the Trust's Securities uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant
valuation increases or declines in its holdings. During times of reduced
market liquidity, such as at the present, the Trust may not be able to
sell Securities readily at prices reflecting the values at which the
Securities are carried on the Trust's books. Sales of large blocks of
securities by market participants, such as the Trust, that are seeking
liquidity can further reduce security prices in an illiquid market.


In response to the current national economic downturn, governmental cost
burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments.
In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state
legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal
and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such
obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. Issuers
of municipal securities might seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.


On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-
term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America to "AA+"
from "AAA."  In reaching its decision, Standard & Poor's cited the
prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the
related fiscal policy debate and their belief that further near-term


Page 15


progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on
entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on revenues is less likely
than they previously assumed. The impact of the downgrade of the U.S.
long-term sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor's is uncertain, but
will likely lead to increased interest rates and volatility in the short-
term.


Municipal Securities. The Trust invests in taxable municipal bonds.
Municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or political
subdivisions or authorities of states. Municipal bonds are typically
designated as general obligation bonds, which are general obligations of
a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such
entity, or revenue bonds, which are payable from the income of a
specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. Municipal bonds are long-term fixed rate debt
obligations that generally decline in value with increases in interest
rates, when an issuer's financial condition worsens or when the rating
on a bond is decreased. Many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed
prior to their stated maturity, an event which is more likely to occur
when interest rates fall. In such an occurrence, you may not be able to
reinvest the money you receive in other bonds that have as high a yield
or as long a maturity.


The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other
securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more
volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with
greater liquidity. In addition, an issuer's ability to make income
distributions generally depends on several factors including the
financial condition of the issuer and general economic conditions. Any
of these factors may negatively impact the price of municipal bonds held
by the Trust and would therefore impact the price of both the Securities
and the Units. The current economic downturn is negatively affecting
towns, counties and school districts across the nation. In recognition
of this fact, Moody's recently assigned a negative outlook to the
creditworthiness of all local governments in the United States.


Acts of terrorism and any resulting damage may not be covered by
insurance on the bonds. Issuers of the bonds may therefore be at risk of
default due to losses sustained as a result of terrorist activities.


Build America Bonds. Most of the Securities in the Trust are Build
America Bonds. The Build America Bonds market is smaller and less
diverse than the broader municipal securities market.  In addition,
because BABs are a new form of municipal financing and because bonds
issued after December 31, 2010 will not qualify as BABs, it is difficult
to predict the extent to which a market for such bonds will develop,
meaning that BABs may experience greater illiquidity than other types of
municipal securities.


Because issuers of direct pay BABs held in the Trust receive
reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury with respect to interest payments
on the bonds, there is a risk that those municipal issuers will not
receive timely payment from the U.S. Treasury and may remain obligated
to pay the full interest due on direct pay BABs held by the Trust.
Furthermore, it is possible that a municipal issuer may fail to comply
with the requirements to receive the direct pay subsidy or that a future
Congress may terminate the subsidy altogether. In addition, the Internal
Revenue Code contains a general offset rule (the "IRS Offset Rule")
which allows for the possibility that the subsidy payments received by
issuers of the BABs may be subject to offset against amounts owed by
them to the Federal government. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") may audit the agencies issuing BABs and such audits may, among
other things, examine the price at which BABs are initially sold to
investors. If the IRS concludes that a Build America Bond was mispriced
based on its audit, it could disallow a portion or all of the interest
subsidy received by the issuer of the Build America Bond. The IRS Offset
Rule and the disallowance of any interest subsidy as a result of an IRS
audit could potentially adversely affect a BABs issuer's credit rating,
and adversely affect the issuer's ability to repay or refinance BABs.
This, in turn, could adversely affect the ratings and value of the BABs
held by the Trust and the value of the Trust's Units and could impair
the issue's ability to make scheduled interest payments.


Because the BABs program is new, certain aspects of the BABs program may
be subject to additional Federal or state level guidance or subsequent
legislation. For example, the IRS or U.S. Treasury could impose
restriction or limitations on the payments received. Aspects of the BABs
program for which the IRS and U.S. Treasury have solicited public
comment include, but have not been limited to, methods for making direct
payments to issuers, the tax procedural framework for such payments, and
compliance safeguards. It is not known what additional procedures will
be implemented with respect to direct pay BABs, if any, nor is it known
what effect such possible procedures would have on the BABs market.


Insurance Risk. Certain of the Securities in the Trust are covered by
insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds
from insurance companies. The "Schedule of Investments" identifies the
insurer of each Security. Insurance guarantees the timely payment, when
due, of all principal and interest on the insured Securities. Such
insurance is effective so long as the insured Security is outstanding
and the insurer remains in business. Insurance relates only to the
particular Security and not to the Units offered hereby or to their
market value. Insured Securities have received the rating described in
the "Schedule of Investments" by Standard & Poor's in recognition of
such insurance. There can be no assurance that any insurer listed will
be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the
future. Certain significant providers of insurance for municipal


Page 16


securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of
exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality
investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered
extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the
insurers' capital and called into question their continued ability to
perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon
to do so in the future. While an insured municipal security will
typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of
a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or the
market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the
rating of the underlying municipal security will be more relevant and
the value of the municipal security would more closely, if not entirely,
reflect such rating. In such a case, the value of insurance associated
with a municipal security would decline and may not add any value.


Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation and supervision
where they do business by state insurance commissioners who regulate the
standards of solvency which must be maintained, the nature of and
limitations on investments, reports of financial condition, and
requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other
matters. A significant portion of the assets of insurance companies is
required by law to be held in reserve against potential claims on
policies and is not available to general creditors. Although the federal
government does not regulate the business of insurance, federal
initiatives including pension regulation, controls on medical care
costs, minimum standards for no-fault automobile insurance, national
health insurance, tax law changes affecting life insurance companies and
repeal of the antitrust exemption for the insurance business can
significantly impact the insurance business.


Because the insurance on the Securities, if any, will be effective so
long as the Securities are outstanding, such insurance will be taken
into account in determining the market value of the Securities and
therefore, some value attributable to such insurance will be included in
the value of the Units of the Trust. The insurance does not, however,
guarantee the market value of the Securities or of the Units.


Discount Bonds. Discount bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a
market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount on previously
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,
other things being equal.


Original Issue Discount Bonds. ____ of the Securities are considered
original issue discount bonds. These bonds typically pay a lower
interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their
par value. Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the
difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue
price of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued
portion is treated as taxable interest income for Federal income tax
purposes.


Unit holders may receive ordinary income dividends from the Trust if the
Trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount, or
sells bonds at a short term capital gain. In general, the Internal
Revenue Service will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost
of the bond, plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued,
is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond. Any
gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue
discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable
to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is
taxable as ordinary income.


The current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the
present value of its stated redemption price at maturity. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to
increase more slowly in early years and greater increments as the bonds
approach maturity.


The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Premium Bonds. Premium bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a
market premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of such
bonds are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds
issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend
to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face
amount becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus
returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early
redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal
will result in a reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to


Page 17


occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par, or for original issue discount bonds, a
premium over the accreted value. To the extent that the Securities were
deposited in the Fund at a price higher than the price at which they are
redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the
original Public Offering Price of the Units. The Trust may be required
to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity (at their current market
price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order to pay
expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See "Removing
Securities from the Trust" and "Amending or Terminating the Indenture."


Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative
initiatives are proposed which may have a negative impact on the prices
of certain of the municipal bonds represented in the Trust. In addition,
litigation regarding any of the issuers of the municipal bonds, such as
litigation affecting the validity of certain municipal bonds or the
qualification of bonds as Build America Bonds eligible for a federal
subsidy payment, may negatively impact the value of these Securities. We
cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or
pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the
Securities or on the issuers.



Public Offering




The Public Offering Price.



You may buy Units at the Public Offering Price, the price per Unit of
which is comprised of the following:


- The aggregate underlying value of the Securities;


- The amount of any cash in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the
Trust;


- Net interest accrued but unpaid on the Securities after the First
Settlement Date to the date of settlement; and


- The sales charge.


The price you pay for your Units will differ from the amount stated
under "Summary of Essential Information" due to various factors,
including fluctuations in the prices of the Securities, changes in the
value of the Interest and/or Principal Accounts and the accrual of
interest on the Securities.


Although you are not required to pay for your Units until three business
days following your order (the "date of settlement"), you may pay before
then. You will become the owner of Units ("Record Owner") on the date of
settlement if payment has been received. If you pay for your Units
before the date of settlement, we may use your payment during this time
and it may be considered a benefit to us, subject to the limitations of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


Organization Costs. Cash which comprises the portion of the Public
Offering Price intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the
Trust's organization costs (including costs of preparing the
registration statement, the Indenture and other closing documents,
registering Units with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and states, the initial audit of the Trust's statement of net assets,
legal fees and the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee) has been
included in the Trust. The Sponsor will be reimbursed for the Trust's
organization costs at the end of the initial offering period (a
significantly shorter time period than the life of the Trust). To the
extent actual organization costs are less than the estimated amount,
only the actual organization costs will be deducted from the assets of
the Trust.



Accrued Interest.



Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a bond from the last day
it paid interest. Interest on the Securities generally is paid
semiannually, although the Trust accrues such interest daily. Because
the Trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected,
the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to it the
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement. You
will receive the amount, if any, of accrued interest you paid for on the
next distribution date. In addition, if you sell or redeem your Units
you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of accrued
interest from the purchaser of your Units.



Minimum Purchase.



The minimum amount you can purchase of the Trust is generally $1,000
worth of Units ($1,000 if you are purchasing Units for your Individual
Retirement Account or any other qualified retirement plan), but such
amounts may vary depending on your selling firm.



Sales Charges.



Initial Offering Period. The maximum sales charge during the initial
offering period equals 3.95% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to
4.112% of the net amount invested).


Secondary Market. The maximum sales charge during the secondary market
is determined based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity
of each Security in the Trust, but in no event will the secondary market
sales charge exceed 4.80% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to
5.042% of the net amount invested). For purposes of computation,
Securities will be deemed to mature either on their expressed maturity
dates, or an earlier date if: (a) they have been called for redemption


Page 18


or funds have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call
date; or (b) such Securities are subject to a "mandatory tender." The
effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different
sales charge rates will be applied to each of the Securities, in
accordance with the following schedule:








                                           Secondary
                                            Market
Years to Maturity                        Sales Charge
_________________                        ________________
Less than 1                                1.00%
1 but less than 2                          1.50%
2 but less than 3                          2.00%
3 but less than 4                          2.50%
4 but less than 5                          3.00%
5 but less than 6                          3.25%
6 but less than 7                          3.50%
7 but less than 8                          3.75%
8 but less than 9                          4.00%
9 but less than 10                         4.50%
10 or more                                 4.80%











Discounts for Certain Persons.



If you invest at least $100,000 including any proceeds as described
below (except if you are purchasing for "Wrap Fee Accounts" as described
below), the maximum sales charge for the amount of the investment
eligible to receive the reduced sales charge is reduced as follows:






                               The Maximum      Dealer
                               Sales Charge     Concession
If you invest                  will be          per Unit
(in thousands):*               reduced by:      will be:
_________________              ____________     ________
$100 but less than $250        $2.50            $27.50
$250 but less than $500        $5.00            $25.00
$500 but less than $1,000      $8.00            $22.50
$1,000 but less than $5,000    $10.00           $21.00
$5,000 or more                 $21.00           $10.00








* The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase
orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the
requirement that only whole Units be issued.


The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases will apply only to
purchases made by the same person on any one day from any one dealer. To
help you reach the above levels, you can combine same day purchases of
Units of the Trust with any other same day purchases of other trusts for
which we are Principal Underwriter and are currently in the initial
offering period. In addition, we will also consider Units you purchase
in the name of your spouse or child under 21 years of age to be
purchases by you. The reduced sales charge will also apply to a trustee
or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust estate or single
fiduciary account including pension, profit sharing or employee benefit
plans, as well as multiple-employee benefit plans of a single employer
or affiliated employers (provided they are not aggregated with personal
accounts). You must inform your dealer of any combined purchases before
the sale in order to be eligible for the reduced sales charge.


Investors purchasing Units through registered broker/dealers who charge
periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for financial
planning, investment advisory or asset management services or provide
these or comparable services as part of an investment account where a
comprehensive "wrap fee" or similar charge is imposed ("Wrap Fee
Accounts") can purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the
applicable dealer concession. Certain Wrap Fee Accounts Unit holders may
be assessed transaction or other account fees on the purchase and/or
redemption of such Units by their broker/dealer or other processing
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.
Wrap Fee Accounts Units are not available for purchase in the secondary
market. We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of Units not
subject to the transactional sales charge by investors whose frequent
trading activity we determine to be detrimental to the Trust.


Employees, officers and directors (and immediate family members) of the
Sponsor, our related companies and dealers may purchase Units at the
Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. Immediate
family members include spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,
grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law,
daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, and trustees,
custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons.


The Sponsor and certain dealers may establish a schedule where
employees, officers and directors of such dealers can purchase Units of
the Trust at the Public Offering Price less the established schedule
amount, which is designed to compensate such dealers for activities
relating to the sale of Units (the "Employee Dealer Concession").



The Value of the Securities.



The Evaluator will appraise the aggregate underlying value of the
Securities in the Trust as of the Evaluation Time on each business day
and will adjust the Public Offering Price of the Units according to this
valuation. This Public Offering Price will be effective for all orders
received before the Evaluation Time on each such day. If we or the
Trustee receive orders for purchases, sales or redemptions after that
time, or on a day which is not a business day, they will be held until
the next determination of price. The term "business day" as used in this
prospectus will exclude Saturdays, Sundays and holidays on which the
NYSE is closed.


The aggregate underlying value of the Securities in the Trust will be
determined as follows:


Page 19


a) On the basis of current market offering prices for the Securities
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds
comparable to those held by the Trust;


b) If such prices are not available for any of the Securities, on the
basis of current market offering prices of comparable bonds;


c) By determining the value of the Securities on the offering side of
the market by appraisal; or


d) By any combination of the above.


After the initial offering period is over, the aggregate underlying
value of the Securities will be determined as set forth above, except
that bid prices are used instead of ask prices when necessary. The
offering price of the Securities may be expected to be greater than
their bid price by approximately 1-3% of the aggregate principal amount
of such Securities.



Distribution of Units



We intend to qualify Units of the Trust for sale in a number of states.
All Units will be sold at the current Public Offering Price.


The Sponsor compensates intermediaries, such as broker/dealers and
banks, for their activities that are intended to result in sales of
Units of the Trust. This compensation includes dealer concessions
described in the following section and may include additional
concessions and other compensation and benefits to broker/dealers and
other intermediaries.



Dealer Concessions.



Dealers and other selling agents can purchase Units at prices which
represent a concession or agency commission of $30.00 per Unit (80% of
the maximum sales charge for secondary market sales), subject to the
reduced concession applicable to volume purchases as set forth in
"Public Offering-Discounts for Certain Persons."


Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents who sell at least
$250,000 worth of Units will be entitled to the following additional
concessions with respect to total sales:

$1,000 or more                               $2.00








Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units of the Trust to
other broker/dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price per
Unit less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the
underwriter concession allowed to the Underwriters by the Sponsor as
described under "Underwriting Concessions" below. In addition, dealers
and other selling agents may sell Units of the Trust to other
broker/dealers and other selling agents at the Public Offering Price
less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the dealer
concessions set forth above.


In addition, eligible dealer firms and other selling agents who, during
the previous consecutive 12-month period through the end of the most
recent month, sold primary market units of unit investment trusts
sponsored by us in the dollar amounts shown below will be entitled to
the following additional sales concession on primary market sales of
units during the current month of unit investment trusts sponsored by us:








Total Sales                               Additional

Dealers and other selling agents will not receive a concession on the
sale of Wrap Fee Account Units, but such Units will be included in
determining whether the above volume sales levels are met. Eligible
dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing firms that place
orders with First Trust and provide First Trust with information with
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible
dealer firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely
provide clearing services to other broker/dealer firms or firms who
place orders through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We
reserve the right to change the amount of concessions or agency
commissions from time to time. Certain commercial banks may be making
Units of the Trust available to their customers on an agency basis. A
portion of the sales charge paid by these customers is kept by or given
to the banks in the amounts shown above.

Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker/Dealers.



The Sponsor, at its own expense and out of its own profits, currently
provides additional compensation and benefits to broker/dealers who sell
shares of Units of this Trust and other First Trust products. This
compensation is intended to result in additional sales of First Trust
products and/or compensate broker/dealers and financial advisors for
past sales. A number of factors are considered in determining whether to
pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include, but are not
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary,
the level or expected level of sales of First Trust products by the
intermediary or its agents, the placing of First Trust products on a
preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary's
personnel, and other factors. The Sponsor makes these payments for
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited
to, expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers,
advertising, sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information
about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediary's
representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in broker/dealer firms
and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the Sponsor's
products. The Sponsor makes such payments to a substantial majority of
intermediaries that sell First Trust products. The Sponsor may also make
certain payments to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion
of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating Unit sales, such
as the costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process Unit
trades. Payments of such additional compensation described in this and
the preceding paragraph, some of which may be characterized as "revenue
sharing," may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their
agents to sell or recommend a First Trust product, including the Trust,
over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies. These
arrangements will not change the price you pay for your Units.



Advertising and Investment Comparisons.



Advertising materials regarding the Trust may discuss several topics,
including: developing a long-term financial plan; working with your
financial professional; the nature and risks of various investment
strategies and unit investment trusts that could help you reach your
financial goals; the importance of discipline; how the Trust operates;
how securities are selected; various unit investment trust features such
as convenience and costs; and options available for certain types of
unit investment trusts. These materials may include descriptions of the
principal businesses of the companies represented in the Trust, research
analysis of why they were selected and information relating to the
qualifications of the persons or entities providing the research
analysis. In addition, they may include research opinions on the economy
and industry sectors included and a list of investment products
generally appropriate for pursuing those recommendations.


From time to time we may compare the estimated returns of the Trust
(which may show performance net of the expenses and charges the Trust
would have incurred) and returns over specified periods of other similar
trusts we sponsor in our advertising and sales materials, with (1)
returns on other taxable investments such as the common stocks
comprising various market indexes, corporate or U.S. Government bonds,
bank CDs and money market accounts or funds, (2) performance data from
Morningstar Publications, Inc. or (3) information from publications such
as Money, The New York Times, U.S. News and World Report, Bloomberg
Businessweek, Forbes or Fortune. The investment characteristics of the
Trust differ from other comparative investments. You should not assume
that these performance comparisons will be representative of the Trust's
future performance. We may also, from time to time, use advertising
which classifies trusts or portfolio securities according to
capitalization and/or investment style.



Underwriting Concessions



The Agreement Among Underwriters provides that a public offering of the
Units of each Trust will be made at the Public Offering Price described
in the prospectus. Units may also be sold to or through dealers and
other selling agents during the initial offering period and in the
secondary market at prices representing a concession or agency
commission as described in "Distribution of Units."


The Sponsor will receive from the Underwriters the excess over the gross
sales commission contained in the following table:








                                          Underwriting

_________________                        ________________
$250 but less than $1,000                    $31.00
$1,000 or more                               $32.00








Any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases listed under "Discounts
for Certain Persons" is the responsibility of the Underwriter making the
sale.


Page 21


In addition to any other benefits that the Underwriters may realize from
the sale of the Units of the Trust, the Agreement Among Underwriters
provides that the Sponsor will share with the other Underwriters, on a
pro rata basis, 50% of the net gain, if any, represented by the
difference between the Sponsor's cost of the Securities in connection
with their acquisition and the Aggregate Offering Price thereof on the
Initial Date of Deposit, less a charge for acquiring the Securities in
the portfolio and for the Sponsor maintaining a secondary market for the
Units. Underwriters are not, however, eligible to receive the additional
dealer concession in connection with sales of $250,000 or more of Units
of this Trust as set forth in "Distribution of Units."

Underwriters:








The Sponsor's Profits



We will receive a gross sales commission equal to the maximum sales
charge per Unit for the Trust less any reduction as stated in "Public
Offering." Also, any difference between our cost to purchase the
Securities and the price at which we sell them to the Trust is
considered a profit or loss (see Note 2 of "Notes to Schedule of
Investments"). During the initial offering period, dealers and others
may also realize profits or sustain losses as a result of fluctuations
in the Public Offering Price they receive when they sell the Units.


In maintaining a market for the Units, any difference between the price
at which we purchase Units and the price at which we sell or redeem them
will be a profit or loss to us.



The Secondary Market



Although not obligated, we may maintain a market for the Units after the
initial offering period and continuously offer to purchase Units at
prices based on the Redemption Price per Unit.


We will pay all expenses to maintain a secondary market, except the
Evaluator fees, Trustee costs to transfer and record the ownership of
Units and costs incurred in annually updating the Trust's registration
statement. We may discontinue purchases of Units at any time. IF YOU
WISH TO DISPOSE OF YOUR UNITS, YOU SHOULD ASK US FOR THE CURRENT MARKET
PRICES BEFORE MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO THE TRUSTEE (OR THE FTPS
UNIT SERVICING AGENT IN THE CASE OF FTPS UNITS).



How We Purchase Units



The Trustee (or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent in the case of FTPS Units)
will notify us of any tender of Units for redemption. If our bid at that
time is equal to or greater than the Redemption Price per Unit, we may
purchase the Units. You will receive your proceeds from the sale no
later than if they were redeemed by the Trustee. We may tender Units we
hold to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. If we elect not
to purchase Units, the Trustee (or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent in the
case of FTPS Units) may sell Units tendered for redemption in the over-
the-counter market, if any. However, the amount you will receive is the
same as you would have received on redemption of the Units.



Expenses and Charges



The estimated annual expenses of the Trust are listed under "Fee Table."
If actual expenses of the Trust exceed the estimate, the Trust will bear
the excess, other than for excess annual audit costs. The Trustee will
pay operating expenses of the Trust from the Interest Account of the
Trust if funds are available, and then from the Principal Account. The
Interest and Principal Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit holders,
so the Trustee may earn interest on these funds, thus benefiting from
their use.


First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of ours, acts as Portfolio
Supervisor and Evaluator and will be compensated for providing portfolio
supervisory services and evaluation services as well as bookkeeping and
other administrative services to the Trust. In providing portfolio
supervisory services, the Portfolio Supervisor may purchase research
services from a number of sources, which may include underwriters or
dealers of the Trust. In addition, the Portfolio Supervisor may, at its


Page 22


own expense, employ one or more sub-Portfolio Supervisors to assist in
providing services to the Trust. The Portfolio Supervisor has employed
BondWave, LLC ("BondWave"), an affiliate of the Sponsor, as sub-
Portfolio Supervisor. BondWave, based in Wheaton, Illinois, specializes
in providing strategies and solutions for the management of fixed-income
investments. As Sponsor, we will receive brokerage fees when the Trust
uses us (or an affiliate of ours) as agent in buying or selling
Securities. Legal and regulatory filing fees and expenses associated
with updating the Trust's registration statement yearly are also
chargeable to the Trust. As authorized by the Indenture, the Trustee may
employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the Trustee to act as broker to
execute certain transactions for the Trust. The Trust will pay for such
services at standard commission rates.


FTP Services LLC, an affiliate of ours, acts as FTPS Unit Servicing
Agent to the Trust with respect to the Trust's FTPS Units. FTPS Units
are Units which are purchased and sold through the Fund/SERV(R) trading
system or on a manual basis through FTP Services LLC. In all other
respects, FTPS Units are identical to other Units. FTP Services LLC will
be compensated for providing shareholder services to the FTPS Units.


The fees payable to First Trust Advisors L.P., FTP Services LLC and the
Trustee are based on the largest aggregate number of Units of the Trust
outstanding at any time during the calendar year, except during the
initial offering period, in which case these fees are calculated based
on the largest number of Units outstanding during the period for which
compensation is paid. These fees may be adjusted for inflation without
Unit holders' approval, but in no case will the annual fees paid to us
or our affiliate for providing services to all unit investment trusts be
more than the actual cost of providing such services in such year.


In addition to the Trust's operating expenses, and the fees set forth
above, the Trust may also incur the following charges:


- All legal and annual auditing expenses of the Trustee according to its
responsibilities under the Indenture;


- The expenses and costs incurred by the Trustee to protect the Trust
and your rights and interests;


- Fees for any extraordinary services the Trustee performed under the
Indenture;


- Payment for any loss, liability or expense the Trustee incurred
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, in
connection with its acceptance or administration of the Trust;


- Payment for any loss, liability or expenses we incurred without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Sponsor of the
Trust; and/or


- All taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Securities or
any part of the Trust.


The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee are secured by a lien on
the Trust. We cannot guarantee that distributions from the Securities
will be sufficient to meet any or all expenses of the Trust. If there is
not enough cash in the Interest or Principal Accounts of the Trust, the
Trustee has the power to sell Securities to make cash available to pay
these charges. These sales may result in capital gains or losses to the
Unit holders. See "Tax Status."


The Trust will be audited annually, so long as we are making a secondary
market for Units. We will bear the cost of these annual audits to the
extent the cost exceeds $0.50 per Unit. Otherwise, the Trust will pay
for the audit. You may request a copy of the audited financial
statements from the Trustee.



Tax Status




Federal Tax Matters.



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of the Trust. This section is current as of
the date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax
consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do
not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person,
a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. In
addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign tax
consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section. In addition,
our counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion
with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be
deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient for you to use for
the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.



Trust Status.



The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company,"
commonly known as a "RIC," under the federal tax laws. If the Trust


Page 23


qualifies as a RIC and distributes its income as required by the tax
law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


For federal income tax purposes, you are treated as the owner of Trust
Units and not of the assets held by the Trust. Taxability issues are
taken into account at the trust level. Your federal income tax treatment
of income from the Trust is based on the distributions paid by the Trust.



Income From the Trust.



Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of each year,
you will receive a tax statement that separates the Trust's
distributions into ordinary dividends, capital gains dividends and
returns of capital. Income reported is generally net of expenses (but
see Deductibility of Trust Expenses, below). Ordinary income
distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate. Generally,
you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your Units. To determine your
actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must
calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.
In addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of
capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.
The tax status of your distributions from the Trust is not affected by
whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Units or receive
them in cash. The income from the Trust that you must take into account
for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a
deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on
December 31 of the previous year.


Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income
from the Trust may also be subject to a new 3.8% "Medicare tax" imposed
for taxable years beginning after 2012. This tax will generally apply to
your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain
threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples
filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.



Dividends Received Deduction.



A corporation that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the
dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the
Trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not
available for distributions from regulated investment companies.



Sale or Redemption of Units.



If you sell or redeem your Units, you will generally recognize a taxable
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must
subtract your tax basis in your Units from the amount you receive in the
transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal to the cost
of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your
Units.


For Units purchased on or after January 1, 2011 (or, 2012, if the Units
are acquired in a reinvestment plan in 2011), the information statement
you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of your Units may
contain information about your basis in the Units and whether any gain
or loss recognized by you should be considered long term or short term
capital gain. The information reported to you is based upon rules that
do not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or
your advisors. You should consult with your tax advisors about any
adjustments that may need to be made to the information reported to you.



Capital Gains and Losses.



If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 0% for certain taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally
effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013. For later
periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% for net
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a
holding period of more than five years, and the 10% rate is reduced to
8% for net capital gains from most property (regardless of when
acquired) with a holding period of more than five years.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if
the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term
if the holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must
exclude the date you purchase your Units to determine your holding
period. However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from the Trust
and sell your Units at a loss after holding it for six months or less,
the loss will be recharacterized as long term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.



Deductibility of Trust Expenses.



Expenses incurred and deducted by the Trust will generally not be
treated as income taxable to you. In some cases, however, you may be
required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as income. In
these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of


Page 24


these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.



Foreign Investors.



If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S.
citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax
treaties, distributions from the Trust will be characterized as
dividends for federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which
the Trust properly reports as capital gain dividends) and will be
subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding taxes, subject to
certain exceptions described below. However, distributions received by a
foreign investor from the Trust that are properly reported by such Trust
as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income
taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust makes
certain elections and certain other conditions are met. In the case of
dividends with respect to taxable years of the Trust beginning prior to
2012, distributions from the Trust that are properly reported by the
Trust as an interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest
income received by the Trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend
attributable to certain net short-term capital gain income received by
the Trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors, provided
that the Trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.


Distributions after December 31, 2012 may be subject to a U.S.
withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-
U.S. financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with
the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and (ii)
certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain
certifications and information about the entity's U.S. owners.


You should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state
or local taxation with respect to your Units.



Rights of Unit Holders




Unit Ownership.



Ownership of Units will not be evidenced by certificates. If you
purchase or hold Units through a broker/dealer or bank, your ownership
of Units will be recorded in book-entry form at the Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") and credited on its records to your broker/dealer's or
bank's DTC account. If you purchase or hold FTPS Units, your ownership
of FTPS Units will be recorded in book-entry form on the register of
Unit holdings maintained by the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent. If you
purchase or hold Units through First Trust's online transaction system
which enables certain financial representatives to process Unit trades
through the First Trust Advisor Direct system ("Advisor Direct"), your
ownership of Units ("Advisor Direct Units") will be recorded in book-
entry form on the register of Unit holdings maintained by the Trustee.
Transfer of Units will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and
its participants if the Units are registered to DTC or its nominee, Cede
& Co., or otherwise will be accomplished by book entries made by the
FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, with respect to FTPS Units, or by the
Trustee, with respect to Advisor Direct Units. DTC will forward all
notices and credit all payments received in respect of the Units held by
the DTC participants. You will receive written confirmation of your
purchases and sales of Units from the broker/dealer or bank through
which you made the transaction or from the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent if
you purchased and hold FTPS Units or from Advisor Direct or the Trustee
with respect to Advisor Direct Units. You may transfer your Units by
contacting the broker/dealer or bank through which you hold your Units,
or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, if you hold FTPS Units, or Advisor
Direct or the Trustee, if you hold Advisor Direct Units.



Unit Holder Reports.



The Trustee will prepare a statement detailing the per Unit amounts (if
any) distributed from the Interest Account and Principal Account in
connection with each distribution. In addition, at the end of each
calendar year, the Trustee will prepare a statement which contains the
following information:


- A summary of transactions in the Trust for the year;


- A list of any Securities sold during the year and the Securities held
at the end of that year by the Trust;


- The Redemption Price per Unit, computed on the 31st day of December of
such year (or the last business day before); and


- Amounts of income and capital distributed during the year.


It is the responsibility of the entity through which you hold your Units
to distribute these statements to you. In addition, you may also request
from the Trustee copies of the evaluations of the Securities as prepared
by the Evaluator to enable you to comply with applicable federal and
state tax reporting requirements.


Interest and Principal
Distributions


You will begin receiving distributions on your Units only after you
become a Record Owner. The Trustee will credit interest received on the
Trust's Securities to the Interest Account of the Trust. All other
receipts, such as return of capital or capital gain dividends, are
credited to the Principal Account of the Trust.


After deducting the amount of accrued interest the Trustee advanced to
us as Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement Date, the Trustee
will distribute an amount substantially equal to your pro rata share of
the balance of the Interest Account calculated on the basis of one-
twelfth of the estimated annual amount of interest received in the
Interest Account after deducting estimated expenses on or near the
Distribution Dates to Unit holders of record on the preceding
Distribution Record Date. See "Summary of Essential Information" for the
Trust. Because interest is not received by the Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, the distributions you receive may be more or less
than the amount credited to the Interest Account as of the Distribution
Record Date. In order to minimize fluctuations in distributions, the


Page 25


Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to
provide distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee will
be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds in the
Interest Account at the next Distribution Record Date. The Trustee will
distribute amounts in the Principal Account on the twenty-fifth day of
each month to Unit holders of record on the tenth day of each month
provided the amount equals at least $1.00 per Unit. However, amounts in
the Principal Account from the sale of Securities designated to meet
redemptions of Units or pay expenses will not be distributed. In any
case, the Trustee will distribute any funds in the Principal Account in
December of each year and as part of the final liquidation distribution.
If the Trustee does not have your TIN, it is required to withhold a
certain percentage of your distribution and deliver such amount to the
IRS. You may recover this amount by giving your TIN to the Trustee, or
when you file a tax return. However, you should check your statements to
make sure the Trustee has your TIN to avoid this "back-up withholding."


Within a reasonable time after the Trust is terminated you will receive
the pro rata share of the money from the disposition of the Securities.


The Trustee may establish reserves (the "Reserve Account") within the
Trust to cover anticipated state and local taxes or any governmental
charges to be paid out of the Trust.



Redeeming Your Units



You may redeem all or a portion of your Units at any time by sending a
request for redemption to your broker/dealer or bank through which you
hold your Units or to the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, if you hold FTPS
Units, or Advisor Direct, if you hold Advisor Direct Units. No
redemption fee will be charged, but you are responsible for any
governmental charges that apply. Certain broker/dealers may charge a
transaction fee for processing redemption requests. Three business days
after the day you tender your Units (the "Date of Tender") you will
receive cash in an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price
per Unit calculated at the Evaluation Time on the Date of Tender.


The Date of Tender is considered to be the date on which your redemption
request is received by the Trustee from the broker/dealer or bank
through which you hold your Units, or, if you hold FTPS Units, the date
the redemption request is received by the FTPS Servicing Agent, or, if
you hold Advisor Direct Units, the date the redemption request is
received either by Advisor Direct or the Trustee, as applicable (if such
day is a day the NYSE is open for trading). However, if the redemption
request is received after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (or after any earlier
closing time on a day on which the NYSE is scheduled in advance to close
at such earlier time), the Date of Tender is the next day the NYSE is
open for trading.


Any amounts paid on redemption representing interest will be withdrawn
from the Interest Account if funds are available for that purpose, or
from the Principal Account. All other amounts paid on redemption will be
taken from the Principal Account. The IRS will require the Trustee to
withhold a portion of your redemption proceeds if the Trustee does not
have your TIN as generally discussed under "Interest and Principal
Distributions."


The Trustee may sell Securities in the Trust to make funds available for
redemption. If Securities are sold, the size and diversification of the
Trust will be reduced. These sales may result in lower prices than if
the Securities were sold at a different time.


Your right to redeem Units (and therefore, your right to receive
payment) may be delayed:


- If the NYSE is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday
closings);


- If the SEC determines that trading on the NYSE is restricted or that
an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the Securities not
reasonably practical; or


- For any other period permitted by SEC order.


The Trustee is not liable to any person for any loss or damage which may
result from such a suspension or postponement.



The Redemption Price.



The Redemption Price per Unit is determined by the Trustee by:


adding


1. cash in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust not
designated to purchase Securities;


2. the aggregate underlying value of the Securities held in the Trust; and


3. accrued interest on the Securities; and


deducting


1. any applicable taxes or governmental charges that need to be paid out
of the Trust;


2. any amounts owed to the Trustee for its advances;


3. estimated accrued expenses of the Trust, if any;


4. cash held for distribution to Unit holders of record of the Trust as
of the business day before the evaluation being made; and


5. other liabilities incurred by the Trust; and


Page 26


dividing


1. the result by the number of outstanding Units of the Trust.


Until the end of the initial offering period, the Redemption Price per
Unit will include estimated organization costs as set forth under "Fee
Table."



Removing Securities from the Trust



The portfolio of the Trust is not managed. However, we may, but are not
required to, direct the Trustee to dispose of a Security in certain
limited circumstances, including situations in which:


-  The issuer of the Security has defaulted in the payment of principal
or interest on the Security;


-  Any action or proceeding seeking to restrain or enjoin the payment of
principal or interest on the Security has been instituted;


-  There is any legal question or impediment affecting the Security;


-  The issuer of the Security has breached a covenant which would affect
the payment of principal or interest on the Security, the issuer's
credit standing, or otherwise damage the sound investment character of
the Security;


-  The issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its
outstanding obligations;


-  The Security is the subject of an advanced refunding;


-  The sale of Securities is necessary or advisable (i) in order to
maintain the qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment
company" or (ii) to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable
year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on
undistributed income in the Trust;


-  Such factors arise which, in our opinion, adversely affect the tax or
exchange control status of the Security;


-  The price of the Security has declined to such an extent, or such
other credit factors exist, that in our opinion keeping the Security
would be harmful to the Trust; or


- The sale of the Security is necessary for the Trust to comply with
such federal and/or state securities laws, regulations and/or regulatory
actions and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time.


If a Security defaults in the payment of principal or interest and no
provision for payment is made, the Trustee must notify us of this fact.
If we fail to instruct the Trustee whether to sell or hold the Security
within 30 days of our being notified, the Trustee may, in its
discretion, sell any defaulted Securities and will not be liable for any
depreciation or loss incurred thereby.


Except for instances in which the Trust acquires Replacement Securities
as described in "The First Trust Combined Series," the Trust will
generally not acquire any bonds or other property other than the
Securities. The Trustee, on behalf of the Trust and at the direction of
the Sponsor, will vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged
bonds or property in exchange for a Security. In that regard, we may
instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer or to take any other action
with respect thereto as we may deem proper if the issuer is in default
with respect to such Securities or in our written opinion the issuer
will likely default in respect to such Securities in the foreseeable
future. Any obligations received in exchange or substitution will be
held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions in the Indenture
to the same extent as Securities originally deposited in the Trust. We
may get advice from the Portfolio Supervisor before reaching a decision
regarding the receipt of new or exchange securities or property. The
Trustee may retain and pay us or an affiliate of ours to act as agent
for the Trust to facilitate selling Securities, exchanged bonds or
property from the Trust. If we or our affiliate act in this capacity, we
will be held subject to the restrictions under the 1940 Act.


The Trustee may sell Securities designated by us, or, absent our
direction, at its own discretion, in order to meet redemption requests
or pay expenses. We will maintain a list with the Trustee of which
Securities should be sold. We may consider sales of units of unit
investment trusts which we sponsor in making recommendations to the
Trustee on the selection of broker/dealers to execute the Trust's
portfolio transactions, or when acting as agent for the Trust in
acquiring or selling Securities on behalf of the Trust.



Amending or Terminating the Indenture



Amendments. The Indenture may be amended by us and the Trustee without
your consent:


- To cure ambiguities;


- To correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision;


- To make any amendment required by any governmental agency; or


- To make other changes determined not to be adverse to your best
interests (as determined by us and the Trustee).


Page 27


Termination. As provided by the Indenture, the Trust will terminate upon
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Security held in
the Trust, but in no case later than the Termination Date as stated in
the "Summary of Essential Information." The Trust may be terminated
prior to the Termination Date:


- Upon the consent of 100% of the Unit holders of the Trust;


- If the value of the Securities owned by the Trust as shown by any
evaluation is less than 20% of the aggregate principal amount of
Securities deposited in the Trust during the initial offering period
("Discretionary Liquidation Amount"); or


- In the event that Units of the Trust not yet sold aggregating more
than 60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by
underwriters, including the Sponsor.


If the Trust is terminated due to this last reason, we will refund your
entire sales charge. For various reasons, the Trust may be reduced below
the Discretionary Liquidation Amount and could therefore be terminated
before the Termination Date.


The Trustee will notify you of any termination prior to the Termination
Date. You will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the
remaining Securities, along with your interest in the Interest and
Principal Accounts of the Trust, within a reasonable time after the
Trust is terminated. The sale of Securities upon termination may result
in a lower sales price than might otherwise be realized if the sale were
not required at that time. For this reason, among others, the amount
realized by a Unit holder upon termination may be less than the
principal amount of Securities per Unit or value at the time of
purchase. The Trustee will deduct from the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided for by the Indenture,
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation
and any amounts required as a reserve to pay any taxes or other
governmental charges.

Description of Bond Ratings*



* As published by Standard & Poor's.



Standard & Poor's.



A Standard & Poor's issue credit rating is a forward-looking opinion
about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a
specific financial program (including ratings on medium-term note
programs and commercial paper programs). It takes into consideration the
creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit
enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in
which the obligation is denominated. The opinion reflects Standard &


Page 29


Poor's view of the obligor's capacity and willingness to meet its
financial commitments as they come due, and may assess terms, such as
collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate
payment in the event of default.


Issue credit ratings can be either long-term or short-term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-
term in the relevant market. In the United States, for example, that
means obligations with an original maturity of no more than 365 days-
including commercial paper. Short-term ratings are also used to indicate
the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long-
term obligations. The result is a dual rating, in which the short-term
rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the usual long-term
rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.



Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings.



Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


1. Likelihood of payment: capacity and willingness of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the
terms of the obligation;


2. Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


3. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The issue rating definitions are an assessment of default risk, but may
incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in
the event of default. Junior obligations are typically rated lower than
senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy, as
noted above. (Such differentiation may apply when an entity has both
senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations,
or operating company and holding company obligations.)


AAA An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by
Standard & Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.


AA  An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest rated obligations
only in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is very strong.


A   An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
obligations in higher rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity
to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more
likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree
of speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely
have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be
outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse
conditions.


BB  An obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which
could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation.


B   An obligation rated "B" is more vulnerable to nonpayment than
obligations rated "BB," but the obligor currently has the capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business,
financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor's
capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.


CCC An obligation rated "CCC" is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions
for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In
the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the
obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation.


CC  An obligation rated "CC" is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.


C   A "C" rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages
allowed by the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that
is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not
experienced a payment default. Among others, the "C" rating may be
assigned to subordinated debt, preferred stock or other obligations on
which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the
instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a
distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is either


Page 30


repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments
having a total value that is less than par.


D   An obligation rated "D" is in payment default. The "D" rating
category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date
due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard
& Poor's believes that such payments will be made during such grade
period. The "D" rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy
petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation
are jeopardized. An obligation's rating is lowered to "D" upon
completion of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the
issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other
instruments having a total value that is less than par.


Plus(+) or Minus(-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within
the major rating categories.


Expected Ratings are designated on the "Schedule of Investments" by an
"(e)" after the rating code. Expected Ratings are intended to anticipate
S&P's forthcoming rating assignments. Expected Ratings are generated by
Bloomberg based on sources it considers reliable or established S&P
rating practices. Expected Ratings exist only until S&P assigns a rating
to the issue.

Risk Factors.



The Trust will invest most of its net assets in securities issued by or
on behalf of (or in certificates of participation in lease-purchase
obligations of) certain states or United States Territories. The Trust
is therefore susceptible to general or particular economic, political or
regulatory factors that may affect issuers of such obligations. The
following information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
many complex factors that may have an effect. The information does not
apply to "conduit" obligations on which the public issuer itself has no
financial responsibility. This information is derived from official
statements of certain national issuers published in connection with
their issuance of securities and from other publicly available
information, and is believed to be accurate. No independent verification
has been made of any of the following information.


The timely payment of principal of and interest on certain of the
Securities may be guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by certain of
the issuers or other parties.


Insurance Risk. Certain of the bonds in the Trust are insured. In the
case of insured bonds, insurance has been obtained either by the issuer
of bonds in the Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor
prior to the deposit of such bonds in the Trust guaranteeing prompt
payment of interest and principal, when due, in respect of such bonds in
the Trust. The premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid
by such issuer, by a prior owner of such bonds or the Sponsor and any
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force
so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective
preinsured bond insurer remains in business. If the provider of an
original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations
under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability
of any such insurer deteriorates, the insurers have no obligation to
insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described
events.

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by an insurer.
In determining eligibility for insurance, insurers have applied their
own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally
use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds
and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of
bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of the insurers are
more restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust
investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This
decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not
eligible for insurance are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all
of the bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts are insured by the
issuer of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor
prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in
respect of a bond, an insurer shall make such payment after the
respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred
or is threatened (but not earlier than the date such payment is due).
The insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will succeed to the
rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All policies issued by the
insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an
Insured Trust are concerned.


Each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in
the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder
at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no
claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the
insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company
to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio
insurance.


There have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings
actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies, Standard &
Poor's Ratings Group, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
("S&P"), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings
Ltd. ("Fitch"). In light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or
announcements by the rating agencies, you should consult announcements
by the rating agencies, the websites of the rating agencies and the
websites of the insurers for the then current publicly available
information. These ratings actions have had a significant impact on the
ability of insurers to compete in the financial guarantee business.



Municipal Securities.



Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity
that are backed by the taxing power of such entity. Other bonds in the
funds may be revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project
or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.
General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its
faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and
interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from the
revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or,
in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other
specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the
security of the different bonds in the funds, both within a particular
classification and between classifications, depending on numerous
factors. A description of certain types of revenue bonds follows.


Healthcare Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be healthcare
revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds issued for healthcare facilities are
sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections of
occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's gross receipts and
net income available for debt service may be affected by future events
and conditions including among other things, demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with
other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of
malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental
financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid
and other similar third party payor programs. Pursuant to recent Federal
legislation, Medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a
prospective basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of rates. Prior
to such legislation Medicare reimbursements were based on the actual
costs incurred by the health facility. The current legislation may
adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for
services provided under the Medicare program.


Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from housing
projects for low to moderate income families. The ability of such
issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and
conditions affecting financed projects, including, among other things,
the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and
adequate rental income, increases in taxes, employment and income
conditions prevailing in local labor markets, utility costs and other


Page 2


operating expenses, the managerial ability of project managers, changes
in laws and governmental regulations, the appropriation of subsidies and
social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the
projects are located. The occupancy of housing projects may be adversely
affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under
Federal and state programs. Multi-family mortgage revenue bonds are
subject to redemption and call features, including extraordinary
mandatory redemption features, upon prepayment, sale or non-origination
of mortgage loans as well as upon the occurrence of other events.
Certain issuers of multi-family housing bonds have considered various
ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first
redemption dates for such bonds. In one situation the New York City
Housing Development Corporation, in reliance on its interpretation of
certain language in the indenture under which one of its bond issues was
created, redeemed all of such issue at par in spite of the fact that
such indenture provided that the first optional redemption was to
include a premium over par and could not occur prior to 1992.


Water and Sewerage Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water
and/or sewerage services. Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable
from user fees. Problems faced by such issuers include the ability to
obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline resulting
in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty
of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of
conservation programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.
All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in
varying degrees.


Utility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of
issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of energy.
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be
charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base.
The problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining
approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing
public utility commission, the difficulty in financing large
construction programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs
and delays attributable to environmental considerations, increased
competition, recent reductions in estimates of future demand for
electricity in certain areas of the country, the difficulty of the
capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining
fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. All of
such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying
degrees. In addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing legislation and impose
additional regulations governing the licensing, construction and
operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect the
ability of the issuers of such bonds to make payments of principal
and/or interest on such bonds.


Lease Obligation Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be lease
obligations issued for the most part by governmental authorities that
have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues.
Rather, the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created
solely for the construction of buildings (schools, administrative
offices, convention centers and prisons, for example) or the purchase of
equipment (police cars and computer systems, for example) that will be
used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). Thus, these
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,
to the annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not
legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments
beyond the current fiscal year. These obligations are also subject to
construction and abatement risk in many states-rental obligations cease
in the event that delays in building, damage, destruction or
condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee. In these
cases, insurance provisions designed to alleviate this risk become
important credit factors. In the event of default by the lessee
government, there may be significant legal and/or practical difficulties
involved in the re-letting or sale of the project. Some of these issues,
particularly those for equipment purchase, contain the so-called
"substitution safeguard," which bars the lessee government, in the event
it defaults on its rental payments, from the purchase or use of similar
equipment for a certain period of time. This safeguard is designed to
insure that the lessee government will appropriate, even though it is
not legally obligated to do so, but its legality remains untested in
most, if not all, states.


Industrial Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be industrial
revenue bonds ("IRBs"), including pollution control revenue bonds, which
are taxable or tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities,
public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,
constructing or improving various industrial projects. These projects
are usually operated by corporate entities. Issuers are obligated only
to pay amounts due on the IRBs to the extent that funds are available


Page 3


from the unexpended proceeds of the IRBs or receipts or revenues of the
issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate
operator of a project. The arrangement may be in the form of a lease,
installment sale agreement, conditional sale agreement or loan
agreement, but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to
be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the IRBs.
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon
the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected
by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality
of the particular company or industry. These include cyclicality of
revenues and earnings, regulatory and environmental restrictions,
litigation resulting from accidents or environmentally-caused illnesses,
extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a
complete restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buy-out, takeover or
otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project
becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness, which in turn would have an adverse impact on the
rating and/or market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of
such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and
consequently the value of such bonds, even though no actual takeover or
other action is ever contemplated or affected. The IRBs in a fund may be
subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may
provide for redemption at par or, with respect to original issue
discount bonds, at issue price plus the amount of original issue
discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if applicable, a premium.
The Sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of
IRBs or other bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of such
bonds.


Transportation Facility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from
the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges,
turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major
portion of an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from
fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which
consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain terminal
space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under
the use agreements. The air transport industry is experiencing
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased
competition, excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic
constraints and other factors, and several airlines are experiencing
severe financial difficulties. The Sponsor cannot predict what effect
these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are
dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and
their usage of the particular airport facility. Similarly, payment on
bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges
and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected
by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of
maintenance, decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative
modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Education Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of
issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools, colleges
and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem
taxes, or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory
revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to school
bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby
creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in
wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on
this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of
school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and
university obligations would include the prospect of a declining
percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals,
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover
increased operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of
Federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or
regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such
issuers. All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these
problems in varying degrees.


Resource Recovery Facility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may
be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived
from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource recovery
facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation
of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic
availability of raw materials, operating supplies or facilities
necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other
unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project;
administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to
the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform; or impose
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot


Page 4


predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery
bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of the Securities.


Discount Securities. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a
market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount of previously
issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously
issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should
also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will
increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if
interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than
bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates
rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium bonds and the
prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced.
Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a
lack of market confidence in the issue. Neither the Sponsor nor the
Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.


Original Issue Discount Securities. Certain of the bonds are considered
original issue discount bonds. Under current law, the original issue
discount, which is the difference between the stated redemption price at
maturity and the issue price of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a
daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest
income for Federal income tax purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain
realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue
discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable
to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is
taxable as ordinary income. The current value of an original issue
discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price
at maturity. The market value tends to increase in greater increments as
the bonds approach maturity.


When Issued Securities. "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that
trade before they are actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can
only deliver them to the Trust when the bonds are actually issued.
Delivery of these Securities may be delayed or may not occur. Interest
on these Securities does not begin accruing to the Trust until the
Sponsor delivers them to the Trust. You may have to adjust your tax
basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these Securities after their
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that
accrued between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of
the Securities to the Trust. This could lower your first year estimated
current return. In addition, you may experience gains or losses on these
Securities from the time you purchase Units even though the Trust has
not received them.


Zero Coupon Securities. Zero coupon bonds (which include bonds known as
multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds, capital appreciation bonds,
capital accumulator bonds, compound interest bonds and money discount
maturity payment bonds) do not provide for the payment of any current
interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value
unless sooner sold or redeemed. Zero coupon bonds may be subject to more
price volatility than conventional bonds. While some types of zero
coupon bonds, such as multipliers and capital appreciation bonds, define
par as the initial offering price rather than the maturity value, they
share the basic zero coupon bond features of (1) not paying interest on
a semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While zero
coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in
large part by weak call protection, i.e., a bond's provision for
redemption at only a modest premium over the accreted value of the bond.


Premium Securities. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a
market premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the fund were
higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued and
otherwise comparable bonds decrease, the market premium of previously
issued bonds will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds increase, the market premium of previously
issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. The current
returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than
the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at
currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to
decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount
becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not
at maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a
reduction in yield. Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally
will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at


Page 5


times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a
premium over the accreted value.


Special Tax Securities. Certain of the bonds may be special tax bonds
payable from and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from
a particular tax. Examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a
hotel room, on the purchase of food and beverages, on the purchase of
fuel, on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor.
Special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the
municipality, and they do not represent general obligations of the
municipality. Payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by
a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax. Also,
should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to
the special tax decline, the municipality may be under no obligation to
increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues
are raised from the shrinking taxable base.


Tax Allocation Securities. Certain of the bonds may be tax allocation
bonds. Tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax
revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment
projects financed by bond proceeds are located. Bond payments are
expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived
from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in
the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates.
Special risk considerations include: variations in taxable values of
property in the project area; successful appeals by property owners of
assessed valuations; substantial delinquencies in the payment of
property taxes; or imposition of any constitutional or legislative
property tax rate decrease.
