History[edit]
KLA-Tencor was formed in 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. KLA Instruments was founded in 1975 by Ken Levy and Bob Anderson, and focused on defect inspection solutions. Karel Urbanek established Tencor Instruments in 1977 with an emphasis on metrology solutions.
Since the merger, which was valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor has acquired 19 additional companies:

1998: Amray Inc.; Nanopro GmbH; The Quantox product line from Keithley Instruments, Inc.; VARS; The Ultrapointe subsidiary of Uniphase Corporation
1999: ACME Systems Inc.
2000: Fab Solutions, from ObjectSpace Inc.; FINLE Technologies, Inc.
2001: Phase Metrics
2004: Candela Instruments; Wafer Inspection Systems business of Inspex, Inc.
2006: ADE Corporation
2007: OnWafer Technologies; SensArray Corporation; Therma-Wave Corporation
2008: ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV; Microelectronic Inspection Equipment (MIE) business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems
2010: Ambios Technology
2014: Luminescent Technologies
2017: Zeta Technologies

In October 2015, Lam Research Corporation announced plans to buy KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[5] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[6] over antitrust concerns.
Process control technology and applications[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and Surface Profilometry and Metrology. KLA-Tencor also provides refurbished tools as part of its K-T Certified™ program [3]
Research and Development[edit]
The market for yield management and process control systems is characterized by rapid technology development and product innovation. KLA-Tencor employs a large staff of full-time engineers and scientists and invests heavily in product research and development.
Facilities[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s global operations include manufacturing, support and R&D facilities throughout Europe, the United States, Japan and Asia/Pacific.

History[edit]
KLA-Tencor was formed in 1997 through the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments, two companies in the semiconductor equipment and yield management systems industry. KLA Instruments was founded in 1975 by Ken Levy and Bob Anderson, and focused on defect inspection solutions. Karel Urbanek established Tencor Instruments in 1977 with an emphasis on metrology solutions.
Since the merger, which was valued at $1.3 billion, KLA-Tencor has acquired 19 additional companies:

1998: Amray Inc.; Nanopro GmbH; The Quantox product line from Keithley Instruments, Inc.; VARS; The Ultrapointe subsidiary of Uniphase Corporation
1999: ACME Systems Inc.
2000: Fab Solutions, from ObjectSpace Inc.; FINLE Technologies, Inc.
2001: Phase Metrics
2004: Candela Instruments; Wafer Inspection Systems business of Inspex, Inc.
2006: ADE Corporation
2007: OnWafer Technologies; SensArray Corporation; Therma-Wave Corporation
2008: ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV; Microelectronic Inspection Equipment (MIE) business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems
2010: Ambios Technology
2014: Luminescent Technologies
2017: Zeta Technologies

In October 2015, Lam Research Corporation announced plans to buy KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[5] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[6] over antitrust concerns.
Process control technology and applications[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s defect inspection and metrology products and related offerings can be broadly categorized into the following groups: Chip Manufacturing, Reticle Manufacturing, Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing, LED Manufacturing, Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microelectromechanical Systems (“MEMS”) Manufacturing, and Surface Profilometry and Metrology. KLA-Tencor also provides refurbished tools as part of its K-T Certified™ program [3]
Research and Development[edit]
The market for yield management and process control systems is characterized by rapid technology development and product innovation. KLA-Tencor employs a large staff of full-time engineers and scientists and invests heavily in product research and development.
Facilities[edit]
KLA-Tencor’s global operations include manufacturing, support and R&D facilities throughout Europe, the United States, Japan and Asia/Pacific.

I was advised that  I should hire Mr. John Redal in my defense and  I have NEVER been sorry! He worked with me regarding his fees and payment plan & let me  use collateral...because of him the court was able to read letters from my doctors and see the situation from my side, when the police department painted me to seem like a reckless out of stater and treated me like a POW, violating some rights that i later decided to just forget after the year long ordeal.  I'm just glad i have my license back and it's all over!  Thank you John!!!! Black Law Pllcnolies2007 ratedShe is the best! Betsy was great and her staff was even better.

Thanks.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures.

There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle.
