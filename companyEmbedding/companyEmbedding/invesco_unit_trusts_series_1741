Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time.

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0034)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Dividend Sustainability Portfolio (DVST0173)
	
	




Objective
		  	
		
		The Portfolio seeks above average capital appreciation. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks derived from the Standard & Poor's 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index consists of stocks of those companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that have increased their actual dividend payments in each of the last 25 years.



A dividend growers domestic option
What makes an aristocrat? A commitment to dividends. The strategy invests in companies that have shown their ability to provide consistent and competitive income potential. 



Totalreturn
 
Incomesustainability
 
Access to industry leaders 


Corporate managers use stable and increasing dividends as a sign of confidence in their firm's prospects, which we believe is important to sustainable income and capital appreciation. 
 
Companies with strong dividend coverage should be able to increase dividend payments.
 
A dividend aristocrat tends to be a large blue-chip company and many of the companies listed on
the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index are familiar household names.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.
S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of S&P 500 constituents that have followed a policy of consistently increasing dividends every year for at least 25 consecutive years. It is not possible to invest directly into an index.
STANDARD & POOR'S, S&P, S&P 500 and DIVIDEND ARISTOCRATS are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P"). Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC ("SPIAS") is a registered investment advisor part of "S&P" Global Market Intelligence.

SPIAS, S&P and their affiliates do not sponsor, endorse, sell, promote or manage any investment fund or other vehicle that is offered by third parties and that seeks to provide an investment return based on a SPIAS investment strategy or the constituents or the returns of any index. SPIAS, S&P and their affiliates make no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any such investment fund or other vehicle.

Individual investors should ultimately rely on their own judgment and/or the judgment of a financial advisor in making their investment decisions. There is no assurance that future dividend payouts will equal or exceed past dividend payouts. Standard & Poor's parent company, The McGraw-Hill  companies, Inc. may be one of the constituents of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index and may be included in the portfolio based solely on quantitative measurements.

About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.

Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.

Dividend Income Leaders Strategy Portfolio (DVLD0173)
	
	




Strategy
The Portfolio seeks to provide current income and the potential for capital appreciation by using an enhanced index strategy* to select a portfolio of 33 dividend paying stocks derived from each sector of the S&P 1500™ Index. The selection process seeks to identify the top dividend yielding stocks across the primary market sectors.




* An enhanced index strategy refers to a unit investment trust strategy sponsored by Invesco Capital Markets Inc. that seeks to outperform an index by investing in an objectively selected subset of stocks from the same index.
 Of course past performance is no guarantee of future results, and the payment of stock dividends is not assured and may vary over time.

Your Portfolio invests in real estate companies, which includes REITs. Real estate companies and REITs may appreciate or depreciate in value, or pay dividends depending upon global and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the strength or weakness of the overall real estate market. Negative developments in the real estate industry will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
The S&P 1500™ Index combines three leading indices, the S&P 500®, the S&P MidCap 400®, and the S&P SmallCap 600® indices to cover approximately 90% of the U.S. market capitalization.
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the indices are shown for illustrative purposes only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or the trust, which will vary.

This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as a part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolios profits and losses.
Your Portfolio invests in real estate companies, which includes REITs. Real estate companies and REITs may appreciate or depreciate in value, or pay dividends depending upon global and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the strength or weakness of the overall real estate market. Negative developments in the real estate industry will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns.

Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee.

 The above graph represents a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the trust strategy (not any actual trust) and the associated benchmark over the period indicated in the graph. The graph assumes the sum of the initial investment ($10,000) and all dividends (including those on stocks trading ex-dividend as of the last day of the year) and appreciation during a year are reinvested at the end of that year. 
All strategy performance is hypothetical (not any actual trust) and reflects trust sales charges (full sales charge in first year of 2.95% and reduced rollover charge thereafter of 1.95%) and expenses but not brokerage commissions on stocks or taxes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Actual returns will vary from hypothetical strategy returns due to timing differences and because the trust may not be invested equally in all stocks or be fully invested at all times. In any given year the strategy may lose money or underperform the index. Returns are calculated by taking year-end prices, subtracting them from the prices at the end of the following year (adjusting for any stock splits that might have occurred during the year) and adding dividends received for the period divided by starting price. Average annual total return and total return measure change in the value of an investment plus dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment of dividends. Average annual total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized. Standard deviation is a measure of volatility that represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular period. Standard deviation does not compare the volatility of an investment relative to other investments or the overall stock market. The more an investment's return varies from the investment's average return, the more volatile the investment. Standard deviation is based on past performance and is no guarantee of future results.
 Please keep in mind that high, double-digit and/or triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent.

The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as a part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolios profits and losses.
Your Portfolio invests in real estate companies, which includes REITs. Real estate companies and REITs may appreciate or depreciate in value, or pay dividends depending upon global and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates and the strength or weakness of the overall real estate market. Negative developments in the real estate industry will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
The S&P 1500™ Index combines three leading indices, the S&P 500®, the S&P MidCap 400®, and the S&P SmallCap 600® indices to cover approximately 90% of the U.S. market capitalization.
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the indices are shown for illustrative purposes only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or the trust, which will vary.
