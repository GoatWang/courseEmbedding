KiloWatt Labs | Better Energy
























  








About Us













 
Better Energy through Distributed Renewable Energy

Kilowatt Labs' energy server, the Centauri, is the world's first energy server that enables 24-hour power from 100% renewable energy sources.  The Centauri is a plug-and-play architecture that accepts multiple energy inputs from both renewable and non-renewable sources. It smartly manages distribution of these energy inputs and delivers stable and reliable electricity, 24 hours a day. The Centauri can be deployed from kilowatts to megawatts and has a designed life of 20 years. 
Centauri Applications: residential, commercial and industrial communities; university campuses; critical services; military bases; mines; agricultural farms; island states; worker camps; prefabricated housing; displaced persons' camps; private virtual networks; telecom towers.




 
Better Energy through Energy Storage

Kilowatt Labs' supercapacitor based storage, the Sirius, delivers the first supercapacitor based energy storage system as an alternative to chemical batteries.
The Sirius energy storage system is modular and can be discharged rapidly or slowly, depending upon the requirements of the load. With an energy density of more than 115Wh/Kg, charging time of less than 30 seconds, cycle life of 1 million cycles, round-trip efficiency of 99%, low cost of manufacturing infrastructure and cheaper pricing, the Sirius energy storage solution is a serious alternative to all chemical batteries and is a new paradigm in energy storage.
Sirius Applications: Utility scale storage for frequency regulation, peak shaving, asset deferral, black start; EV's; Behind-the-Meter storage for residential, commercial and industrial applications; microgrid systems for remote locations; refrigerated containers; man-camp housing; container housing; telecom towers.

Omer Ghani | CEO and Co-founder
Omer is the CEO and Co-founder of Kilowatt Labs and leads the Company in its mission of bringing "practical solutions to big, energy-related problems". Passionate about energy access, climate improvement and a firm belief that solutions to energy problems already exist, Omer tirelessly ensures that the Company's mission is achieved. Omer has developed senior relationships with leading US utilities to collaborate with in rolling out the technologies in the US, and built international reseller partnerships in South Africa, South Asia and the Middle East to grow the global markets. Omer regularly publishes articles on the industry and is a speaker at conferences on storage and distributed renewable technologies.


Omer has, over the past 25 years, successfully launched two other major initiatives that changed the business landscape in which they operated. 
Prior to Kilowatt Labs, Omer was the founding member of CNBC Arabia, the first 24-hour Arabic language business news channel in the Arab World. Omer led the fund raising effort, raising US$ 55 million for the channel and post launch, successfully led the sales, marketing, new media and HR functions, making it the number 1 Arabic business media property in the region. Following the launch of CNBC Arabia, business broadcasting developed as a media segment and several other leading media groups launched their business media properties.

 
Prior to launching CNBC Arabia, Omer was a co-founder of Mannan Shahid Forgings, an automotive parts manufacturing firm in Pakistan. He was instrumental in developing the firm's export markets to US and European automotive OEM's. Never before had automotive parts been exported by a Pakistani manufacturer to US / European OEM manufacturers. Mannan Shahid set up the roadway that then enabled other automotive manufacturers from Pakistan to start exporting to leading OEM's in USA and Europe.
Prior to Mannan Shahid, Omer spent several years as Engagement Manager with KPMG Consulting in Pakistan with a focus on the media and financial services verticals, delivering strategic solutions to some of the largest institutions in Pakistan.
Omer started his career in the merchant banking division of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, managing discretionary client portfolios, investing in convertible bonds, warrants, Japanese equities and government bonds, and US Treasury bonds. 
Omer has two children, lives in New York, and is a graduate of Columbia University with a degree in Industrial Engineering.









 

  






Waseem Ashraf Qureshi | Inventor, CTO and Co-founder
Waseem is the inventor of all of Kilowatt Labs' technologies. 
Waseem is the youngest ever recipient of the National Science Award in Pakistan, awarded at the age of 15. He has subsequently received several other such national accolades.  
Waseem leads the Company's invention and technology improvement programs, which are developing disruptive technologies for other industries and continually improving the technologies already invented. His brilliance lies in using existing parts and materials (usually 'off-the-shelf') and bringing efficiencies through innovative and creative software design. Operating in a resource constrained environment while growing up, Waseem has always believed that there is a better and cheaper way of doing things.
Waseem has invented and designed prolifically in various capacities starting with the invention of the first uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system in Pakistan in 1984 at the age of 14, which he successfully commercialized the following year at the age of 15.
He also invented, designed, and launched the first car tracking system in Pakistan, as well as several telecom applications. He is a prolific researcher, designer and developer of new technologies and now is focused on energy products, including development of wireless charging technology, the first fast charging battery and the first low -energy, compressor -free air-conditioning system. He has also designed a solar system to withstand extreme temperatures for the Pakistan army.
He is married with 3 children, lives in Dubai and is a graduate in electronics from the University of Engineering & Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.
