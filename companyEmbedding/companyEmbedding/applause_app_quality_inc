In the early stages, we concentrated our manual QA on the new stuff in the next release. Timeline pressures impacted regression coverage, so we had to make decisions about what areas to test. Working with Applause, we stopped making those tradeoff decisions. We cover everything with Applause.”

Security Assessments
Protect your customers’ data and privacy

Blueport Commerce Leverages Applause to Deliver Unmatched Omnichannel Digital Experiences for Furniture Retailers
May 11 17
Applause announced that it is working with Blueport Commerce to ensure the quality of the platform is world-class across all devices and geographies. Blueport is faced with an incredible challenge to provide a seamless cloud-based shopping experience for all of its customers and Applause ensures that it does. With an agile development process that involves updates every two weeks, Blueport has significant testing requirements to ensure that their customers can deliver a seamless digital experience to consumers. Applause's community of testing experts is integrated into that development and release cycle to ensure that any bugs or experience flaws are identified and remedied before new experiences and services go live.


Accenture Forms Alliance with Applause to Help Organizations Adopt Crowdtesting as Part of Liquid Workforce Strategy
Sep 14 16
Accenture has formed an alliance with Applause. With an initial focus on digital application testing, the new alliance provides organizations with access to crowdsourcing services as part of their broader testing program, in order to accelerate software releases and ensure more seamless customer experiences. The testing market is exploding as the number of devices, operating systems and applications keeps growing. In addition, countries have varied security requirements, privacy laws, and other regulations, making testing requirements more complex—creating an ideal scenario to tap into the testing capabilities provided by Applause’s global, diverse crowd of testers. In one recent project, Accenture turned to Applause to help test mobile applications on devices across more than 30 countries, with over 50% of the countries staffed on an as-needed basis. This staffing flexibility helped the client achieve significant cost savings, in addition to dramatically improved application quality and speed to market. With effective project and work flow management and scheduling, the overall testing efforts were reduced by over 30%.

Testing in-house for a small company is challenging and Applause comes to solve this problem.They offer 'in the wild' testing, so your app is being tested on a variety of devices (and locations if needed) which makes the testing process as close as possible to real world usage.Applause provides a good coverage of OSs and devices for testing, so it saves you from having to buy many devices for testing your app.some of the main benefits are:- You control the tests and can connect with Applause testers at any time.- You are kept up to date regarding the status of the tests.- It has a very intuitive user interface.- If you need multilingual test, they provide testers in many locations that can test in their native language.- Applause integrates with most of the popular bug tracking systems.- The testers...What do you dislike?Having testers who are not familiar with your app can add time to the testing process and may add test cycles.Testers' skill leve can vary and so is their ability to dig deeper in the app to find more low level issues, so it takes a more detailed testing plan and test cases prepared by the developer.Can take some time until you learn to use the service effectively and actually save on testing time.The Applause service is expensive (but you do save on buying devices for testing).Recommendations to others considering the productPlan your testing in details before trying to implement Applause in your QA.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Small and medium companies can improve their product and reduce the total testing time after finding the right way for them to utilize this testing platfotm.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ApplauseReport a ConcernBrett R.Review SourceBrett R.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceExcellent ResourceUpdated On August 14, 2015Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?Applause gives you real-world results with testing on real devices that aren't as pristine as normal QA lab devices. A huge advantage is that you getting feedback from people who would normally be your customers on their devices, including some whacky stuff that would only happen under real world conditions. Better to know now, than after release!What do you dislike?The only drawback is sometimes, depending on what testers accept your test cycle, feedback can be inconsistent on quality (although you can run many test cycles and have different users for each one). Recommendations to others considering the productIf you are skeptical and can work it out, at least do a trial application or two - you will see the benefit!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Being a relatively small developer but with a huge customer base, Applause allowed us to increase the quality of our app by expanding the number of users and the numbers of devices that were used for QA purposes. We had a ton of users, but with only a few dedicated QA people, we needed to branch out and make sure what we were seeing in the lab (or not seeing in the lab) was what the customers were seeing worldwide.

While we are only just starting our journey with the product it has proved it's worth finding some vital bugs which would have impacted our App's on launch.  It is great for quick review cycles at short notice, to supplement our QA teams with additional breadth and coverage.  You can go home of a evening and come back the next day to a QA cycle having been run. We haven't yet used the other products from Applause including their tracking software although we plan to use this in the coming months.What do you dislike?Getting consistency and a repeat user base.  That is our next step to build a regular team, almost like having our own QA department.  There is nothing really to dislike as it is what you make of the service.Recommendations to others considering the productTrial the service, do a test and learn and then develop the strategy and how you will use the product.  You need some specific goals you are trying to address such as device coverage.  What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We are trying to solve having limited time for QA but with the coming together of our products in to a omni-channel experience we have to test more but within the same timescales.  Using Applause gives us flexibility to test a greater range of devices, cover more systems and provide in the wild experiences of our App's and website.  Just doing the things that customers do but before we go live.  The exploratory nature and motivation of the testers, plus the support of the Applause QA leads is now becoming a cornerstone of our Testing Strategy.

Applause solves this testing problem with their 'In-The-Wild' service; by having a large managed resource of global testers that can effectively simulate real-world testing. It's as close to the real-world happy path as you can get.What do you dislike?Though Applause effectively manages their testers, there can be a gap at times between lining up the testers and getting the results you want. It's a fine balance between fresh eyes gleaning new or glossed over bugs but running the risk of being product ignorant vs. returning testers generating more in-depth issues and risking test exhaustion and jaded perspectives. Direction is key to getting the testers to generate the results you want, most importantly maintaining a close relationship with your Applause Project Manager to ensure the test-team is managed appropriately.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Mobile apps today require fast and frequent updates. Running exhaustive test suites is time consuming and limited to the prescribed tests defined plus the platforms/devices/os on-hand. Opening up and augmenting this classic regression test approach with Applause's 'In-The-Wild' service significantly reduces the risk of the product failing on launch.

Also, since testers are from around the world and typically do this on a part time basis, it was easy to get overnight and weekend cycles running.   The bug management tool was also easy to use and you could leave messages for testers if you had questions about the bugs they opened.  What do you dislike?I feel there are some drawbacks to the pay-per-bug compensation structure for testers.  Although there were certainly critical bugs that were uncovered, a lot of the bugs seemed extraneous and it was tedious sifting through them all.  I feel like I spent a lot of time going through bugs to determine which ones were out of scope or reproducible, even though the test lead had done some of the work for me.  Also, when we had subsequent test cycles to re-test a build with fixes in it, tester engagement dropped off pretty quickly.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We needed to be able to ramp up QA resources on demand and ramp them down when we finished projects.  Applause offers a great alternative to staffing in-house, especially when you need to cover a lot of different aspects with your testing.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ApplauseReport a ConcernIan G.Review SourceIan G.Validated ReviewReview SourceApplause gives me peace of mindUpdated On August 14, 2015Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?I really like how flexible Applause has been. They truly have worked with our company to customize the way they serve us.  I truly believe that they want our company to succeed and our experience to be as positive as possible.   This kind of customer loyalty has really helped me to feel like they are a part of my QA team.  What do you dislike?Currently I don't have any issues or items I dislike.  At one point I asked them to make me team to test during the night and they did that.   Later I realized that it wasn't working well.  That I wanted to communicate with the Applause team.  So Applause got me a new team that works with me during the day.   I'm very happy with their willingness to adapt.Recommendations to others considering the productI recommend a mix of exploratory testing and hourly testing buckets.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We have 25 developers and 2 onsite QA engineers.   Without the support of Applause we would not be able to succeed in QA.    They solve our issues on a weekly basis by helping us test every tuesday.  That frees up the developers to develop instead of helping us test.  It also allows us to hone in on the larger issues found rather then to get caught up in the small details.   Also, when big changes are sprung upon us the exploratory testing cycles are so valuable.

Applause App Quality, Inc. is a venture-funded company that tests software and conducts usability feedback research.
The company's headquarters are located in Framingham, Massachusetts. It has additional U.S. locations in San Mateo, California and Seattle, Washington.[2] Its European headquarters are located[3] in Berlin, and it has additional offices in Poland[4] and Israel.
History and Acquisitions[edit]
The company was originally incorporated under the name uTest in August 2007 by founders Doron Reuveni and Roy Solomon[5] with $2.3M in seed funding from Mesco Ltd. and the Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation (MTDC).[6]

August 2012: The company acquired an SDK, Apphance, and staff from Polish company Polidea[7][8]
January 2014: The company closed a $43 million Series E round of funding, led by Goldman Sachs, bringing its current funding to more than $80 million.[9]
May 2014: The company changed its name to Applause[10] concurrent with the acquisition of German testing company Testhub, which became Applause's European headquarters.[11]
September 2016: The company closed a $35 million Series F round of funding,[12] led by Credit Suisse with investment also from strategic partner Accenture, bringing its current funding to more than $115 million.

Applause subsequently repurposed the uTest brand as a community of professional testers. Growing to more than 250,000 testers,[13] uTest relaunched as a brand of Applause App. Quality, Inc. in 2015 with an updated site as a social network for software testers.[14]
Product[edit]
Applause provides testing services, usability feedback and research. Notable customers include Google, Fox Broadcasting, eBay, Concur and Runkeeper.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
