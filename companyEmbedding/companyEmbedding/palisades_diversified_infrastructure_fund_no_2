Palisade's Australian Social Infrastructure Fund

The Palisade Australian Social Infrastructure Fund (PASIF) invests in Australian social infrastructure assets delivered under a PPP model. Government ‘availability payments’ account for the majority of project revenues, where government accepts or manages demand or utilisation levels for the facilities.
Social infrastructure assets typically offer long term, low volatility and inflation-linked income streams with little or no correlation to economic cycles. These characteristics mirror the objectives of the fund, which are to offer long term, low volatility, inflation linked distributions to investors.
Palisade has entered into a strategic alliance with the Plenary Group which gives PASIF access to all future projects of Plenary Group, Australia’s leading originator of social infrastructure projects. Additionally, a tripartite alliance with Quebec’s La Caisse provides a strong co-investment partner for Palisade and an established governance regime for all assets in which the parties co-invest.
The Fund was established in early 2011 and holds an interest in the following assets:

Gold Coast Rapid Transit
Casey Hospital
South Australian Police and Courts
LEAP 1
LEAP 2
Biosciences Research Centre
Sydney Metro Northwest

New fund to offer unlisted infrastructure





21-May-2014

The Infrastructure Partners Investment Fund (IPIF) will unlock unlisted infrastructure as an asset class for investors, including self-managed super funds (SMSF).

The fund will open investments in existing unlisted infrastructure funds and include smaller institutional investors, high net worth investors and SMSFs, which have been largely excluded from access to the unlisted infrastructure market.

It aimed to raise $200 million and open a substantial pool of capital to support the growing need for infrastructure investment in Australia.

Pacific Hydro director and former Utilities Trust of Australia chairman Geoff Coffey will chair the fund.

“We have improved the availability of this attractive, stable class by aggregating selected funds with attractive, proven assets and offering access at low fees, with appropriate liquidity,” Coffey said.

Australian unlisted infrastructure has provided strong historical performance on an absolute basis with a 10-year average return of 13.5 per cent a year and a consistent cash yield of about 5 per cent a year. The yield was relatively stable during the global financial crisis.

“Unlike property, infrastructure cash yields are less influenced by the economic cycle. 
Infrastructure delivers stable cash flows and its low correlation to the movements in equity markets and relatively lower risk profile make it a highly appealing proposition,” Coffey said.

He said the IPIF would offer access to a portfolio of primarily unlisted managers, such as Hasting Utilities Trust of Australia and the Palisade Diversified Investment Fund.

“We will also have an allocation to listed infrastructure through RARE Value Fund to provide further diversification. Assets include mature, cash-generating regulated utilities, mature road tolls and growth assets such as airports and seaports,” he said.

Palisade storming social infrastructure


By I & T News 
| 21/08/2012



By I & T News21/08/2012 Palisade Investment Partners is seeing increasing interest from large funds in social infrastructure, with director Roger Lloyd saying that the assets’ steady yielding, lower risk characteristics are attractive diversifiers.This bullish outlook for mid-market infrastructure-asset demand comes as Palisade announces it had reached financial closure with the Plenary Group on an equity acquisition in the second stage of its Living Environment Accommodation Project (LEAP) through Palisade’s Australian Social Infrastructure Fund (PASIF).The acquisition represents a 49.9-per-cent investment in the project and follows PASIF’s 49.9-per-cent investment in the first stage of LEAP in June 2011.LEAP 1 was a $23.1-million fund, with its second incarnation topping $38 million. Despite the small size of the funds, Lloyd says that larger investors are looking more closely at social infrastructure linked to long-term government contracts.“We have had a bit of contact with some of Australia’s larger funds and there is a feeling of ‘why haven’t we been doing this before?’ – it is like a watershed, and the light has gone on,” he says.The latest social infrastructure fund is invested in 3000 accommodation units being built on 14 defence bases across Australia.

Capital costs are in excess of $800 million and the investors have a 30-year concession from the Australian Government.The majority of debt finance is provided by Australian banks and superannuation funds.Lloyd says that a long-term CPI-linked revenue stream is attractive to investors, with a typical yield as much as 600 to 700 basis points above Australian Government bonds. The great LEAP forward
Palisade has set itself ambitious expansion plans and is adding new staff with the goal of reaching between $1.75 and $2 billion in assets over the next few years.“I see no reason why over the next two to three years we wouldn’t have $500 million in social infrastructure assets, and at the same time they will be a balanced portfolio of green and brownfield assets,” he says.LEAP 1 included investments includes the 229-bed Casey Hospital in Melbourne and the operation of nine police and courthouse complexes in six locations across regional South Australia.Lloyd predicts that the size of social infrastructure assets will grow in the coming years, as it becomes a more mainstream part of the infrastructure holdings of institutional investors.“Assets will get bigger, and more equity will be required and will get out of bed for it,” he says.“I think there will be a huge demand for social infrastructure like this that is at the lower end of the risk spectrum for infrastructure.” Attractive opportunities
Opportunities in the space are already being realised by overseas investors. Palisade co-invested in both LEAP projects with Canada’s Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (Caisse), the country’s second largest pension fund, and Plenary Group. The three players struck an agreement and governance structure that lays the foundation for a long-term investment partnership.Plenary Group recently announced that it has reached an agreement with Caisse to invest in five public-private partnerships in Australia, including the Melbourne Convention Centre.The Canadian fund’s investments total $139.2 million across the five projects, according to the Plenary Group.Lloyd says that foreign investors such as Caisse are seeing a number of attractive opportunities.“There is more offshore money buying Australian infrastructure assets than there is Australian money,” he notes.The strategic agreement with Palisade, Caisse and Plenary Group provides Palisade with first right of refusal for equity in Plenary originated projects. Since Palisade acquired the management rights to two infrastructure funds from Perpetual in 2008, the business has enjoyed exponential growth, with assets under management growing from $200 million to more than $700 million.Assets are split between three funds covering core, social and regional infrastructure.Its diversified infrastructure fund has core assets including airports in the Northern Territory, a power station in Western Australia and a wind farm in South Australia.The regional infrastructure fund focuses on food, water, waste and energy assets, and includes regional livestock yards and a waste-treatment plant.

Media Release: Palisade Investment Partners awarded long term lease of Sunshine Coast Airport

09/02/2017









Palisade Investment Partners Limited (Palisade) has entered into a binding agreement for a 99-year lease of Sunshine Coast Airport (SCA) from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council (Council) for $82m.
SCA was the fastest growing airport in Australia for the FY 2016 by scheduled passenger volumes, and sits at the centre of one of Australia’s most dynamic regions. The Sunshine Coast is forecast to achieve population growth significantly above the national average, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, along with robust economic growth.
“We are very excited about this investment, which expands our decade-long involvement in the regional airport sector through investments in the Darwin, Alice Springs and Tennant Creek airports,” said Palisade Managing Director & CEO Roger Lloyd. “We intend forging a long-term partnership with Sunshine Coast Regional Council to enhance the value of this strategic Australian infrastructure asset.”
Palisade has also made arrangements with Council for the construction of a new 2.45km runway, apron expansion and related infrastructure, in return for a fixed payment from Palisade of $290m following project completion. The runway project will reduce operational constraints at the airport, facilitate new route opportunities, increased passenger growth and economic development of the region by providing capacity to accommodate larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft and enabling more direct flights.

“I am also delighted to announce that Dennis Chant has been appointed to assist in the transition of SCA into private ownership and ongoing governance of the business,” said Mr Lloyd. “Dennis is the former CEO of Queensland Airports Limited, and is one of Australia’s most experienced regional airport managers through his role in growing Gold Coast, Townsville and other regional airports.”
The SCA transaction will be funded through equity commitments from Palisade’s Diversified Infrastructure Fund (PDIF), together with investments from two of Palisade’s institutional clients, LGIAsuper and VicSuper. PDIF has generated total gross returns of 14.3% pa over the five years to 31 December 2016.
Palisade will be actively seeking opportunities to deploy further capital into the Airport precinct and the broader Sunshine Coast region.
Gresham Partners and Gilbert & Tobin acted for Palisade as financial and legal advisers respectively.

FUM and commitments managed by Palisade have grown from $700m in 2012 to $2.3bn at 31 December 2016.
The SCA transaction continues Palisade’s 10+ year involvement in the regional airport sector, through its successful investment in the Darwin, Alice Springs and Tennant Creek airports.
It follows Palisade’s investment activity over the past year, which has included:

acquiring an interest in the Gold Coast University Hospital and Private Hospital Car Parks project;
investing in the Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 2 expansion project and acquiring a further 2.1% equity stake in Stage 1;
acquiring a 50% interest in the 142MW Ross River Solar Farm development project underpinned by a long-term power purchase agreement.
