	HH BIOTECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES









	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)










	1.             Description of business



	 




	HH Biotechnology Holdings Company (“HHBT” or the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 4, 1987, under the name of Quantus Capital, Inc. The Company, through its various subsidiaries, is engaged in commercial and residential real estate leasing, management, consulting, investment, development and sales in the city of Shenyang, Liaoning Province, in the People’ Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company is also engaged in the wholesale and retail distribution of consumer products including food products, dietary supplements, household products and daily necessities, etc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Shenyang Ai Zhuang Trading Co., Ltd (“Ai Zhuang”), and the 53% owned entity, Panacea Co., Ltd.








	2.             Summary of significant accounting policies




	 




	Principles of consolidation








	The

	accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Silverstrand International Holdings Company Limited, Shenyang Maryland International Industry Company Limited, Shenyang Ai Zhuang Trading Co., Ltd (“Ai Zhuang”), and the 53% owned entity, Panacea Co., Ltd. Ai Zhuang and Panacea Co

	., Ltd. All significant inter-company transactions and balances within the Company are eliminated in consolidation.








	Use of estimates







	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.







	Fair Value Measurements




	 





	The Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements.  ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.






	   






	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.






	 






	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:






	 









	●






	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.












	●






	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.












	●






	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.








	 




	There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

	Foreign currency translation







	The Company uses the United States dollar for financial reporting purposes. The Company’s subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency - Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY), being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted. All assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate, stockholder’s equity are translated at the historical rates and income statement and statement of cash flows items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows may not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive as a component of shareholders’ equity.







	Cash and cash equivalents







	The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, including accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.







	Allowance for doubtful accounts







	The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and other receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company reserved $2,066,239 and $1,644,340 respectively, for other receivable bad debt; and $653,023 and $675,929 respectively, for accounts receivable bad debt. The Company also reserved $0 and $2,415,944 respectively for loans receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.










	Property, plant and equipment







	Property, plant and equipment is being depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over useful lives as follows:
















	Buildings






	8-26 years








	Equipment






	5 years








	Automobile






	5 years








	Office furniture and fixtures






	5 years












	Repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations and other comprehensive income in the year in which they are incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset, the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset.







	Property, plant and equipment are evaluated annually for any impairment in value. Where the recoverable amount of any property, plant and equipment is determined to have declined below its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to reflect the decline in value. There were no property, plant and equipment impairments recognized as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.







	Rental property







	Properties include buildings held for rental and land use rights, which are being depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over 20-26 years. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net property held for rental amounted to $31,913,126 and $35,502,002 respectively. Accumulated depreciation of rental properties amounted to $36,301,614 as of September 30, 2016 and $35,044,528 as of December 31, 2015.

	Investment-related party





	 




	Because the fair value is not readily determinable and less than 20% of voting rights, our long-term investments apply ASC 325-20 cost method investments.

	The Company carries at cost with its investment in investees which does not have readily determinable fair value and the Company does not have significant influence. The Company only adjusts for other-than-temporary declines in fair value and distributions of earnings that exceed the Company’s share of earnings since its investment. The Company regularly evaluates the impairment of the cost method investments based on performance and financial position of the investee as well as other evidence of market value. Such evaluation includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the investee’s cash position, recent financing, projected and historical financial performance, cash flow forecasts and financing needs. An impairment loss is recognized in earnings equal to the excess of the investment’s cost over its fair value at the balance sheet date of the reporting period for which the assessment is made. The fair value would then become the new cost basis of investment.

	Revenue recognition








	Rental income and management fee income – The Company recognizes the rental income on the straight-line basis over the terms of the tenancy agreements. The management fee, including the service fee mainly for property management, maintenance and repair, and security, is recognized quarterly over the terms of the tenancy agreements.







	Real estate sales – Revenue from the sales of development properties is recognized by the full accrual method when the sale is consummated. A sale is not considered consummated until (1) the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, (2) all consideration has been exchanged, (3) any permanent financing of which the seller is responsible has been arranged, (4) all conditions precedent to closing have been performed, (5) the seller does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property, and (6) the usual risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Sales transactions not meeting all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method, all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability.







	Real estate capitalization and cost allocation – Real estate held for development or sale is stated at cost or estimated net realizable value, whichever is lower. Costs include land and land improvements, direct construction costs and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest on indebtedness, real estate taxes, insurance, construction overhead and indirect project costs. Selling and advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total estimated costs of multi-unit developments are allocated to individual units based upon specific identification methods.




	 




	Impairment – If real estate is determined to be impaired, it will be written down to its fair market value. Real estate held for development or sale costs include the cost of land use rights, land development and home construction costs, engineering costs, insurance costs, wages, real estate taxes, and interest related to development and construction. All costs are accumulated by specific projects and allocated to residential and commercial units within the respective projects. The Company leases the land for the residential unit sites under land use rights with various terms from the government of the PRC. The Company evaluates the carrying value for impairment based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets. Write-downs of inventory deemed impaired would be recorded as adjustments to the cost basis. No depreciation is provided for construction in progress.




	 







	Other income







	Other income consists of land leveling income, parking lot income, cleaning income and etc. This income was recognized as the services were performed and the settled amount has been paid in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

	Earnings (loss) per share







	Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.







	As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, there were no outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as options, warrants or conversion rights, which would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share as the effect of options outstanding at that time was anti- dilutive.







	Income taxes







	The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.




	 




	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the difference are expected to affect taxable income.




	 




	The Company records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, if any, based on its estimates of its future taxable income as well as its tax planning strategies when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.








	Non-controlling interest



	 



	 Non-controlling interest represents the portion of equity that is not attributable to the Company. The net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are separately presented in the accompanying statements of income and other comprehensive income. Losses attributable to non-controlling interests in a subsidiary may exceed the interest in the subsidiary’s equity. The related non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit of the non-controlling interest balance. The non-controlling interest rate of entity Panacea Co., Ltd., which was set up in April 2015, was 47%, with the amount of $21,099 and $142,782 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.








	Concentrations of business and credit risk







	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables arising from its normal business activities. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in what it believes to be credit-worthy financial institutions. The Company has a diversified customer base, most of which are in China.







	The Company controls credit risk related to accounts receivable through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk, establishes an allowance, if required, for uncollectible accounts and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is limited.







	Statement of cash flows







	Cash flows from the Company's operations is calculated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows may not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.

	Revenue Recognition


	:    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,


	 


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606


	 


	and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively (ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 collectively, Topic 606). Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others. Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within Topic 606 or (2) retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606. Preliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method (1) and we do not believe there will be a material impact to our revenues upon adoption. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net),” clarifying the principal versus agent guidance in the new revenue recognition standard, by revising the indicators to focus on evidence that the company is a principal. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” reducing the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and clarifying how to determine whether revenue related to a performance obligation for an intellectual property license is recognized over time or at a point in time. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” clarifying certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition. These ASUs are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, allow for early adoption in the first quarter of 2017 and may be applied using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact these ASUs will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.










	Disclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties

	:     In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), to provide guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company’s financial statements will be material.









	Liabilities

	: In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The new consolidation standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed, including early adoption in an interim period. A reporting entity may apply a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or may apply the amendments retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.








	Financial instrument


	: In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

	In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and allows for early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

	Leases

	: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-2”), which provides guidance on lease amendments to the FASB Accounting should Standard Codification. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in May 1, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-2on our consolidated financial statements.









	Stock-based Compensation


	:    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,


	 


	Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting


	 


	(ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, and earlier adoption is permitted.


	We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.










	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

	: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss, which will be more decision useful to users of the financial statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is allowed as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.




	 





	Statement of Cash Flows

	: In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice described above. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	11.           Segment information







	ASC 280 requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.



	 




	During 2016 and 2015, the Company was organized into two main business segments: (1) Rental income & Management fee, and (2) Consumer product sales. The following table presents a summary of operating information and certain year-end balance sheet information as of nine-month and three-month periods ended of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Our financing activities used $4,631,202 in cash during the period ended September 30, 2016 since we paid off the remaining bank loan. There was no more outstanding bank loan as of September 30, 2016.



	 



	During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,320,719. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $25,497. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,069,297 during the period. The resulting change in cash for the period was an increase of $1,109,821.

	As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $13,151,931 in total current liabilities, which comprised of $4,248,095 in accounts payable, $13,460 in accrued expenses, $1,909,006 in other payable, $1,298,015 in advance from tenants, $364,377 in due to a related party, $780,646 in payable to disposed subsidiaries, and $4,538,332 in tax payables.

	The Company had no outstanding bank loans as of September 30, 2016.

We are also exploring various proposals and alternatives in order to secure sources of financing and improve our financial position. We are also exploring potential strategic partnerships, which could provide a capital infusion to the Company. Additionally, the Company is assessing its ability to increase rental rates for its leasing business in order to generate additional revenue.  Further, the Company is continuing to focus efforts on cost containment to reduce general and administrative expenses.  With its relevant hands-on expertise, the Company also plans to expand operations to include property management.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







	Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive and Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act’) as of the end of the period covered by this interim period report.  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our certifying officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our certifying officer concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC due to a weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures.




	 





	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and, providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.




	 



	Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016.







	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had only one executive officer performing the functions of chief executive officer and chief financial officer.  As a result, the Company’s internal controls were deficient for the following reasons:



	 


	18





	 






	 










	 





	 







	●






	There were no entity level controls because there was only one person serving in the dual capacity of chief executive officer and chief financial officer,















	●






	There was no segregation of duties as that same person was responsible for the process of approving and paying the Company’s bills and recording the other financial transactions of the Company, and















	●






	There was no separate audit committee.











	As a result of management’s evaluation described above, it concluded on that the Company had significant control deficiencies as of September 30, 2016, that constituted a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Notwithstanding these control deficiencies, our certifying officer believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods presented.







	The Company proposes to remediate the material weakness as its business develops by engaging accounting support that will effectively segregate different accounting functions and incorporate control processes for managing the accounting and financial affairs of the Company.  As the Company’s business develops it will recruit additional directors who are independent and can otherwise serve on an audit committee that fulfills the traditional oversight functions with respect to our internal system of controls and financial reporting.







	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the USA. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this discussion to "we", "our" and "us" are to HH Biotechnology Holdings Company, and its subsidiaries.  Any statements in this discussion that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties; actual results may differ from the forward-looking statements. Sentences or phrases that use such words as "believes", "anticipates", "plans", "may", "hopes", "can", "will", "expects", "is designed to", "with the intent", "potential" and others indicate forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Executive Summary  HHBT, through its various subsidiaries, is or has been engaged in commercial and residential real estate leasing, management, consulting, investment, development and sales, We conduct all our operation in the People's Republic of China through our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries; Silverstrand International Holdings Company Limited ("Silverstrand")., Shenyang Maryland International Industry Company Limited ("Maryland"),Shenyang Ai Zhuang Trading Co., Ltd ("Ai Zhuang"), and Panacea Co., Ltd. Ai Zhuang and Panacea Co., Ltd. were established during the first Nine months of 2015 to engage in wholesale and retail distribution of consumer products including food products, dietary supplements, household products and publications. Ai Zhuang and Panacea Co., Ltd. had started business operation during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Recent Development  There is a huge demand for health care products. According to the Boston consulting firm (BCG) latest report "released from insight to action: Digging China health consumer market" pointed out: the Chinese consumers are leading the global health awareness, which is due to the care about the health and effects of China development environment. By 2020 China's GDP will reach about 8 trillion and 500 billion yuan in the narrow sense, while the general health industry production value will reach 17 trillion yuan.  In 2015, HHBT began the transformation of the main business, because of macadamia nuts in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease has a prominent effect. HHBT will regard the perilla oil as the core raw material, through bio technology, research and development of green health food products (drugs) the company's main business, plans to transition from planting, development to production and marketing of the whole industry chain green health industry company.  On May 15, 2016, HH Biotechnology Holdings Company ("HHBT" or the "Company") entered into a Framework Agreement on Capital Increase and Equity Enlargement (the "Agreement") with the shareholders of Jiangcheng Sino-Au Agricultural Technology Development Co., Ltd. ("SAAT") for the purchase of 14.07 million shares in the capital of SAAT for RMB 37.4795 million Yuan (approximately US$5,746,318 at May 16, 2016). After the investment HHBT holds 11.12% of the total share capital of SAAT.  SAAT owns approximately 2,470 acres of land in Yunnan Province, PRC, and is engaged in the business of cultivating, processing, and trading Macadamia. The acquisition of the interest in SAAT is a major step forward in the plan of HHBT to move into the nutraceutical and healthy foods sector.  On July 27, 2016, the board of directors and stockholders of HHBT approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing the name of the Company to "HH Biotechnology Holdings Company." We expect to file a certificate of amendment with the state of Nevada to effectuate the name change within a few days after the later of the date that is 20 days from the date this Information Statement is disseminated to our stockholders and the date the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority completes its review and processing of our name change.  Results of Operations  Comparison of operations for the Three-Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  The Company had net income of $1,186,681 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which represents an increase in net income by $1,200,422 or 8,736.06%, compared with a net loss of $13,741 in the same period of 2015. Components resulting in this increase are discussed below.  Revenues increased by $180,542 or 10.22% from $1,766,547 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,947,089 for the same period of 2016. The increase was mainly due to increase of revenue from rental business.  The cost of revenue decreased by $110,478 or 8.40% from $1,315,549 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,205,071 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decrease of cost under rental business, including the decrease in business tax and addition, and less .repair and maintenance activities.  The gross margin for the rental business was 38.1% and 25.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. This increase is attributable to the Company's effective cost controlling measure due to the economics of scale. The large increase of gross margin was from the management cost fee, contributing 40.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the 36.70% of gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Selling expenses decreased by $15,823or 91.84% from $17,228 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,405 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was due to the cancellation of lease certificate fee by the government in 2016.  General and administrative expenses increased by $110,080 or 28.26% from $389,533 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $499,613 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is mainly because of the addition of the healthcare product sales business.  Reversal of bad debt allowance increased by $1,392,936 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, as the Company's recovery of bad debt increased from $0 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, to $1,392,936 for the comparable period in 2016.  Depreciation and amortization was $3,134 and $2,092 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  Interest expense was $536 and $105,795 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The decrease is mainly because the Company has already paid off certain bank loans in 06/12/2016.  Other income, net increased by $20,007 from $49,909 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $69,916 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The net income (loss) before income taxes was income of $1,700,182 and loss of $13,741 during three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary reason is the increase in recovery of bad debt during the current period.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap $12.30 M     Shares Outstanding 14.06 M     Public Float 2.70 M     Yield HHBT has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

HH Biotechnology Holdings Co (OTCPK:HHBT)
Graham Number
=GURUF("OTCPK:HHBT","Graham Number")

$3.00 (As of Sep. 2016)
Graham Number is a figure that measures a stock's fundamental value by taking into account the company's earnings per share and book value per share. The Graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock. According to the theory, any stock price below the Graham number is considered undervalued, and thus worth investing in.
As of today, the stock price of HH Biotechnology Holdings Co is $1.00. HH Biotechnology Holdings Co's graham number for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 was $3.00. Therefore, HH Biotechnology Holdings Co's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is 0.33.
Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Definition
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
HH Biotechnology Holdings Co's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2015 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI))


=sqrt of (22.5*2.007*0.18)


=2.85



HH Biotechnology Holdings Co's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI) (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5*2.104*0.19)


=3.00



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
HH Biotechnology Holdings Co's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Sep. 2016 )


=1.00/3.00


=0.33

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.

Company Background: HH Biotechnology Holdings Company (OTC: HHBT) was listed on the OTC in 2005. Historically, the Company was engaged in the real estate development and property leasing and management in mainland China . In recent years, the Company repositioned itself and entered the healthy living industry, aiming to build an entity that develops, produces and markets high-quality healthy food, supplements, medicine and cosmetics made from  raw materials from the Company's- own plantation and other strictly-selected suppliers. HH Biotech is placing significant product research and development efforts on macadamia nuts, with the goal of capitaling on the growth trends associated with China's green health industry, bio-science and technology.
Macadamia Nuts: In May 2016, HH Biotech entered into an equity investment agreement with Jiangcheng Sino-Australia Agriculture Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd (“SAAT”), a leading macadamia nut planting company in Yunnan province, resulting in an 11.12% ownership of the total share capital of SAAT. Founded in 2014, SAAT now owns the largest continuous macadamia nut monomer plantation base in the world, with the ability to cultivate over 4,000 acres of land. 
HH Biotech plans to further develop and expand the agricultural lands for Macadamia planting in the Southwest region of China, aiming to become one of the largest macadamia nut suppliers in the world. The Company's goal is to construct three macadamia nut production facilities to maximize total shell fruit processing capacity at each facility. Upon completion of these three facilities, HH Biotech would have multiple product lines with an estimated 10,000 tons nuts (oil & pulp) processing capacity. HH Biotech also works closely with its Japanese counterparts in biotechnology to develop healthy food products, organic foods and nutraceuticals from macadamia.
Perilla: Jidong county in Hei Longjiang province, China is a fine and good region for perilla planting, the company plans to complete an area of 1647.4 acres perilla planting in 2017, and increase the planting area to over 4942.3 acres in 2018, and make an investment in building factory for the production of perilla related products. The company plans to establish HH Biotechnology (China) Co., Ltd in China, and complete the establishment of biotechnology R&D as a fully completed product transformation center.
President Building: President Building: As one of HH Biotech's major real estate projects, the President Building is a modern office building developed in accordance with international standards. The building is located in the central area in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province of China, and adjacent to governmental agencies, offices, and banks. The building covers an area of 8,126 square meters, and the construction area is 77,000 square meters. As of June 30, 2016, the net asset value of the President Building was $28.5 million, which equates to approximately $2.03 per share. As early as 2008, the net asset value from an asset appraisal by a qualified real estate assessment authority increased by $80 million, with a $5.75 increase in the net asset value per share. Taking the appraisal value into account, the net asset value per share is approximately $7.79 per share, which can provide strong financial support for the Company's future development in the healthy living industry.
HH Biotech focuses on the healthy living industry, with green planting technology and product research and development as its core value, to provide safe and high-quality healthy food, supplements, medicine and cosmetics to the world. We firmly believe that longevity can be achieved through science and technology.
