Company history[edit]
The company's initial focus was on the development of single isomers and active metabolites. This concept allowed Barberich and Doug Reedich to generate a patent estate that served the company well for many years. Therapeutically, Sepracor's products were focused on the treatment of central nervous system and respiratory disorders, under the direction of Gunnar Aberg, and John McCullough. The primary source of its revenue was the approximately $600 million annually from its Xopenex franchise of drugs, launched under the marketing leadership of John Simon, with the direct involvement of Medical Communications, under Dean Handley. It is available as a multi-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulized (UDV) form. The insomnia drug Lunesta (eszopiclone) was discovered by Tom Jerussi, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2004, and launched in April 2005 under the marketing leadership of Tim Healy. On February 13, 2006, Sepracor filed a new drug application for Brovana, patented by Gunnar Aberg and John Morley, (also launched under John Simon) to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the launch drugs were manufactured under the leadership of Walter Piskorski.[citation needed]
In September 2016, the company announced it would acquire Cynapsus Therapeutics for approximately $624 million, specifically expanding Sunovians central nervous system drug portfolio. Through the deal, Sunovion would acquire Cynapsus’ Phase III Parkinson’s disease candidate drug APL-130277.[3]
Acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo[edit]
On September 2, 2009, shares of Sepracor were halted on the Nasdaq due to pending news of a takeover bid by Japanese drugmaker Dainippon Sumitomo. According to the Associated Press, Dainippon planned to offer $2.6 billion for Sepracor, a nearly 28% premium over the stock's closing price on September 1.[4] Aside from acquiring such drugs as Lunesta and Xopenex, analysts said the acquisition would give Dainippon access to "Sepracor's sales force of roughly 1,200", which would open an avenue for the Japanese company to market its drugs in the United States.[5] Sepracor was set to face stiff generic competition from its expiring patents (Xopenex in 2012 and Lunesta in 2014), and had failed to discover any viable drugs in nearly 10 years.[6][7]
A formal announcement of the acquisition was made on October 12, 2010, which stated that Sunovion would be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.[1]
Beneficiaries, partners, and subsidiaries[edit]
Eslicarbazepine acetate[edit]
In 2008, Bial agreed with Sepracor that its antiepileptic eslicarbazepine acetate (trade name Aptiom) would be produced in Sepracor's facilities and supervised by Bial.[8]
Omnaris and Alvesco[edit]
The company acquired Omnaris and Alvesco for $150M upfront and an addition $280M in potential milestones. Alvesco revenues for Q4'08 were -$0.3 million because returns from the "stocking" in Q3'08 exceeded the demand in Q4'08. The company disclosed a 2009 forecast of $25–$40M for Omnaris and $10–15M for Alvesco; yielding a combined total of $35M-$55M in year 2 of a launch. However, revenues continue to be dismal, prompting criticisms and concerns over the purchase price relative to minuscule income.

Omnaris and Alvesco[edit]
The company acquired Omnaris and Alvesco for $150M upfront and an addition $280M in potential milestones. Alvesco revenues for Q4'08 were -$0.3 million because returns from the "stocking" in Q3'08 exceeded the demand in Q4'08. The company disclosed a 2009 forecast of $25–$40M for Omnaris and $10–15M for Alvesco; yielding a combined total of $35M-$55M in year 2 of a launch. However, revenues continue to be dismal, prompting criticisms and concerns over the purchase price relative to minuscule income.

Company history[edit]
The company's initial focus was on the development of single isomers and active metabolites. This concept allowed Barberich and Doug Reedich to generate a patent estate that served the company well for many years. Therapeutically, Sepracor's products were focused on the treatment of central nervous system and respiratory disorders, under the direction of Gunnar Aberg, and John McCullough. The primary source of its revenue was the approximately $600 million annually from its Xopenex franchise of drugs, launched under the marketing leadership of John Simon, with the direct involvement of Medical Communications, under Dean Handley. It is available as a multi-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulized (UDV) form. The insomnia drug Lunesta (eszopiclone) was discovered by Tom Jerussi, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2004, and launched in April 2005 under the marketing leadership of Tim Healy. On February 13, 2006, Sepracor filed a new drug application for Brovana, patented by Gunnar Aberg and John Morley, (also launched under John Simon) to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the launch drugs were manufactured under the leadership of Walter Piskorski.[citation needed]
In September 2016, the company announced it would acquire Cynapsus Therapeutics for approximately $624 million, specifically expanding Sunovians central nervous system drug portfolio. Through the deal, Sunovion would acquire Cynapsus’ Phase III Parkinson’s disease candidate drug APL-130277.[3]
Acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo[edit]
On September 2, 2009, shares of Sepracor were halted on the Nasdaq due to pending news of a takeover bid by Japanese drugmaker Dainippon Sumitomo. According to the Associated Press, Dainippon planned to offer $2.6 billion for Sepracor, a nearly 28% premium over the stock's closing price on September 1.[4] Aside from acquiring such drugs as Lunesta and Xopenex, analysts said the acquisition would give Dainippon access to "Sepracor's sales force of roughly 1,200", which would open an avenue for the Japanese company to market its drugs in the United States.[5] Sepracor was set to face stiff generic competition from its expiring patents (Xopenex in 2012 and Lunesta in 2014), and had failed to discover any viable drugs in nearly 10 years.[6][7]
A formal announcement of the acquisition was made on October 12, 2010, which stated that Sunovion would be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.[1]
Beneficiaries, partners, and subsidiaries[edit]
Eslicarbazepine acetate[edit]
In 2008, Bial agreed with Sepracor that its antiepileptic eslicarbazepine acetate (trade name Aptiom) would be produced in Sepracor's facilities and supervised by Bial.[8]
Omnaris and Alvesco[edit]
The company acquired Omnaris and Alvesco for $150M upfront and an addition $280M in potential milestones. Alvesco revenues for Q4'08 were -$0.3 million because returns from the "stocking" in Q3'08 exceeded the demand in Q4'08. The company disclosed a 2009 forecast of $25–$40M for Omnaris and $10–15M for Alvesco; yielding a combined total of $35M-$55M in year 2 of a launch. However, revenues continue to be dismal, prompting criticisms and concerns over the purchase price relative to minuscule income.

Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Key Developments

Sunovion’s Latuda® (Lurasidone HCI) Receives Health Canada Approval to Treat Adolescents with Schizophrenia
Jul 21 17
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that Health Canada approved the Supplemental New Drug Submission (SNDS) for Latuda® (lurasidone HCI) for the management of the manifestations of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. LATUDA is currently indicated in Canada for the management of the manifestations of schizophrenia and the acute management of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. The approval is based on results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-week study in which adolescent patients with schizophrenia received fixed doses of LATUDA 40 mg/day, LATUDA 80 mg/day or placebo. At study endpoint, patients treated with LATUDA 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia compared to placebo. LATUDA was also generally well tolerated with limited effects on weight and metabolic parameters.


Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. Announces FDA Acceptance for Review of New Drug Application Resubmission for SUN-101/eFlow (Glycopyrrolate) for the Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Jun 30 17
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the resubmission of the New Drug Application for SUN-101/eFlow® (glycopyrrolate) for the long-term, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. This resubmission is in response to the Complete Response Letter Sunovion received from the FDA on May 26, 2017. The expected action date by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) is December 15, 2017. The NDA for SUN-101/eFlow is supported by data from clinical trials in the GOLDEN (Glycopyrrolate for Obstructive Lung Disease via Electronic Nebulizer) program, which demonstrated a statistically significant change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) versus placebo in addition to safety and tolerability in a long-term study. Sunovion was not required by the FDA to conduct any additional clinical studies prior to NDA resubmission.


Sunovion Announces Utibron™ Neohaler® Inhalation Powder Data Showing Lung Function and Health-Related Quality of Life Improvement in Patients with Moderate-To-Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
May 23 17
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that multiple data analyses from two Phase 3 studies demonstrating that Utibron™ Neohaler® (indacaterol/glycopyrrolate) inhalation powder improved lung function, health-related quality of life (HRQL), dyspnea and night-time symptoms compared to placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were presented at the 2017 American Thoracic Society International Conference (ATS 2017) held May 19-24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Findings from the FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 pivotal efficacy and safety studies, as well as from the FLIGHT3 long-term safety study, were included in nine posters for UTIBRON NEOHALER presented at the meeting. UTIBRON NEOHALER is a twice-daily combination long-acting beta2 agonist (indacaterol) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist (glycopyrrolate) (LABA/LAMA) for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in people with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. UTIBRON NEOHALER is not indicated to treat asthma or for the relief of sudden symptoms of COPD. Key data presented at ATS 2017 include: A pooled analysis of efficacy results from FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies, which showed that UTIBRON NEOHALER demonstrated significant and sustained improvement in lung function compared to placebo, as measured by time-weighted mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Treatment differences between UTIBRON NEOHALER and placebo ranged from 0.159 to 0.179 L on Day 1 and from 0.223 to 0.281 L at Week 12 (all p-values). Results from a pooled analysis of HRQL data from FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies showed that patients treated with UTIBRON NEOHALER for moderate-to-severe COPD had statistically and clinically significant improvements in disease specific health related quality of life, as measured by the St.  George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and dyspnea, as measured by the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), compared to placebo treated patients after 12 weeks of treatment. These improvements were seen in all patients, irrespective of age, gender, severity of disease, smoking status or baseline use of drugs like corticosteroids. Two pooled analyses of FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 trials evaluated the effect of UTIBRON NEOHALER on patient-reported daily total COPD symptoms, night-time use of rescue medication and sleep disturbance. One of these presentations showed that patients treated with UTIBRON NEOHALER reported significant reduction in their total night-time COPD symptoms score versus placebo over the 12-week treatment period. A separate pooled analysis showed that 12 weeks of treatment with UTIBRON NEOHALER significantly reduced the use of rescue medications at night and significantly increased the number of nights with no awakenings, compared to placebo. Specifically, a significant reduction in the number of night-time rescue medication puffs use (treatment difference: -0.50; standard error (SE): +/- 0.06; p < 0.001) and significant increases in the percentage of nights with no awakenings (treatment difference: 7.7; SE: +/- 1.58; p < 0.001) compared to placebo, were seen after 12 weeks of treatment.

Hands On!
2016 marked the fifth year of Sunovion’s annual community service program, Hands On! Since the inception
              of the program in 2012, Sunovion employees have volunteered more
              than 20,000 hours to support youth organizations and community service efforts around our headquarters,
              located in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and its office in Fort Lee,
              New Jersey.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (former NASDAQ: SEPR), known until October 12, 2010 as Sepracor, Inc. prior to its acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma of Japan,[1] is a pharmaceutical company founded in 1984 by Timothy J. Barberich, Steve Matson, and Bob Bratzler. It was originally located in Princeton, New Jersey and then re-located to Marlborough, Massachusetts.[2] In addition to its headquarters location in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Sunovion has locations in London, England, Mississauga, Ontario Canada, and Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Company history[edit]
The company's initial focus was on the development of single isomers and active metabolites. This concept allowed Barberich and Doug Reedich to generate a patent estate that served the company well for many years. Therapeutically, Sepracor's products were focused on the treatment of central nervous system and respiratory disorders, under the direction of Gunnar Aberg, and John McCullough. The primary source of its revenue was the approximately $600 million annually from its Xopenex franchise of drugs, launched under the marketing leadership of John Simon, with the direct involvement of Medical Communications, under Dean Handley. It is available as a multi-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulized (UDV) form. The insomnia drug Lunesta (eszopiclone) was discovered by Tom Jerussi, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2004, and launched in April 2005 under the marketing leadership of Tim Healy. On February 13, 2006, Sepracor filed a new drug application for Brovana, patented by Gunnar Aberg and John Morley, (also launched under John Simon) to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the launch drugs were manufactured under the leadership of Walter Piskorski.[citation needed]
In September 2016, the company announced it would acquire Cynapsus Therapeutics for approximately $624 million, specifically expanding Sunovians central nervous system drug portfolio. Through the deal, Sunovion would acquire Cynapsus’ Phase III Parkinson’s disease candidate drug APL-130277.[3]
Acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo[edit]
On September 2, 2009, shares of Sepracor were halted on the Nasdaq due to pending news of a takeover bid by Japanese drugmaker Dainippon Sumitomo. According to the Associated Press, Dainippon planned to offer $2.6 billion for Sepracor, a nearly 28% premium over the stock's closing price on September 1.[4] Aside from acquiring such drugs as Lunesta and Xopenex, analysts said the acquisition would give Dainippon access to "Sepracor's sales force of roughly 1,200", which would open an avenue for the Japanese company to market its drugs in the United States.[5] Sepracor was set to face stiff generic competition from its expiring patents (Xopenex in 2012 and Lunesta in 2014), and had failed to discover any viable drugs in nearly 10 years.[6][7]
A formal announcement of the acquisition was made on October 12, 2010, which stated that Sunovion would be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.[1]
Beneficiaries, partners, and subsidiaries[edit]
Eslicarbazepine acetate[edit]
In 2008, Bial agreed with Sepracor that its antiepileptic eslicarbazepine acetate (trade name Aptiom) would be produced in Sepracor's facilities and supervised by Bial.[8]
Omnaris and Alvesco[edit]
The company acquired Omnaris and Alvesco for $150M upfront and an addition $280M in potential milestones. Alvesco revenues for Q4'08 were -$0.3 million because returns from the "stocking" in Q3'08 exceeded the demand in Q4'08. The company disclosed a 2009 forecast of $25–$40M for Omnaris and $10–15M for Alvesco; yielding a combined total of $35M-$55M in year 2 of a launch. However, revenues continue to be dismal, prompting criticisms and concerns over the purchase price relative to minuscule income.
