Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Terry Peterson16620 N 40th St Ste G3Phoenix, AZ 85032(602) 953-1850DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Terry Peterson DC6750 E Broadway RdMesa, AZ 85206(480) 396-2484Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Fife, Terry D, MD240 W Thomas RdPhoenix, AZ 85013(602) 406-6262Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Eric Peters DR5601 W Eugie AveGlendale, AZ 85304(602) 439-2800Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Pederson Kent DR7117 E Mercer LnScottsdale, AZ 85254(480) 951-7581Physicians & SurgeonsSponsored LinksShowing1-5
