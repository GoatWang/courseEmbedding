Mangrove Information
Fund Information







Mangrove Partners is a value-oriented investment manager. Our investment objective is to organically compound net worth while minimizing the chances of a permanent loss of capital.






The Mangrove Name
Mangroves are a shrub and tree species that are remarkably tough. Most live on muddy soil, but some also grow on sand, peat, and coral rock. They live in water up to 100 times saltier than most other plants can tolerate. Growing where land and water meet, mangroves bear the brunt of ocean-borne storms and hurricanes. Similarly, Mangrove Partners seeks to be resilient in its hostile environment, the financial markets.
