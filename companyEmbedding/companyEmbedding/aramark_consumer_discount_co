FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

 ordered two days ago and still has not been pulled
 "I own a concession business, and ordered from Aramark. I just checked and still the order has not been pulled as of now. Very bad service.If you don't have to buy from this company don't.They make it sound good but very poor service.I live 10 minutes from the warehouse and they tell me it would take 14 days to deliver my order.They need to go out of business or do some house cleaning."

 Incompetence 
 "I am a Dining Room Manager at a Retirement Community in Dallas Texas. We signed on with Aramark and our first delivery was Friday June 30th. We received half an order and no chef's coats for both properties. However we did receive laundry bags with maggots. We  were told they would be back and bring the rest of the delivery but no show. We were also promised we would have another delivery Monday. I waited almost the whole day but nothing. I called a woman and placed an order for both properties  and she passed it on. Nothing came. I panicked because fourth of July was the next day  and we had many reservations. I had to go to our other property and thankfully they had in house linen.The next day (4th of July) Our District Manager( Christian Prater) brought us 200 napkins and 300 for across the street. When talking to him he commented we normally don't have new accounts at the end of the period. He is trying to justify in why this happened.......Are you kidding me, why would he even say that to a new customer. I then went back and got more linen  If I hadn't gotten the other linen I would have been in so much trouble. I finally talk to Christian Prater  (DM) and he delivered some linen on Wednesday . By the way his version of an invoice was texting me the numbers. By this time no chefs coats. All of our cooks were using their own clothes to work in. By Friday we were promised yet again we would have it delivered between 9 and 11. I called Christian @ 12:00 and he said he was working on it. He said he didn't have the  full order. We are going round and round and I finally got off the phone. I call at 2:00 still no order. Gave me the same run around and he said he would definitely deliver it. In the meantime I talk to David Null and he said he would check on it. He is our sales person and has no idea what is going on. By 3:30 or so he finally arrives. This man pulls up in the front of our property and walks in the front door and brings our delivery. Is this his first time on the job??? This is not a regular business. You have many residents with wheel chairs and walkers and he has his huge ugly white Aramark truck in the way of the people who pay a substantial amount of money to live here   and because of his truck they are having difficulty getting around him and his vehicle. Needless to say I got several calls asking me to have this truck removed.  I finally meet Christian only to tell me my chefs coats are on back order and we will not receive them. We have only been with them one week and they are already having issues with the order. I ask him for an invoice and he doesn't have one and he said he is keeping track of it. I asked him I want a copy of what he brought me and he asked me for a piece of paper and he preceded to write it on the paper. Are you kidding me??? The first order is half filled, He texts me the next amount he delivered   and then he writes it on the paper only because I insisted. And you call this professional??   I can not believe this is how a huge company like Aramark conducts business. I called the 1 800 number and the customer service women were great and I asked to speak to  the General Manager , he was in a meeting but assured me he would respond. I called three times and nothing. I guess we are not a big enough company to warrant a call back.  Needless to say I do not have a good first impression of this company or its Management. "

 Inventory Status is Incorrect
 "I purchased pants needed in a rush.  Difficult size.  Found them in stock at Aramark.  Paid for Express shipping, guaranteeing delivery within 4 days.  When I did not receive pants or a shipping confirmation I reviewed an email titled "Your Order is in Process" on which it stated the shipping status is "On order, Estimated Warehouse Delivery 2-3 weeks".  I lost precious time by their incorrect reporting of items being in stock when not.  "

 Horrible customer service - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY
 "Aramark is a very unprofessional and unhappy uniform company.  They have poor quality clothes and even worse customer service. Paul Watson is a very angry man. We entered into a contract with them. It took them several months to get everyone sized correctly. They charged us for jackets that we did not use. They lose our clothes and then charge us for them saying that we lose them. They only bring a portion of our clothes back which leaves us wearing our personal clothes. It looks like they hang our shirts up wet and on wire hangers. The result is a "horn" looking peak on the shoulders that does not go away. They took forever getting names on some of our technician's shirts. Our employees complain constantly about the shirts being itchy and uncomfortable. I was told by Paul Watson that if I tried to go with another uniform company that he would go the "legal route" and it would cost me over $5,000.00. They are not concerned with pleasing their customers. Paul Watson tried to make me feel that we had done something wrong. He is clearly used to talking down to customers and trying to intimidate them. They only want to keep them in a contract for the money.  I would stay clear of Aramark.  If negative stars were and option they would get them. "

 Terrible Customer Service
 "Placed an order on 07/21 for 3 pair of pants & 3 shirts, ALL IN STOCK. No extras, just plain shirts. As of 03/02, no shipping info. Called customer service. Automated phone system wasn't bad. Got a real person in less than 3 minutes. After providing more information than would normally be needed to type in an order # and customer #, "ahh, your order is still in process. Was anything on backorder ?" Not according to your website when i placed the order. " Ahh, it should ship soon." It should have shipped last week, do you have an estimated shipping date ? "Ahh, soon. Maybe tomorrow or next week."  REALLY ??"

 "Purchased a $90 coat for $25 on sale. They marked it as "backordered" for almost 9 months. Now it's "canceled." So I called to see if they could honor my price with a different color of the same coat (all sizes and colors were originally on sale).Of course not. Why did they not tell me that when I could have swapped out to another color, etc., while it was still on sale.Will never deal with them again. Customer No-Service did their thing by trying to sell me an almost-$200 coat instead with about 10% discount. They said, "It's close to what you originally ordered.""

 "On our last order we purchased eight shirts and eight pairs of pants.  They charged me $107.94 in freight to my facility in Anchorage, Alaska.  These items could been shipped in a large USPS flat rate priority mail box and the freight would have been approximately $20.  I've spoken to four different people at Aramark, none of whom can do anything about adjusting disputed freight charge.  I'm on the verge of terminating my business relationship with this company since customer service is nonexistent."

 "Will never order from Aramark again.  The last batch of work shirts came with small pockets and a lot of loose threads.  They ARE TERRIBLE!!!  Can't even fix them.  Aramark says they have several manufacturers making the clothes - probably all overseas.  Aramark - go back to American made products!!!"

 "If you are planning on ordering uniforms through Aramark, don't.  This is the most unethical company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  They rope you in the door with a decent price, and within six months will more than double the cost.  Anyone you try to talk to about your problems with service could care less.  Buyer beware, don't fall in to the trap.  This company is a joke!"

 "These guys have very poor customer service.  You call in an order and you never receive it because they lost it or never submitted it.  You receive an order but never an invoice.  I've had to request an invoice for each of my orders since 2008 despite repeated calls to my account manager.  And sometimes it takes several calls just for one invoice!I made a call about my coffee machine not working and 2 weeks later, still nobody has showed up.  It even sprayed one of our employees with scalding water because the coffee packet got stuck and didn't eject into the catch bin.  Are they just screaming for a lawsuit?I don't know how they stay in business - their customer service sucks!"

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
