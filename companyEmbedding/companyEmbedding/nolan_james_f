Process for making photovoltaic devices and resultant product



Patent number:  5536333
                                            

Abstract:  A process and apparatus (70) for making a large area photovoltaic device (22) that is capable of generating low cost electrical power. The apparatus (70) for performing the process includes an enclosure (126) providing a controlled environment in which an oven (156) is located. At least one and preferably a plurality of deposition stations (74,76,78) provide heated vapors of semiconductor material within the oven (156) for continuous elevated temperature deposition of semiconductor material on a sheet substrate (24) including a glass sheet (26) conveyed within the oven. The sheet substrate (24) is conveyed on a roller conveyor (184) within the oven (156) and the semiconductor material whose main layer (82) is cadmium telluride is deposited on an upwardly facing surface (28) of the substrate by each deposition station from a location within the oven above the roller conveyor.

Method and circuit for generating gray scale in gaseous discharge panels



Patent number:  4002828
                                            

Abstract:  A method and circuit for obtaining gray scale in gas discharge display panels which uses only one discharge site per resolution element, does not require extensive electronic memory and provides a continuous, broad intensity range. A maintain voltage is applied to all elements of the matrix display panel which has a magnitude somewhat less than the lower limit of the bistable region in which gas discharge panels are normally operated. Thus, a site cannot be turned "on" in the normal sense of initiating a sequence of discharges which continues indefinitely. However, the application of a trigger voltage can initiate a sequence of discharges which continues for a substantial number of cycles before dying out. The number of cycles for which the discharge sequence persists depends on the magnitude and duration of the addressing trigger voltage.
