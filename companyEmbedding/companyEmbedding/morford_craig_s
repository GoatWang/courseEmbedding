Craig S. Morford

From SourceWatch


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Craig S. Morford was named July 18, 2007, to be Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice to replace Paul J. McNulty. Morford, who is currently interim U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee[1], "has something of a high-profile background -- he led the prosecution of former Rep. James Trafficant (D-OH) and the Department's 2004 internal review of how prosecutors handled the case of three men accused of being part of a terrorist 'sleeper cell' in the Detroit area."[2]
Prior to the 2007 firings of U.S. prosecutors by the Bush administration, Morford was "one of 15 prosecutors who took office after appointment by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales but without U.S. Senate confirmation."[3][4]
"By definition[5], it would appear that Craig Morford must be a 'loyal Bushie.'[6] And as we know, loyalty to Bush is invariably accompanied by incompetence on the job," egalia of Tennessee Guerilla Women Blogspot wrote March 30, 2007,[7]

Personal life[edit]
Craig Morford grew up in Schenectady, New York graduated in 1981 with an Economics degree from Hope College, a small liberal arts school in Holland, Michigan. He was a member of the Cosmopolitan Fraternity. He graduated from Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana in 1984.[1]
Career[edit]
Morford spent most of his career as a federal prosecutor pursuing public-corruption and organized crime cases in Cleveland, Ohio.
As an Internal Revenue Service attorney, he helped win a civil tax evasion judgment in 1987 against James A. Traficant, elected to Congress in 1984, for failing to pay taxes on $163,000 received from mob figures. Traficant had been acquitted on related criminal charges.[1]
After joining the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Cleveland, Morford helped convict the nation's largest pornography distributor, Reuben Sturman, on tax evasion charges in 1990.[2]
From 1996-2002, Morford prosecuted more than 70 cases resulting in the convictions of elected officials, law enforcement officers and mob figures in northern Ohio. Those convicted included three county judges, Mahoning County Prosecutor James A. Philomena, Mahoning County Sheriff Philip Chance, and Youngstown mob boss Lenine “Lennie” Strollo, along with 28 associates.[1]
In 2002, Morford was lead prosecutor in the second criminal case against Traficant, then in his ninth term as a Democratic Congress member from Youngstown, Ohio. Traficant was convicted on charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in prison.[3]
In 2004, Morford led a court-ordered Justice Department review of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in a major terrorism case that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. Morford’s report concluded that prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence – e-mails, photographs, witness statements and other material – that cast doubt on the government’s case. In a rare admission of error, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss charges against two convicted defendants.[4]
In 2006, Morford led a task force that prosecuted Toledo coin dealer Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser convicted of stealing from a rare-coin fund that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Then-Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded guilty in a separate state case to misdemeanor ethics charges for accepting gifts from Noe.[5]
Morford served briefly as U.S. Attorney in Detroit and Nashville. He was named acting Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, in July 2007, and mentioned as a possible nominee for Attorney General.[6]
While acting Deputy Attorney General, Morford wrote what's referred to as the "Morford Memo" establishing new guidelines for how federal prosecutors select and use compliance monitors in corporate crime settlements.[7] The department had come under fire when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie required a company to name former Attorney General John Ashcroft to a lucrative monitoring contract.[8]
In May, 2008, Morford joined Cardinal Health, a large healthcare services company in Dublin, Ohio, and is currently Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, overseeing legal, compliance, regulatory and government affairs.[9]

In 2006, Morford led a task force that prosecuted Toledo coin dealer Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser convicted of stealing from a rare-coin fund that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Then-Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded guilty in a separate state case to misdemeanor ethics charges for accepting gifts from Noe.[5]
Morford served briefly as U.S. Attorney in Detroit and Nashville. He was named acting Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, in July 2007, and mentioned as a possible nominee for Attorney General.[6]
While acting Deputy Attorney General, Morford wrote what's referred to as the "Morford Memo" establishing new guidelines for how federal prosecutors select and use compliance monitors in corporate crime settlements.[7] The department had come under fire when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie required a company to name former Attorney General John Ashcroft to a lucrative monitoring contract.[8]
In May, 2008, Morford joined Cardinal Health, a large healthcare services company in Dublin, Ohio, and is currently Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, overseeing legal, compliance, regulatory and government affairs.[9]

Personal life[edit]
Craig Morford grew up in Schenectady, New York graduated in 1981 with an Economics degree from Hope College, a small liberal arts school in Holland, Michigan. He was a member of the Cosmopolitan Fraternity. He graduated from Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana in 1984.[1]
Career[edit]
Morford spent most of his career as a federal prosecutor pursuing public-corruption and organized crime cases in Cleveland, Ohio.
As an Internal Revenue Service attorney, he helped win a civil tax evasion judgment in 1987 against James A. Traficant, elected to Congress in 1984, for failing to pay taxes on $163,000 received from mob figures. Traficant had been acquitted on related criminal charges.[1]
After joining the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Cleveland, Morford helped convict the nation's largest pornography distributor, Reuben Sturman, on tax evasion charges in 1990.[2]
From 1996-2002, Morford prosecuted more than 70 cases resulting in the convictions of elected officials, law enforcement officers and mob figures in northern Ohio. Those convicted included three county judges, Mahoning County Prosecutor James A. Philomena, Mahoning County Sheriff Philip Chance, and Youngstown mob boss Lenine “Lennie” Strollo, along with 28 associates.[1]
In 2002, Morford was lead prosecutor in the second criminal case against Traficant, then in his ninth term as a Democratic Congress member from Youngstown, Ohio. Traficant was convicted on charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in prison.[3]
In 2004, Morford led a court-ordered Justice Department review of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in a major terrorism case that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. Morford’s report concluded that prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence – e-mails, photographs, witness statements and other material – that cast doubt on the government’s case. In a rare admission of error, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss charges against two convicted defendants.[4]
In 2006, Morford led a task force that prosecuted Toledo coin dealer Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser convicted of stealing from a rare-coin fund that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Then-Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded guilty in a separate state case to misdemeanor ethics charges for accepting gifts from Noe.[5]
Morford served briefly as U.S. Attorney in Detroit and Nashville. He was named acting Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, in July 2007, and mentioned as a possible nominee for Attorney General.[6]
While acting Deputy Attorney General, Morford wrote what's referred to as the "Morford Memo" establishing new guidelines for how federal prosecutors select and use compliance monitors in corporate crime settlements.[7] The department had come under fire when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie required a company to name former Attorney General John Ashcroft to a lucrative monitoring contract.[8]

Personal life[edit]
Craig Morford grew up in Schenectady, New York graduated in 1981 with an Economics degree from Hope College, a small liberal arts school in Holland, Michigan. He was a member of the Cosmopolitan Fraternity. He graduated from Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana in 1984.[1]
Career[edit]
Morford spent most of his career as a federal prosecutor pursuing public-corruption and organized crime cases in Cleveland, Ohio.
As an Internal Revenue Service attorney, he helped win a civil tax evasion judgment in 1987 against James A. Traficant, elected to Congress in 1984, for failing to pay taxes on $163,000 received from mob figures. Traficant had been acquitted on related criminal charges.[1]
After joining the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Cleveland, Morford helped convict the nation's largest pornography distributor, Reuben Sturman, on tax evasion charges in 1990.[2]
From 1996-2002, Morford prosecuted more than 70 cases resulting in the convictions of elected officials, law enforcement officers and mob figures in northern Ohio. Those convicted included three county judges, Mahoning County Prosecutor James A. Philomena, Mahoning County Sheriff Philip Chance, and Youngstown mob boss Lenine “Lennie” Strollo, along with 28 associates.[1]
In 2002, Morford was lead prosecutor in the second criminal case against Traficant, then in his ninth term as a Democratic Congress member from Youngstown, Ohio. Traficant was convicted on charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in prison.[3]
In 2004, Morford led a court-ordered Justice Department review of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in a major terrorism case that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. Morford’s report concluded that prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence – e-mails, photographs, witness statements and other material – that cast doubt on the government’s case. In a rare admission of error, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss charges against two convicted defendants.[4]
In 2006, Morford led a task force that prosecuted Toledo coin dealer Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser convicted of stealing from a rare-coin fund that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Then-Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded guilty in a separate state case to misdemeanor ethics charges for accepting gifts from Noe.[5]
Morford served briefly as U.S. Attorney in Detroit and Nashville. He was named acting Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, in July 2007, and mentioned as a possible nominee for Attorney General.[6]
While acting Deputy Attorney General, Morford wrote what's referred to as the "Morford Memo" establishing new guidelines for how federal prosecutors select and use compliance monitors in corporate crime settlements.[7] The department had come under fire when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie required a company to name former Attorney General John Ashcroft to a lucrative monitoring contract.[8]
In May, 2008, Morford joined Cardinal Health, a large healthcare services company in Dublin, Ohio, and is currently Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, overseeing legal, compliance, regulatory and government affairs.[9]

Personal life[edit]
Craig Morford grew up in Schenectady, New York graduated in 1981 with an Economics degree from Hope College, a small liberal arts school in Holland, Michigan. He was a member of the Cosmopolitan Fraternity. He graduated from Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana in 1984.[1]
Career[edit]
Morford spent most of his career as a federal prosecutor pursuing public-corruption and organized crime cases in Cleveland, Ohio.
As an Internal Revenue Service attorney, he helped win a civil tax evasion judgment in 1987 against James A. Traficant, elected to Congress in 1984, for failing to pay taxes on $163,000 received from mob figures. Traficant had been acquitted on related criminal charges.[1]
After joining the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Cleveland, Morford helped convict the nation's largest pornography distributor, Reuben Sturman, on tax evasion charges in 1990.[2]
From 1996-2002, Morford prosecuted more than 70 cases resulting in the convictions of elected officials, law enforcement officers and mob figures in northern Ohio. Those convicted included three county judges, Mahoning County Prosecutor James A. Philomena, Mahoning County Sheriff Philip Chance, and Youngstown mob boss Lenine “Lennie” Strollo, along with 28 associates.[1]
In 2002, Morford was lead prosecutor in the second criminal case against Traficant, then in his ninth term as a Democratic Congress member from Youngstown, Ohio. Traficant was convicted on charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion and sentenced to eight years in prison.[3]
In 2004, Morford led a court-ordered Justice Department review of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in a major terrorism case that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001. Morford’s report concluded that prosecutors had improperly withheld evidence – e-mails, photographs, witness statements and other material – that cast doubt on the government’s case. In a rare admission of error, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss charges against two convicted defendants.[4]
In 2006, Morford led a task force that prosecuted Toledo coin dealer Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser convicted of stealing from a rare-coin fund that he managed for the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation. Then-Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, pleaded guilty in a separate state case to misdemeanor ethics charges for accepting gifts from Noe.[5]
Morford served briefly as U.S. Attorney in Detroit and Nashville. He was named acting Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, in July 2007, and mentioned as a possible nominee for Attorney General.[6]
While acting Deputy Attorney General, Morford wrote what's referred to as the "Morford Memo" establishing new guidelines for how federal prosecutors select and use compliance monitors in corporate crime settlements.[7] The department had come under fire when then-U.S. Attorney Chris Christie required a company to name former Attorney General John Ashcroft to a lucrative monitoring contract.[8]
In May, 2008, Morford joined Cardinal Health, a large healthcare services company in Dublin, Ohio, and is currently Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, overseeing legal, compliance, regulatory and government affairs.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
