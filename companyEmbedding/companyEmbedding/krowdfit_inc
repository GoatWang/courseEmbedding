Improved Eating Habits
Lost Weight

Improved Sleep
Walking More


By rewarding our members for logging their food we help educate them on the quality and quantity of food they consume during a day and in turn give them the information needed to begin making smarter, healthier choices that lead to improved diet and weight loss.
By incentivizing activity, steps, food logging and sleep our members are provided the insights and tools to help them modify existing bad behaviors related to diet and exercise.  This in turn leads to an increase in acivity and smarter food choices that drive sustained weight loss and long-term behavioral change.
When you living a healthy active lifestyle you begin to have more engery because a body in motion stays in motion.  It's a perpetual cycle that builds upon itself the healthier you become. 
Rewarding people for getting their sleep is one of the most fun rewards we offer.  It is also one of the most importnat ones too.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 35 percent of people are sleep deprived. And when you consider that the statistic for obesity is nearly identical, it’s easy to connect the dots and discover that the connection is not a coincidence.Not sleeping enough—less than seven hours of sleep per night—can reduce and undo the benefits of dieting, according to research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
Many people don't know how good or poorly they are sleeping until  they begin tracking it on a consistent basis and once they do they can begin to make changes that improve their sleep and overall health.
The goal of KrowdFit is to encourage people to move more and at less.  We simply want people to pay attention to how inactive they may be and take action.  The fact that our members are walking more is a great testimate to KrowdFit's ability to get people up off their butts!
Physical activity doesn't need to be complicated. Something as simple as a daily brisk walk can help you live a healthier life.
For example, regular brisk walking can help you:

Maintain a healthy weight
Prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes
Strengthen your bones
Lift your mood
Improve your balance and coordination

The faster, farther and more frequently you walk, the greater the benefits!

There is no silver bullet, change occurs over time, step by step which is why we built KrowdFit to reward the “EFFORT” our members make to consistently engage in healthy activities related to Sleep, Diet and Exercise.  We are not rewarding the person who loses the most weight, nor are we rewarding the fittest person.  We believe if you reward the effort the results will follow!


 Create a habit
Existing bad habits are not eliminated, they are modified.  KrowdFit's goal is to reinforce and reward small, achievable steps that lead to long-term behavioral change.  Once these new habits are in place, you can focus on maintaining good health and still be rewarded!


  Develop daily routine
We built KrowdFit to encourage and reward daily activities, such as sleep, steps, food logging and physical activity.  We don't care what you do, we just want you move!  Go for a walk, Zumba, cycle, hike, swim, Crossfit, Tennis, anything, just do something and we'll reward the "effort" you make to change your lifestyle and improve your health.


 Get social
64% of participants in a wellness program push themselves harder if they work out with others. Exercising with friends adds Motivation, Accountability & Camaraderie.  Give it a try and invite your friends to join the KROWD!




 Be rewarded
Money Talks!   We believe in rewarding our members with cash and let them decide how to spend it, donate it or save it.  Our members can win all KrowdFit rewards multiple times, they just can't win the same reward in back to back periods.  So KrowdFit rewards are unlimited!


  Have fun
If you're not having fun, what's the point?  So, find an exercise routine you like to do and do it often.  When you get bored, try something new.


 Share your success
Don't be shy; we want to highlight your success with the rest of the KROWD!  Your efforts to engage in a healthy, active lifestyle can inspire others, so make sure to tell us about the milestones you've achieved and be sure to share them with your friends, family and colleagues too.











KrowdFit You Sweat...We Pay!™

	KrowdFit is a proven, patent pending wellness rewards program that focuses on rewarding the "Effort" our members make to live a healthy, active lifestyle.
	

	 KrowdFit is available to individuals, corporations, communities and health advocates and incorporates state of the art biometric tools, plus an unlimited cash rewards pool that is powered by the KROWD!

It's never too late to Join the KROWD!
Athlete
Right on, you’re already living a healthy active lifestyle!  Don’t you think it’s about time you got rewarded for all the hard work and healthy choices you make every day?  We do, that’s why we built KrowdFit!  Just think a $5,000 quarterly win could mean a new road bike or mountain bike a monthly win could mean new pair of running shoes, etc…  It’s like found money for doing stuff you already love to do…work out!
Couch Potato
We feel you, we’ve all been there at one point or another.  The hardest thing to do sometimes is simply to “start” a new routine, but once you get going it becomes easier and easier to make it happen!  This is why we’ve built KrowdFit to reward the effort you make to get off the couch, get some activity, get some steps, track your sleep and watch the food you eat.  Over time, you will become a much healthier, happier and productive person and you’ll win some cash along the way too!
 








Become a body in motion!
There is no such thing as one perfect workout and next to the food we put in our mouths, there's simply no better prescription for youthfulness inside and out, than regular physical activity.  Our goal at KrowdFit is to reward you for the effot you make to live a healthy, active lifestyle.  We don't care what you do to stay fit, we just want you to keep on doing it and along the way win some cash!  So get moving!

After sedentary men and women turn 40 yrs old, they begin to lose on average 5%-10% of their muscle mass every decade.
People who sit for a high proportion of the day have a 24% greater risk of developing colon cancer, a 32% higher risk of endometrial cancer regardless of how much they exercised.





 
Daily rigorous physical activity not only helps strengthen bones and the heart but also teachs balance, critical in preventing falls that are a leading cause of death as we age.  The ability to exercise remains the single most powerful predictor of longevity.  If you can't walk a quarter mile in five minutes, your chance of dying within three years is 30% greater than that of faster walkers.  Humans are designed to be physically active thorughout their lives, so shoot for at least three 30 minute workouts weekly and break a sweat.  Add a half hour per week of weight lifting and another half hour of stretching and finally, sleep more than seven hours a day.  Sleep increases your levels of growth hormone, a critical vitality booster.




You Sweat... We Pay!™

KardioFit, Inc. Changes Name to KrowdFit, Partners with Jawbone® and Announces First Ever Socially Powered, Crowdfunded Wellness Rewards Program.



Share Article






















KrowdFit has awarded nearly $500,000 in cash rewards and demonstrated industry-leading engagement rates of 70% plus over a 24-month period.







KrowdFit

"Thanks KrowdFit! Not only did I just win $10,000 in KrowdFit, but I have lost 32.8 pounds in 3.5 months. I have 40 more pounds to goal and with that I will have lost 270 pounds all through diet and exercise with KrowdFit." - Trebor Yocum, KrowdFit member


Past News ReleasesRSS



Bend, Oregon (PRWEB)
February 03, 2015
 KardioFit, Inc., the leader in milestone driven cash rewards programs, today announced it will officially do business as KrowdFit. This change is reflective of an expanded vision, a broader commitment to health promotion, and accelerated business growth. KrowdFit is the first crowdfunded consumer and employee wellness rewards program that leverages the crowd (a.k.a. KROWD) to fund and promote a patent-pending, wellness program. The program is designed to reward the effort individuals make to live a healthy, active lifestyle.  KrowdFit is member-driven and provides individuals with the ability to earn unlimited cash rewards, ranging from $125 a week to $5,000 per quarter, for engaging and sustaining a healthy, active lifestyle. .
KrowdFit members can also now track their activity using Jawbone’s latest UP biometric wearable products.  Through its partnership with Jawbone, KrowdFit offers members wearable device bundles for the UPMove, UP24 and UP3 and includes a 12-month membership in its wellness rewards program. Existing Jawbone UP users can join KrowdFit and will be eligible to win $125 per week, $250 per month, $2,500 per quarter and/or $5,000 per quarter for tracking their meals, sleep, steps, and physical activity.
“Let’s face it, the obesity epidemic in the United States, in many respects, is a social problem. Collectively, we have the ability to create a healthy revolution!” said KrowdFit Founder and CEO Jim Miller.  “If you're already fit then KrowdFit is a bonus for you!  You can join the KROWD and be rewarded for the healthy, active, lifestyle you already live.  The cash rewards you win can be used to buy that new race bike, running shoes, or exercise equipment.  If you're just getting off the couch, KrowdFit is an approachable program that rewards the effort you make to get in shape. It helps you get over the hump to begin living a healthy, active lifestyle.”
KrowdFit was designed so that each person’s effort is rewarded equally with entries into cash giveaways where winners are randomly selected.  There is no limit to how many times a member can win KrowdFit rewards, members simply cannot win the same reward in back-to-back periods.  KrowdFit is currently paying out more than $30,000 per quarter in cash rewards to its members for engaging in healthy activities.  As the KROWD grows, KrowdFit will continue to increase the rewards pool $10,000 per month for each new 5,000 members that join.  KrowdFit also offers a $1 Million Fitness Sweepstakes with drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to complement ongoing weekly, monthly, and quarterly wellness cash giveaways.
“KrowdFit has driven sustained engagement in excess of 70% over a 24 month period, with 97% of members uploading their biometric data at least weekly,” observed Dr. David Katz, founding director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center and KrowdFit advisor. “I am not aware of many wellness and prevention programs that are driving this level of engagement or that offer this type of opportunity to impact outcomes at the individual level.”
