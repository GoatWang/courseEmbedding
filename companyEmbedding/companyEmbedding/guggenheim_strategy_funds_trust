Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares of the CurrencyShares Trusts are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. Performance results are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Prices shown are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise noted. 



The Current Interest Rate accrues daily and pays out monthly for the respective currency's interest bearing account. The Current Interest Rate, set by the Depository, can fluctuate as frequently as daily to reflect the local overnight rate, market conditions and the Depository's liquidity needs. The 40 bps management fee charged by the sponsor will be paid out of interest earned and has not been accounted for in the Current Interest Rate stated above.
Interest earned by the trust, if any, will accrue daily and will be used to pay trust expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to shareholders monthly. There is no assurance any interest will be paid, and if paid, may not be the best available.   If the trust’s expenses exceed interest earned, the trustee will withdraw the respective currency from the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the amount of the currency represented by each share on an ongoing basis and may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.
 

Each of the CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar (FXA) Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling (FXB) Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar (FXC) Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi (FXCH) Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro (FXE) Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen (FXY) Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar (FXSG) Trust, CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona (FXS) Trust and CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc (FXF) Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, you may click the links above or the Trust will arrange to send you its prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 800.820.0888.

The CurrencyShares Trusts are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and shareholders do not have the same regulatory protections afforded to investors in registered investment companies.

The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust.  This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency.  Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust.  Factors that may have the effect  of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national  debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, investment and trading activities  of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust are also subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. 

This website is directed to and intended for use by citizens or residents of the United States of America only. The material provided on this website is not intended as a recommendation or as investment advice of any kind, including in connection with rollovers, transfers, and distributions. Such material is not provided in a fiduciary capacity, may not be relied upon for or in connection with the making of investment decisions, and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell securities. All content has been provided for informational or educational purposes only and is not intended to be and should not be construed as legal or tax advice and/or a legal opinion. Always consult a financial, tax and/or legal professional regarding your specific situation. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

The information on this web site is for informational purposes only and is not, and is not intended to be, a complete discussion of all material information you should know about the CurrencyShares Trusts. 


CurrencyShares® are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. 


Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust can be bought and sold through a broker; as such, investors may be required to pay brokerage commissions in connection with a purchase or sale. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares of any CurrencyShares Trust will develop or be maintained. The risks associated with each of the CurrencyShares Trusts are not identical because of differences in the economies underlying each CurrencyShares Trust, as well as other considerations. For a more complete discussion of risk factors applicable to each CurrencyShares Trust, carefully read the particular Trust's prospectus.
      
        Interest earned on the deposited currency, if any, will be used to pay the Trust's expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to Shareholders monthly. Such interest is not expected to form a significant part of the Shareholders' investment return. If the Trust's expenses exceed interest earned, the Trustee will withdraw respective currency held by the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the number of currency per Share. This may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.  

        The NAV and Market Close performance may differ. A major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the NAV, which is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate and Market Close, which is calculated using Closing Price (last trade). WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time.   

        NAV is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate. WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time. Prior to 11/13/2008, NAVs for each CurrencyShares Trust, except the CurrencyShares Russian Ruble Trust and the CurrencyShares Chinese Renminbi Trusts, were calculated using the Noon Buying Rate, as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For more information, please read the prospectus.  

      The WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates are provided by WM/Reuters and are used for certain currencies (the “Rates”) displayed herein. WM/Reuters shall not be liable for any errors in or delays in providing or making available the WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates, nor for any actions taken in reliance on the same. This information cannot be used, reproduced, distributed, redistributed, licensed or disclosed in any way without a written agreement with WM/Reuters. 

      Spot Prices provided by FactSet. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the Internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades.

Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 91 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to achieve absolute returns.




Strategy



The advisor intends to invest in multiple proprietary and third-party investment strategies that seek to identify and profit from upcoming movements in any combination of global fixed income, currency, commodity, or equity markets. It will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in "managed futures." It also may invest up to 25% of its assets in municipal securities. The fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in a wholly-owned and controlled Cayman Islands subsidiary as measured at the end of every quarter of its taxable year. It is non-diversified.


Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in options. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 05/03/2010.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 03/02/2007, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in options. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/3/2010.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 3/2/2007, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/3/2010.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 3/2/2007, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Since Inception returns assume a purchase of common shares at each Fund’s initial offering price for market price returns or the Fund’s initial net asset value (NAV) for NAV returns. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized. All distributions are assumed to be reinvested either in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for market price returns or NAV for NAV returns. Until the DRIP price is available from the Plan Agent, the market price returns reflect the reinvestment at the closing market price on the last business day of the month. Once the DRIP is available around mid-month, the market price returns are updated to reflect reinvestment at the DRIP price. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Please refer to the most recent annual or semi-annual report for additional information.
Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.
1 Latest declared distribution per share annualized and divided by the current share price.
2 Distributions may be paid from sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains or return of capital. If a distribution consists of something other than ordinary income, a 19(a) notice detailing the anticipated source(s) of the distribution will be made available. The 19(a) notice will be posted to the Fund’s website and to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation so that brokers can distribute such notices to Shareholders of the Fund. Section 19(a) notices are provided for informational purposes only and not for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in a particular year will be made after the end of the year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.
3 Represents the amount of financial leverage the Fund currently employs as a percentage of total Fund assets.
4 Expense ratios are annualized and reflect the funds operating expense, excluding interest expense, or in the case of a fund with a fee waiver, net operating expense, as of the most recent annual or semi-annual report. The expense ratio, based on common assets, including interest expense was 2.01%.



Investment Objective
The Fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of current income and gains with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities. GPIM will manage the Fund utilizing a covered call strategy developed by GPIM to seek to utilize efficiencies from the tax characteristics of the Fund's portfolio. GPIM's covered call strategy will seek to follow a dynamic rules-based methodology to obtain broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets, either through investments that replicate the economic characteristics of broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets, including exchange-traded funds or other investment funds that track equity market indices, or through investments in individual common stocks along with other securities and instruments. The Fund will have the ability to write call options on indices and/or securities which will typically be at- or out-of-the money. GPIM's strategy typically targets one-month options, although options of any strike price or maturity may be utilized.
The Fund will seek to earn income and gains through both dividends paid by on securities owned by the Fund and cash premiums received from selling options. Although the Fund will receive premiums from the options written, by writing a covered call option, the Fund forgoes any potential increase in value of the underlying securities above the strike price specified in an option contract through the expiration date of the option. To the extent GPIM's strategy seeks to achieve broad equity exposure through a portfolio of common stocks, the Fund would hold a diversified portfolio of stocks, whereas to the extent GPIM's equity exposure strategy is implemented through investment in broad-based equity exchange-traded funds and other investment funds or instruments, the Fund's portfolio may comprise fewer holdings.

Frequently Asked Questions
GPM, GGE, GEQ Fund Merger

Prior to market open on March 20th, 2017, the assets of Guggenheim Enhanced Equity Strategy Fund (GGE) and Guggenheim Equal Weight Enhanced Equity Income Fund (GEQ) were merged into the Guggenheim Enhanced Equity Income Fund (GPM). For details, please see the press release.

What effect will the mergers have on the distributions for shareholders of GGE, GEQ and GPM?

Historically, GGE, GEQ and GPM have declared and paid quarterly distributions on different schedules. After the completion of the mergers, GPM is expected to continue to declare and pay its quarterly dividend each March, June, September and December, until modified by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.
The mergers of GGE and GEQ into GPM were completed on March 20, 2017, after the ex-dividend and record dates of GPM’s first quarterly 2017 distribution (March 13 and March 15, respectively). Prior to the mergers, GEQ paid its first quarter distribution in January and GGE paid its first quarter distribution in February.
The overall effect of the mergers is that shareholders of GGE, GEQ and GPM, respectively, are expected to receive a total of four quarterly distributions in 2017, if they were shareholders of record throughout the year. Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change at the discretion of the Fund’s Board of Trustees.

Describe the differences between closed-end and open-end funds?

An open-end fund may be purchased or sold at NAV. An open-end fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares. When selling an open-end fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the NAV is calculated. Unlike the open-end fund, a closed-end fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand. An investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open. The common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the NAV.

What does the "Ex-Div" or the "Ex-Dividend" date refer to?

Every quarter the Fund pays dividends and those investors who purchase the Fund before the ex-dividend date will receive the next dividend distribution. Investors who purchase on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive the next dividend distribution. The value of the dividend is subtracted from the Fund's NAV on the ex-dividend date each quarter. So when the NAV is reported with an "ex-div" behind it, this means that the amount of the dividend has already been taken out of the NAV.

What is the DRIP and how does it work?

DRIP is the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The number of shares of Common Stock distributed to participants in the Plan in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. Whenever the market price per share of the Fund’s Common Stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share on the valuation date, participants in the Plan will be issued new shares valued at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the then-current market value. Otherwise, the Administrator will buy shares of the Common Stock in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere.

Risks
There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Risk is inherent in all investing, including the loss of your entire principal. Therefore, before investing you should consider the following risks carefully.
Equity Securities and Related Market Risk
The market price of common stocks and other equity securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities may decline in value due to factors affecting equity securities markets generally, particular industries represented in those markets or the issuer itself. The values of equity securities may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. They may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry. The value of equity securities may also decline for a number of other reasons which directly relate to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage, the issuer’s historical and prospective earnings, the value of its assets and reduced demand for its goods and services. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than bonds and other debt securities.
Other Investment Companies Risk
The Fund may invest in securities of other open-or closed-end investment companies, including ETFs. As a stockholder in an investment company, the Fund will bear its ratable share of that investment company’s expenses, and would remain subject to payment of the Fund’s investment management fees with respect to the assets so invested. Shareholders would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the Fund invests in other investment companies. In addition, these other investment companies may utilize financial leverage, in which case an investment would subject the Fund to additional risks associated with leverage.
Options Risk
There are various risks associated with the Fund’s covered call option strategy. The purchaser of an index option written by the Fund has the right to any appreciation in the cash value of the index over the strike price on the expiration date. Therefore, as the writer of an index call option, the Fund forgoes the opportunity to profit from increases in the index over the strike price of the option. However, the Fund has retained the risk of loss (net of premiums received) should the price of the Fund’s portfolio securities decline. Similarly, as the writer of a call option on an individual security held in the Fund’s portfolio, the Fund forgoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss (net of premiums received) should the price of the underlying security decline.
The value of options written by the Fund, which will be priced daily, will be affected by, among other factors, changes in the value of underlying securities (including those comprising an index), changes in the dividend rates of underlying securities, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and underlying securities and the remaining time to an option’s expiration. The value of an option also may be adversely affected if the market for the option is reduced or becomes less liquid.
There are significant differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well conceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. In the case of index options, GPIM will attempt to maintain for the Fund written call options positions on equity indexes whose price movements, taken in the aggregate, are closely correlated with the price movements of common stocks and other securities held in the Fund’s equity portfolio. However, this strategy involves significant risk that the changes in value of the indexes underlying the Fund’s written call options positions will not correlate closely with changes in the market value of securities held by the Fund. To the extent that there is a lack of correlation, movements in the indexes underlying the options positions may result in losses to the Fund, which may more than offset any gains received by the Fund from options premiums. In these and other circumstances, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities to satisfy its obligations as the writer of an index call option, when it would not otherwise choose to do so, or may choose to sell portfolio securities to realize gains to supplement Fund distributions. Such sales would involve transaction costs borne by the Fund and may also result in realization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and may adversely impact the Fund’s after-tax returns.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the Fund seeks to close out an option position. Reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following: (i) there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options; (ii) restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both; (iii) trading halts, suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options; (iv) unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange; (v) the facilities of an exchange or The Options Clearing Corporation (the “OCC”) may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume; or (vi) one or more exchanges could, for economic or other reasons, decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options (or a particular class or series of options). If trading were discontinued, the secondary market on that exchange (or in that class or series of options) would cease to exist. However, outstanding options on that exchange that had been issued by the OCC as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms. In the event that the Fund were unable to close out a call option that it had written on a portfolio security, it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise. To the extent that the Fund owns unlisted (or “over-the-counter”) options, the Fund’s ability to terminate these options may be more limited than with exchange-traded options and may involve enhanced risk that counterparties participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations.
The hours of trading for options may not conform to the hours during which the securities held by the Fund are traded. To the extent that the options markets close before the markets for the underlying securities, significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the options markets. Additionally, the exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the option’s expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate events affecting underlying securities, such as extraordinary dividends, stock splits, mergers or other extraordinary distributions or events. A reduction in the exercise price of an option might reduce the Fund’s capital appreciation potential on underlying securities held by the Fund.
The Fund’s use of purchased put options on equity indexes as a hedging strategy would involve certain risks similar to those of written call options, including that the strategy may not work as intended due to a lack of correlation between changes in value of the index underlying the put option and changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Further, a put option acquired by the Fund and not sold prior to expiration will expire worthless if the cash value of the index or market value of the underlying security at expiration exceeds the exercise price of the option, thereby causing the Fund to lose its entire investment in the option.
The Fund’s options transactions will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges, boards of trade or other trading facilities on which the options are traded. These limitations govern the maximum number of options in each class which may be written or purchased by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert, regardless of whether the options are written or purchased on the same or different exchanges, boards of trade or other trading facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers. Thus, the number of options which the Fund may write or purchase may be affected by options written or purchased by other investment advisory clients of GPIM. An exchange, board of trade or other trading facility may order the liquidation of positions found to be in excess of these limits, and it may impose other sanctions.
Other Derivatives Risk
Derivatives are subject to a number of risks such as liquidity risk, equity securities risk, issuer risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, leveraging risk, counterparty risk, management risk and, if applicable, medium and smaller company risk. They also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation, the risk of ambiguous documentation and the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with an underlying asset, interest rate or index. Suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the Fund will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial. The use of derivatives transactions may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment or may cause the Fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. Additionally, amounts paid by the Fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivatives  transactions are not otherwise available to the Fund for investment purposes.
The Fund may enter into derivatives transactions that may in certain circumstances produce effects similar to leverage and expose the Fund to related risks. See “Leverage Risk” below.
Counterparty Risk
The Fund will be subject to risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts purchased or sold by the Fund. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in these circumstances.
Medium and Smaller Company Risk
The general risks associated with the types of securities in which the Fund invests are particularly pronounced for securities issued by companies with medium and smaller market capitalizations. These companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources or they may depend on a few key employees. As a result, they may be subject to greater levels of credit, market and issuer risk. Securities of medium and smaller companies may trade less frequently and in lesser volume than more widely held securities and their values may fluctuate more sharply than other securities.
Financial Leverage Risk
Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and capital appreciation but, at the same time, creates special risks. There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be utilized or will be successful. Financial leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the Fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not implemented. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund’s portfolio will be magnified when the Fund uses financial leverage. As a result, financial leverage may cause greater changes in the Fund’s net asset value and returns than if financial leverage had not been used. The Fund will also have to pay interest on its indebtedness, if any, which may reduce the Fund’s return. This interest expense may be greater than the Fund’s return on the underlying investment, which would negatively affect the performance of the Fund.
During the time in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the amount of the fees paid to the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser for investment advisory services will be higher than if the Fund did not utilize financial leverage because the fees paid will be calculated based on the Fund’s Managed Assets, including proceeds of financial leverage. This may create a conflict of interest between the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser and common shareholders. Common shareholders bear the portion of the investment advisory fee attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of financial leverage, which means that common shareholders effectively bear the entire advisory fee. In order to manage this conflict of interest, any use of financial leverage must be approved by the Board of Trustees and the Board of Trustees will receive regular reports from the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser regarding the Fund’s use of financial leverage and the effect of financial leverage on the management of the Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund.
Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risks that the interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds will be less than the interest expense and Fund expenses, that the market value of the securities sold by the Fund may decline below the price at which the Fund is obligated to repurchase such securities and that the securities may not be returned to the Fund.
Foreign Investment Risk
The Fund’s investments in ADRs and other securities of foreign issuers involve special risks. For example, the value of these investments may decline in response to unfavorable political and legal developments, unreliable or untimely information, or economic and financial instability. There may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than a U.S. company. Foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial standards and requirements comparable to those standards applicable to U.S. companies. Similar foreign investment risks may apply to futures contracts and other derivative instruments in which the Fund invests that trade on foreign exchanges. The value of derivative and other instruments denominated in or that pay revenues in foreign currencies may fluctuate based on changes in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and a decline in applicable foreign exchange rates could reduce the value of such instruments held by the Fund. Foreign settlement procedures also may involve additional risks.
Inflation/Deflation Risk
Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from the Fund’s investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates. As inflation increases, the real value of the Fund’s portfolio could decline. Deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time. Deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely, which may result in a decline in the value of the Fund’s portfolio.
Management Risk
The Fund is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio. The Sub-Adviser will apply investment techniques and risk analysis in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results. The Fund will invest in securities that the Sub-Adviser believes are undervalued or mispriced as a result of recent economic events, such as market dislocations, the inability of other investors to evaluate risk and forced selling. If the Sub-Adviser’s perception of the value of a security is incorrect, your investment in the Fund may lose value.
Portfolio Turnover Risk
The Fund’s annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year. Portfolio turnover rate is not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the Fund. A higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the Fund. High portfolio turnover may result in an increased realization of net short-term capital gains by the Fund which, when distributed to shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. Additionally, in a declining market, portfolio turnover may create realized capital losses.
Recent Market Developments
During the financial crisis of 2007-08, global financial markets have experienced periods of severe turmoil. The debt and equity capital markets in the United States were negatively impacted by significant write-offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re-pricing of credit risk in the broader market, among other things. These events, along with the deterioration of the housing market, the failure of major financial institutions and the resulting United States federal government actions led to worsening general economic conditions, which materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular. Volatile financial markets can expose the Fund to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing portfolio instruments held by the Fund. Recently markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations for an economic recovery increased. However, risks to a robust resumption of growth persist. A U.S. or global economic downturn could adversely impact the Fund’s portfolio. Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices, among other factors. Moreover, Federal Reserve policy, including with respect to certain interest rates and the decision to end its quantitative easing policy, may adversely affect the value, volatility and liquidity of dividend- and interest-paying securities. Market volatility, rising interest rates and/or a return to unfavorable economic conditions could impair the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective.
Legislation Risk
At any time after the date of this prospectus, legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the companies in which the Fund invests. Changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact companies in which the Fund invests. In addition, legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the Fund itself is regulated. There can be no assurance that future legislation, regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund or will not impair the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objectives.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law in July 2010, has resulted in a significant revision of the U.S. financial regulatory framework. The Dodd-Frank Act covers a broad range of topics, including, among many others: a reorganization of federal financial regulators; the creation of a process designed to ensure financial system stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms; the enactment of new rules for derivatives trading; the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog; the registration and regulation of managers of private funds; the regulation of rating agencies; and the enactment of new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans.
Title VII (the “Derivatives Title”) of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a new regulatory structure on derivatives markets, with particular emphasis on swaps and security-based swaps (collectively “swaps”). The Adviser and/or the Fund may incur additional legal and compliance costs and transaction fees in connection with the trading of such swaps. Regulatory changes imposed as a result of the implementation of the Derivatives Title may jeopardize certain trades and/or trading strategies that may be employed by the Adviser, or at least make them more costly. There may be market dislocations due to uncertainty during the implementation period of any new regulation and the Adviser cannot know how the derivatives market will adjust to new regulations.
On December 11, 2015, the SEC published a proposed rule that, if adopted, would change the regulation of the use of derivative instruments and financial commitment transactions by registered investment companies. The SEC sought public comments on numerous aspects of the proposed rule, and as a result the nature of any final regulations is uncertain at this time. Such regulations could limit the implementation of the Fund’s use of derivatives and impose additional compliance costs on the Fund, which could have an adverse impact on the Fund.
Market Disruption and Geopolitical Risk
The aftermath of the war in Iraq and the continuing occupation of Iraq, instability in the Middle East and terrorist attacks in the United States and around the world have contributed to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. The Adviser and Sub-Adviser do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the U.S. and global economies and securities markets.
Anti-Takeover Provisions Risk
The Fund’s Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”) and the Fund’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (collectively, the “Governing Documents”) include provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or convert the Fund to an open-end fund. These provisions could have the effect of depriving the Common Shareholders of opportunities to sell their Common Shares at a premium over the then-current market price of the Common Shares.
Market Discount Risk
Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value, which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities. Although the value of the Fund’s net assets is generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell Common Shares, whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of Common Shares will depend entirely upon whether the market price of Common Shares at the time of sale is above or below the investor’s purchase price for Common Shares. Because the market price of Common Shares will be determined by factors such as net asset value, dividend and distribution levels (which are dependent, in part, on expenses), supply of and demand for Common Shares, stability of dividends or distributions, trading volume of Common Shares, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Fund, the Fund cannot predict whether Common Shares will trade at, below or above net asset value or at, below or above the initial public offering price. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their Common Shares soon after the completion of the public offering, as the net asset value of the Common Shares will be reduced immediately following the offering as a result of the payment of certain offering costs. Common Shares of the Fund are designed primarily for long-term investors; investors in Common Shares should not view the Fund as a vehicle for trading purposes.
