Leawood-based Montage Investments grew its assets under management by 53.9 percent in 2013, reaching $20 billion.
Montage Investments is the asset management arm of Mariner Holdings LLC, which also has a wealth advisory arm called Mariner Wealth Management. Mariner Holdings CEO Marty Bicknell founded both arms.




 


The growth at Montage was driven mainly by increased demand from advisers and their clients for new and innovative products.




Montage launched six mutual funds in 2013: Tortoise North American Energy Independence Fund on April 1; Tortoise Select Opportunity Fund on Sept. 30; Palmer Square’s Fountain Short Duration High Income Fund on Oct. 7; Convergence Opportunities Fund on Nov. 29; Consilium Emerging Market Small Cap Fund on Dec. 30; and Nuance Mid Cap Value Fund on Dec. 31.
“We’ve put strategies in the marketplace that are unique and run by boutique managers,” said Gary Henson, president and CIO of Montage Investments. “So the manager has a significant stake in his or her entity and remains very engaged.”
Henson said the model allows a manager to remain hyper-focused on investing assets, rather than worrying about building business, hiring and firing, IT and things like that.
Then Montage taps the expertise of the boutique managers to create new types of investments that clients are asking about.
“It ends up being a huge win for everyone,” Henson said. “In the end, we get an adviser-driven, demand-based product that is unique in the marketplace and has few competitors.”

James reports about banking, financial services and law.
