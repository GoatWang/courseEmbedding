(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Some of the statements contained in this Annual Report that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" which can be identified by the use of terminology such as "estimates," "projects," "plans," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," or the negative or other variations, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We urge you to be cautious of the forward-looking statements, that such statements, which are contained in this Annual Report, reflect our current beliefs with respect to future events and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors affecting our operations, market growth, services, products and licenses.  No assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future results, as actual results may differ materially as a result of the risks we face, and actual events may differ from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made regarding anticipated events. Factors that may cause actual results, our performance or achievements, or industry results, to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include without limitation:  � our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms and conditions;  All written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Given the uncertainties that surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.  Overview  Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. (the "Company" formerly known as Superior Silver Mines, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Idaho on January 22, 1962 as Superior Mines Company and then changed its name to Superior Silver Mines, Inc. The Company reincorporated as a Nevada corporation on December 27, 2010. The Company has been dormant for a number of years, and has no known mineral reserves.  On December 29, 2010, Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company" or "Solar Wind"), completed a reverse merger (the "Merger") with Solar Wind Energy, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 26, 2010 ("Solar Wind - Subsidiary"). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued to the stockholders of Solar Wind - Subsidiary in exchange for their Solar Wind - Subsidiary Common Stock, the right to receive an aggregate of 300,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. As a result of the reverse merger, Solar Wind - Subsidiary is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  For accounting purposes, Solar Wind - Subsidiary was the surviving entity. The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of Solar Wind - Subsidiary pursuant to which Solar Wind - Subsidiary was treated as the surviving and continuing entity although the Company is the legal acquirer rather than a reverse acquisition. Accordingly, the Company's historical financial statements are those of Solar Wind - Subsidiary immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger. Also, going forward the business operations of Solar Wind - Subsidiary will become the Company's principal business operations.  The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on January 22, 1962, as Superior Mines Company. In 1964, the Company's name was changed to Superior Silver Mines, Inc. On December 27, 2010, the Company reincorporated as a Nevada corporation. Prior to the Merger, the Company had been dormant for a number of years and had no known mineral reserves. On January 21, 2011, the Company changed its name from Superior Silver Mines, Inc. to Clean Wind Energy Tower, Inc. On March 11, 2013, the Company changed its name to Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. On the same day, Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, Clean Wind Energy, Inc. changed its name to Solar Wind Energy, Inc. In addition, effective January 24, 2011, the Company's quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from SSVM.OB to CWET.OB and on March 11, 2013, in conjunction with our name change, the Company's quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from CWET.OB to SWET.OB.  The Company plans to design, develop, and construct large downdraft towers that use benevolent, non-toxic natural elements to generate electricity and clean water economically ("Downdraft Towers") by integrating and synthesizing numerous proven as well as emerging technologies. In addition to constructing Downdraft Towers in the United States and abroad, the Company intends to be prepared to establish partnerships at home and abroad to propagate these systems and meet increasing global demand for clean water and electricity.  On January 21, 2011, the Company changed its name to Clean Wind Energy Tower, Inc. and on March 11, 2013, changed its name to Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. along with its wholly owned subsidiary, a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, which changed its name from Clean Wind Energy, Inc. to Solar Wind Energy, Inc. In addition, effective January 24, 2011, the Company's quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from "SSVM" to" CWET" and in conjunction with the March 11, 2013 name change the Company's quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from "CWET" to "SWET."  Until the consummation of the Merger, the Company's purpose was to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warranted, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to it by persons or firms who, or which, desire to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly registered corporation. Because the Company had no operations and only nominal assets until the Merger, it was considered a shell company under rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Plan of Operation  Our Company's core objective and focus is to become a leading provider of clean efficient green energy to the world communities at a reasonable cost without the destructive residuals of fossil fuel, while continuing to generate innovative technological solutions for today and tomorrow's electrical power needs.  As a development stage company, Solar Wind has yet to earn revenues from its operations. Solar Wind is developing plans to design and construct large Downdraft Towers that use benevolent, non-toxic natural elements to generate electricity and clean water economically by integrating and synthesizing numerous proven as well as emerging technologies. In addition to constructing Downdraft Towers in the United States and abroad, the Company intends to be prepared to establish partnerships at home and abroad to propagate these systems and meet increasing global demand for clean water and electricity. From our inception in July 2010, we have completed the following milestones, among others  � The Company has filed numerous patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property. The Company has been awarded four patents. Patent #8120191 issued 2/21/2012 "Efficient Energy Conversion Devices & Methods" The patent covers a novel hydraulic system capable of maintaining high efficiency hydraulic to electric conversion under a wide variance of wind speeds, as coupled to a plurality of wind turbines in wind tunnels. Patent #8,517,662B2 issued 8/27/2013 "Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods" The patent covers a structure for producing electricity, specifically a Tower capable of adding moisture at the top of the structure to hot-dry air so as to generate a downdraft of wind within the interior of the Tower, vanes coupled to the exterior of the Tower that at least partially define a plurality of elongated pockets to the exterior of the Tower, and flaps located to redirect the incident wind downwards into tunnels to convert wind to electricity. Patent # 8,643,204 B2 issued 2/4/2014 "Efficient Energy Conversion Devices and Methods" This application enhances and broadens previously issued Patent #8120191 Patent #8,727,698 B1 issued 5/20/2014 "Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods" The patent claims are targeted to represent the advantages of the new Tower structural shape, the configuration of the Tower walls, their composition as well as the wall thicknesses for a given height, along with more efficient construction methodology and enhanced wind force resistance over prior Tower designs.  � Executed agreements with three strategic world class companies with industry experience to assist in developing our Downdraft Tower.  � Identified and executed agreements with key industry consultants.  � The Company completed a comprehensive meteorological assessment and selected an area located in San Luis, Arizona to pursue the construction of their innovative green renewable energy Downdraft Tower Facility.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.  General  The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue, if any, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Basic and diluted net loss per share  We utilize ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" for calculating the basic and diluted loss per share. In accordance with ASC 260, the basic and diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic net loss per share except that the denominator is adjusted for the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants, and other convertible securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Potentially dilutive securities were not included in the calculation of the diluted net loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  Income taxes  The Company utilizes ASC 740 "Income Taxes" which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Temporary difference between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expenses. The adoption of ASC 740 "Income Taxes"did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  Revenue Recognition  The Company has generated no revenues to date. It is the Company's policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. The Company has not yet generated any revenue as of to date.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company adopted the provisions under FASB for Fair Value Measurements, which define fair value for accounting purposes, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements. The Company's adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Fair value is defined as an exit price, which is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial assets and liabilities with readily available, actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and require less judgment in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial assets and liabilities that are rarely traded or not quoted have less price observability and are generally measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency of the asset, liability or market and the nature of the asset or liability. The Company has categorized its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy in accordance with these provisions.  In January 2010 the FASB issued Update No. 2010-05 "Compensation-Stock Compensation-Escrowed Share Arrangements and Presumption of Compensation" ("2010-05"). 2010-05 re-asserts that the Staff of the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC Staff") has stated the presumption that for certain shareholders escrowed share represent a compensatory arrangement. 2010-05 further clarifies the criteria required to be met to establish a position different from the SEC Staff's position. The Company does not believe this pronouncement to have any material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Accounting for Derivatives  In 2014 and 2015, we issued convertible notes payable that contained certain conversion features which we identified as embedded derivatives. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 815-40, we reclassified the fair value of the conversion feature from equity to a liability at the date of issuance. Subsequent to the initial issuance date, we are required to adjust to fair value the derivative as an adjustment to current period operations.  New Accounting Pronouncements  There are various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  Revenue  The Company has not generated revenue since inception.  Operating Expenses  Research and Development  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $113,653 of research and development expenses as compared to $156,251 for the year ended December 31, 2014; a decrease of $42,598, or 27%. The Company anticipates continued research and development as products are developed dependent on funding availability.  Selling and Administrative  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $1,056,712 of selling and administrative expenses as compared to $1,870,266 for the year ended December 31, 2014; a decrease of $813,554, or 43.5%. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction of the Company's stock based compensation from $642,053 to $9,433 from 2014 to 2015.  Depreciation  Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $708 as compared to $2,520 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduced deprecation is due to aging of our office equipment.  Other Income/Expense  Interest expense  For year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $2,363,544 as interest expense relating to our issued notes payable as compared to $4,212,671 for the same period last year. In connection with the issuances, we incurred noncash charge to interest of $752,003 during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the excess of fair value of the conversion feature over the note proceeds compared to $2,272,821 for the prior year. In addition, we amortized a debt discount associated with the notes of $1,310,773 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1,646,605 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  (Loss) gain on settlement of debt  In 2015, we accrued an outstanding 2016 litigation settlement due to Typenex for $90,000, subsequently paid in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we settled an outstanding debt obligation for less than our carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $32,985 gain on settlement of debt during the 2014 year as compared with none in the current year.  (Loss) gain from change in fair value of derivative liabilities  Each reporting period, we are required to adjust to fair value the conversion features of our convertible notes. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reported a (loss) gain from change in fair value of ($1,506,927) and $1,089,103, respectively.  Net Loss  As a result of the activities described above, we incurred a net loss of $5,127,108 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a net loss of $5,117,818 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have financed our operations since inception primarily through private offerings of our equity securities and debt financing.  Working Capital  Our working capital deficit increased by ($2,735,810) during the year ended December 31, 2015 from a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $3,213,779 at December 31, 2014 to a working capital deficit of $5,949,589 at December 31, 2015. The increase in working capital deficit for the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to a combination of reasons, of which the significant factors include:  � Cash had a net decrease from working capital by $77,545 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The most significant uses and proceeds of cash were:  � Approximately $987,000 of cash consumed in operating activities;  � Proceeds of $50,000 from sale of an interest in our Arizona Green Power LLC majority owned subsidiary  � Proceeds of $934,000 from issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes  Of the total current assets of $11,219 as of December 31, 2015, represented by cash. Of the total current assets of $88,764 as of December 31, 2014, represented by cash.  Proceeds from the sale of an interest in our Arizona Green Power LLC subsidiary  On November 17, 2015, we entered into a Fourth Amended Option Agreement (the "Amended Option Agreement") to the option agreement dated April 11, 2014 with several investors and current land owners. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Option Agreement, the land owners agreed to invest $600,000 and defer until closing an additional $450,000 due on the option payment in exchange for a 2.67% equity investment in AGP, Company's majority owned subsidiary.  Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the option agreement, the investor has also committed an additional $300,000 in exchange for a 1.33% equity investment, $50,000 which has been paid and the additional $250,000 conditioned upon the Company and AGP successfully procuring $5,000,000 or more in additional equity from investors, or such other additional amount as is necessary for the balance of the required pre-development and development costs to be completed.  Proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received net amount of $934,000 from the issuance of Convertible Promissory Notes after paying original interest discounts ("OID") and processing fees to the attorneys.  Cash flow analysis  Cash used in operations was $986,595 during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our primary capital needs were for operating expenses, including funds to support our business strategy, which primarily includes working capital necessary to fund operations and reducing our trade payables.  Cash used in investing activities as $74,950 comprised of payments for an option to acquire property.  Cash provided from financing activities was $984,000 comprised of sale in interest in our majority owned subsidiary of $50,000 and issuance of convertible notes payable of $934,000.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has reported a net loss of ($5,127,108) for the year ended December 31, 2015, accumulated deficit of ($19,111,294) and total current liabilities in excess of current assets of ($5,949,589) as of December 31, 2015.  The Company is in a pre-development and does not have any revenues from operations and will be dependent on funds raise to satisfy its ongoing capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Company will require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan and continue as a going concern. The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion or respond to competitive pressures, any of these circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.  Management expects that global economic conditions will continue to present a challenging operating environment through 2016. To the extent permitted by working capital resources, management intends to continue making targeted investments in strategic operating and growth initiatives. Working capital management will continue to be a high priority for 2016.  While we have been able to manage our working capital needs with the current credit facilities, additional financing is required in order to meet our current and projected cash flow requirements from operations. We cannot predict whether this new financing will be in the form of equity or debt. We may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. Additional investments are being sought, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such investments.  Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. However, the trading price of our common stock and the downturn in the U.S. stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations.  Our independent registered public accounting firm's report dated March 2, 2017 on our December 31, 2015 consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K states that our difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain operations raise substantial doubts about the our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Inflation  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Off-Balance sheet Arrangements  We do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements nor do we participate in any non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment other than the operating leases as disclosed in Item 2, Properties and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 13).

Overview









Patents









The Tower













First-To-Market Hybrid Solar-Wind Energy Technology
 
The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower is the first hybrid solar-wind renewable energy technology in the market. The patented structure is comprised of a tall hollow cylinder with a water injection system near the top and wind tunnels containing turbines near the bottom.
 
To start, a series of pumps deliver water to the Tower’s injection system at the top where a fine mist is cast across the entire opening. The water introduced by the injection system then evaporates and is absorbed by hot dry air which has been heated by the solar rays of the sun.  As a result, the air becomes cooler, denser and heavier than the outside warmer air, and falls through the cylinder at speeds up to and in excess of 50 mph. This air is then diverted into wind tunnels surrounding the base of the Tower where turbines inside the tunnels power generators to produce electricity.




In geographic areas where atmospheric conditions are conducive, the exterior of the Tower may be constructed with vertical “wind vanes” that capture the prevailing wind and channel it to produce supplemental electrical power. This dual renewable energy resource greatly enhances its clean energy-producing capability and productivity.
 
Solar Wind Energy’s Tower is unique in that it does not have any operational limitations in terms of time. It’s capable of operating around the clock, 24 hours per day, and seven days per week. Whereas there are operational limitations with solar collectors that work only when the sun shines, and with wind turbines that work only when the wind blows.
 
It also has the ability to be operated with virtually no carbon footprint, fuel consumption, or waste production. It generates clean, cost effective and efficient electrical power without damaging effects.













Proprietary Global Energy Generation Calculator
 
To complement its renewable energy technology and aid in its expansion efforts, Solar Wind Energy  developed a proprietary software based analytical program to determine the energy generation capabilities of its Towers based on the climate in geographic locations around the world, and has taken the appropriate steps to protect its intellectual property invention. This essential tool applies “known” scientific meteorology data of a specific area to the Tower’s variables in order to determine and project energy outputs on a daily basis. Advancements in the scientific community over the last decade make it possible to predict and pin-point specific weather conditions and have provided significant insights into the tool’s development process and direction.
 
Solar Wind Energy’s analytical tool, combined with its proprietary technology and existing core patents, provide it with a unique opportunity to plan and target the global positioning of its Towers to help meet the world’s energy needs. Solar Wind Energy can now rapidly respond to a request from virtually any country reasonably suitable to host a project and determine specifically where the Tower should be located, the size of it and the amount of electricity it can produce.









Abundant, Clean, Economical Energy Production
 
Through consistent innovation, the Company has successfully managed to economize the Tower, reducing capital costs while enhancing projected financial performance. This development was made possible by utilizing its Global Energy Generation Calculator software which can calculate and predict energy production of the Towers given a projected location and incorporating that locations’ local weather data. By feeding weather data of its future site location into the program, the Tower’s height and diameter can be adjusted along with the amount of water required as fuel to create a desired amount of energy. The outcome dictates the optimum size of each Tower.
 
Under the most recent design specifications, the Tower designed for a site near San Luis, Arizona, has a gross production capacity on an hourly basis, of up to 1,250 megawatt hours. Due to lower capacities during winter days, the average hourly output per day for sale to the grid for the entire year averages approximately 435 megawatt hours/hr.
 
Each Tower will be constructed on location using conventional materials, equipment and techniques, associated industries, as well as local workers in the surrounding town or city. Each location will benefit significantly from the creation of professional manufacturing, construction and transportation jobs, in addition to having a high efficiency energy resource close by – providing clean renewable energy at a cost more favorable than nuclear plants with no negative impacts to the environment.




















The Company has filed numerous patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property.  The Company has been awarded two patents, and currently has two other patent applications which have been designated with a “Notice of Allowance” and is awaiting issuance of the actual patent documents. The Company has judiciously pursued the patent applications that it feels are instrumental to the core development of its technology and project.









Patent  #8120191 Issued 2/21/2012   “Efficient Energy Conversion Devices & Methods”
 
This patent covers a novel hydraulic system capable of maintaining high efficiency hydraulic to electric conversion under a wide variance of wind speeds, as coupled to a plurality of wind turbines in wind tunnels.




Patent  #8,517,662 B2 Issued 8/27/2013 “Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods”
 
This patent covers a structure for producing electricity, specifically a Tower capable of adding moisture at the top of the structure to hot-dry air so as to generate a downdraft of wind within the interior of the Tower, vanes coupled to the exterior of the Tower that at least partially define a plurality of elongated pockets to the exterior of the Tower, and flaps located to redirect the incident wind downwards into tunnels to convert wind to electricity.




Patent  #8,643,204 B2 Issued 2/04/2014 “Efficient Energy Conversion Devices & Methods”
 
This patent enhances and broadens previously issued Patent #8120191




Patent  #8,727,698 B1 Issued 5/20/2014 “Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods”
 
This patent claims are targeted to represent the advantages of the new Tower structural shape, the configuration of the Tower walls, their composition as well as the wall thicknesses for a given height, along with more efficient construction methodology and enhanced wind force resistance over prior Tower designs.















The demonstration to the left depicts the Tower in operation. The color of the arrows represent the current internal temperature of the air which transitions from hot near the top of the Tower to cold as the air rapidly races towards its base. Please feel free to leave a comment or question on the Company’s YouTube channel after you watch this demonstration.

Solar Wind Energy | A bold new approach to overcome the current limitations of conventional wind energy sources



















Solar Wind Energy, Inc. offers a bold new approach to overcome the current limitations of conventional wind energy sources.

















Follow Us!
































Hear the latest
Solar Wind Energy Tower interview featured on American Scene National Radio.







Plus Other Calls and Interviews.


















 






Change is in the wind for the quiet border town of San Luis. The farming community might soon be home to a massive solar wind tower - the sheer enormity of which would make it a new Arizona landmark.
 
Read the whole story on CBS5AZ Here.
 
 
Interested in investing? Head over to the Investors page













Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. is the innovator and creator behind the only hybrid solar-wind technology in the market today. Formerly known as Clean Wind Energy Tower, Inc., the simplicity of Solar Wind Energy’s revolutionary solution lies in its ability to harness the natural power of a downdraft created when water is introduced to hot dry air within the confines of the Company’s patented tower structure.
 
Solar Wind Energy Inc., its commercializing subsidiary, is currently and actively pursuing strategic partnerships with various entities such as utilities, sovereign nations and independent power producers, to finance the project cost and share in the operational, financial and environmental benefits.
 
The time for exploration, innovation and development of alternative renewable energy resources is now. Various parties in the United States and other nations are aggressively pursuing clean energy solutions that use efficient and cost-effective renewable resources to serve society while avoiding the adverse effects associated with fossil and nuclear fuels.
 
Increasing emphasis on green technologies, growing investments in the industry by large banks, Fortune 500 companies and sophisticated investors such as Warren Buffett, as well as governmental incentives in the energy industry, make the global environment ripe for new innovation in alternative energy. This environment is expected to continue long-term as such, should have a positive effect on the Company’s business and the overall industry.
 










• Clean: Uses benevolent non-toxic natural elements to generate electricity
 
• Cost-Effective: Capable of eliciting significant energy-cost savings and carbon credits. Electricity produced is priced at 1/3 that of other alternative energy sources
 
• Consistent: Capable of operating and producing energy 24 hours/day, seven days/week
 
• Superior: Outperforms solar collectors that produce only when the sun is shining and wind turbines that produce only when the wind is blowing
 
• Sustainable: Able to be operated with virtually no carbon footprint, fuel consumption or waste production
 
• Green: Able to generate clean, cost effective and efficient electricity without the damaging effects caused by using fossil or nuclear fuels, and other known alternative power sources










Solar Wind Energy offers a bold new approach to the United States and other nations aggressively pursuing energy independence with clean, sustainable energy solutions – one that overcomes the current limitations of known alternative energy sources and can produce up to 1,250 megawatts.
 
The Company’s hybrid solar-wind downdraft tower technology combines dry air, heated by the solar rays of the sun, with H2O, which acts as a strong catalyst to create a powerful natural downdraft wind. This wind hits turbines within the tower at significant speeds – powering generators to produce massive amounts of electricity. Bold yet brilliant!





Click the "View demo" button to take a closer look at the Solar Wind Tower in action.

Solar Wind Energy Tower on KSAZ (FOX) 10







Solar Wind Energy Tower and CEO Ron Pickett make a visit to FOX 10 in Arizona to explain the benefits of constructing the Solar Wind Energy Tower in their home town.









Solar Wind Energy Tower on KECY (FOX)
- Yuma, AZ












Click "Watch Here" to watch the Stock News Now interview with SWET CEO Ron Pickett.








































Solar Wind Energy has assembled a world class team of experienced
business professionals, engineers, scientists and other key industry consultants …









The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower is a hollow cylinder reaching skyward into the hot dry atmosphere heated by the solar rays of the sun. Water injected near the opening at the top makes the dry air heavy causing it to sink towards the bottom of the Tower creating wind velocity which drives turbines.

Update on the giant Solar Wind Energy Tower
August 25, 2015 Paul Dvorak : 1 CommentThe Solar Wind Downdraft Tower (SWET) and structure is said to be capable of producing abundant, inexpensive electricity to meet the world’s increasing demand. The company recently issued an update on the execution of Company’s Business Plan and development of its Tower project in San Luis, Arizona.
The down-draft tower will, theoretically, generate moving dense air through wind turbines at the base.
The focus of the Company’s Business Plan has been to secure the proprietary and intellectual property necessary to enable development of its hybrid solar-wind clean energy solution,  the utility scale downdraft tower. SWET’s revenue model is based on charging developmental fees to potential developers of the towers and the receipt of long term recurring royalties defined by the amount of energy produced by the structures.
The company has assembled a team to pursue its business plan and achieve the necessary patents to facilitate the successful development.
Once the initial Tower is constructed, it will be a source of abundant, economically competitive clean power. Through its subsidiary Arizona Green Power, LLC (AGP), SWET has been pursuing and contributing significant resources, both manpower and capital, to development of its first tower project in San Luis, Arizona, called the AGP Tower Project.
The Business Model objective is for AGP to acquire necessary approvals for the project and identify an appropriate teaming partner to further develop the project, thereby ensuring that, in exchange for the rights to use the company’s intellectual property and proprietary know-how to develop other towers, SWET will receive the appropriate development and royalty fees.
“We believe sufficient accomplishments and entitlements are in hand to enable us to attract an entity to team with AGP and provide the necessary resources to pursue the development of the San Luis, AZ Tower Project,” says Ron Pickett, CEO of SWET. “Recently, we announced the engagement of Hanover International to vet the potential market and introduce SWET to the appropriate bankers, and to assist the company with defining its place in the market. Hanover diligently undertook the vetting process and introduced SWET to many interested potential firms. Our selection process is now complete.”
Through its banker, AGP is seeking sufficient capital to pay SWET the development fee and take the San Luis project to commencement of construction. Transferring development responsibilities to AGP will satisfy the capital requirements for SWET and eliminate the need for SWET to continue short term convertible note borrowings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
