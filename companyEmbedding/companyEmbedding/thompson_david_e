Thompson was founded by William Thompson in 1932 with a line of single vitamins. To ensure quality and purity, Thompson products were manufactured in house at the company's manufacturing facilities in Crenshaw, California. In keeping with Thompson's philosophy that supplements should be as clean, pure and as natural as possible, the Thompson brand was one of the first to abandon the use of coal tar and synthetic dyes that were standard in the industry in the early years.
The Thompson product line now includes around 200 products, from vitamins and minerals to herbs and specialty supplements. Herbspro.com is proud to carry the entire range of this fine brand.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Dr. David Thompson is on call.  First came the call of God to medical missions; then a phone call announced the brutal murder of David's parents at the hands of the Viet Cong. Later another call carried the determined missionary kid through medical school. Today, David Thompson responds to the persistent calls of the sick and dying at the Bongolo Mission Hospital in Gabon, West Africa.


Author Bio▼▲
DAVID THOMPSON was born in the U.S. but grew up in Cambodia where his parents worked for 16 years. When he was 14 he and his father tried unsuccessfully to save a Cambodian man who was seriously injured when a truck and a bus collided. God used the incident to plant in David's young heart a desire to become a doctor and help people who had limited access to healthcare. David graduated from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1973 with a M.D. degree and eventually completed five years of residency in general surgery in southern California. In 1977 he and his wife Rebecca moved to Gabon, Africa and for the next 34 years built a 150-bed full-service hospital to provide medical services to Gabon's least served provinces. In 1966, Dr. Thompson helped establish the Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS), an organization that trains African surgeons at Christian hospitals throughout the continent. Since 2014, Dr. Thompson has been working as a volunteer to train Egyptian surgeons at Harpur Memorial Hospital.
