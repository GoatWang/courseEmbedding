Item 29. Indemnification                                                        

The amended and restated By-Laws of the depositor provide that the depositor    
will indemnify, to the fullest extent now or hereafter provided for or permitted
by law, each person involved in, or made or threatened to be made a party to,   
any action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, including any 
investigative, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, and including  
any action by or in the right of the depositor or any other corporation, or any 
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise   
(any such entity, other than the depositor, being hereinafter referred to as an 
"Enterprise"), and including appeals therein (any such action or process being  
hereinafter referred to as a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such     
person, such person's testator or intestate (i) is or was a director or officer 
of the depositor, or (ii) is or was serving, at the request of the depositor, as
a director, officer, or in any other capacity, or any other Enterprise, against 
any and all judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and expenses, including      
attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred as a result of or in          
connection with any Proceeding, except as provided below.                       

No indemnification will be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment
or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that such        
person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and      
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated,  
or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other       
advantage to which such person was not legally entitled. In addition, no        
indemnification will be made with respect to any Proceeding initiated by any    
such person against the depositor, or a director or officer of the depositor,   
other than to enforce the terms of this indemnification provision, unless such  
Proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the depositor. Further,  
no indemnification will be made with respect to any settlement or compromise of 
any Proceeding unless and until the depositor has consented to such settlement  
or compromise.                                                                  

The depositor may, from time to time, with the approval of the Board of         
Directors, and to the extent authorized, grant rights to indemnification, and to
the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the depositor or to any
person serving at the request of the depositor as a director or officer, or in  
any other capacity, of any other Enterprise, to the fullest extent of the       
provisions with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of   
directors and officers of the depositor.                                        

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the depositor or the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or     
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as        
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the     
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling   
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or       
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in      
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in 
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will 
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
