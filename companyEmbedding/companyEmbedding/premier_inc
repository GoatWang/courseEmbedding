Premier Inc. Enhances Environmental Stewardship Program




Partnership with MindClick Inc. streamlines purchasing information 
      to quickly identify environmentally preferable products, packaging and 
      services






July 24, 2017 10:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Premier Inc. (NASDAQ: PINC), a leading healthcare improvement company, 
      has partnered with MindClick Inc., a leader in supply chain 
      sustainability solutions, to integrate critical environmental impact 
      data for medical and non-medical products into the purchasing process 
      for hospitals, health systems and other provider organizations.
    


Premier 
      has been the only organization to be recognized for 14 straight 
      years as a leader in environmental excellence, receiving accolades for 
      its commitment to collaborate with member health systems on 
      environmentally preferable purchasing (EPP) and energy efficiency 
      initiatives, as well as daily, company-wide efforts to make informed 
      decisions about sustainable products, services and business practices.
    

      “A recognized leader in environmental excellence, Premier continues to 
      set the bar in the industry for its commitment to EPP and sustainable 
      healthcare practices,” said David Hargraves, senior vice president of 
      supply chain at Premier. “Combining Premier’s technologies with 
      MindClick’s robust medical and non-medical product environmental 
      performance analytics will empower our members to use 
      environmentally-friendly, high-quality, high-value products and devices 
      to better serve their communities.”
    

      Recognizing the need to provide health systems with higher quality EPP 
      data and robust analytical solutions, Premier and MindClick’s 
      partnership integrates Premier’s powerful supply chain predictive 
      analytics with MindClick’s 
      Healthcare Sustainable Purchasing (HCSP) Index™, an automated 
      environmental data analytics solution for suppliers, group purchasing 
      organizations, and healthcare providers.
    

      Premier’s members will benefit from the use of environmental analytics 
      in the contract decision process, access to an integrated robust 
      database of product level environmental and human health impact data, 
      and responsible sourcing benchmarking solutions to help providers 
      quickly and easily make cost-effective, efficient sourcing and 
      contracting decisions that support the total health of their communities.
    

      Premier and MindClick have worked with member health systems, including 
      Fairview Health Services in Minneapolis, to incorporate critical product 
      environmental impact information gathered through the HCSP Index. 
      Factors like optimized packaging, responsible resources and safer 
      chemicals are inserted into the purchasing process. In doing so, health 
      systems are able to compare products and choose those that meet clinical 
      needs, realize cost savings, reduce waste and support the environmental 
      health of their entire community.
    

      “Health systems are challenged today with delivering high quality care 
      at reduced costs, while proactively supporting the health of their 
      populations,” said MindClick CEO JoAnna Abrams. “MindClick and Premier’s 
      partnership delivers powerful responsible purchasing intelligence to 
      help health systems succeed. The solution lies in their supply chains, 
      and the careful selection of high quality, cost effective products which 
      support cleaner, healthier environments through innovative approaches to 
      material choices, use of safer chemicals, more efficient packaging, 
      cleaner energy use, and waste reduction.”
    

      Publicly-accessible resources on patient, worker and green issues in 
      healthcare are available on the Premier 
      Safety Institute website.
    

      The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
