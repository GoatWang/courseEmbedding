Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.

HedgeZ Fund Profile
































JANA Offshore
Partners, Ltd.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        JANA Partners LLC follows a value-oriented, event driven investment strategy focusing on companies considering or implementing strategic change.  Every investment must be fundamentally undervalued on the long side or overvalued on the short side and be involved in an extraordinary corporate transaction which acts as a catalyst to drive the price toward a valuation target. In select circumstances, where the team perceives significant underlying value and where management is unwilling to act to realize that value for shareholders, it may pursue a corporate activist strategy to bring about such action.
