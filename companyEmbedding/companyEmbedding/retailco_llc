Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Investor Evaluating "Strategic Alternatives" for Multiple Start-up Retail Suppliers

December 23, 2013

Email This Story
Copyright 2010-13 EnergyChoiceMatters.com
Reporting by Paul Ring • ring@energychoicematters.com
The original sole member of three start-up retail energy suppliers is currently evaluating "strategic alternatives" for the suppliers.
Specifically, Retailco LLC confirmed to EnergyChoiceMatters.com that it is, "currently evaluating strategic alternatives for Bargain Energy, Emblem Energy and Rushmore Energy."
As only reported by Matters, Bargain Energy, Emblem Energy, and Rushmore Energy are each legally distinct start-up retail suppliers which had received licenses in, or had been seeking licenses in, Pennsylvania.  When formed, each supplier had the same sole member, Retailco, LLC, but each has distinct management.
See prior stories for background on Bargain Energy (click here) and Emblem Energy (click here).
Recently, Emblem Energy, and Rushmore Energy withdrew their applications at the Pennsylvania PUC for electric generation supplier licenses.  Matters is not aware of the companies seeking licenses in any other state.
Bargain Energy had been granted a supplier license in Pennsylvania and launched operations in October, including, at that time, listing offers on PA Power Switch.  It was unclear whether Bargain Energy ever executed any customer enrollments, and if it did, what was or will be the disposition of such customers.
Retailco declined to comment on Bargain Energy's customers or marketing efforts.
Retailco, LLC is a Texas LLC whose CEO is W. Keith Maxwell III, according to Texas Secretary of State records. Maxwell, along with several other individuals, are members of Retailco, LLC.  Maxwell is also CEO and founder of Spark Energy
"While Retailco has a common shareholder with Spark Energy, they are entirely separate in terms of day to day operations and Retailco's decision has no impact on Spark Energy's continued growth and commitment to its customers," Spark Energy told Matters.

The master service agreement between the parties was approved by a special committee, formed by the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors. Spark is filing a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the execution of this agreement that will include a summary of key terms. About Spark Energy, Inc.
