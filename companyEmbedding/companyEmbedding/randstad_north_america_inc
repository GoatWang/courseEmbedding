About Randstad North America, Inc.

   Randstad Holding has the supply to meet nearly any demand. The company is one of the largest temporary staffing and employment services agencies in the world (behind Adecco). It operates primarily in Europe, but also in Asia and North America, under the Randstad brand and several others, including Sapphire Technologies (IT staffing), Yacht (industrial staffing), and Tempo-Team (general staffing). Through almost 4,200 locations in more than 40 countries, Randstad supplies temporary workers for small assignments as well as large-scale deployments. It also offers permanent placement and HR project management and consultancy services. Randstad Holding was established in 1960.
   Operations

   Randstad's operations are divided across four business segments: staffing, professionals, HR solutions (payroll services, HR consulting, and vendor management services), and in-house services (works onsite with clients primarily residing in the manufacturing and logistics sectors).
  
Financial Performance

   The company's total annual revenue increased from $22.5 billion in fiscal 2012 up to $22.8 billion in fiscal 2013. Randstad's net income increased from $48.5 million in fiscal 2012 to $317.5 million in fiscal 2013 on the strength of the gross annual revenue.
  
Strategy

   Believing that the Japanese market is one of the largest staffing markets in the world, Randstad is looking to the country as an important location for achieving growth.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In a highly acquisitive period in mid-2016, Randstad made five acquisitions - two technology related, and three recruitment related. It acquired Obiettivo Lavoro, an Italian recruitment firm, for around $103 million; twago, a leading European freelance marketplace; and online recruitment firm Monster, for around $430 million. The acquisition of Monster, one of the largest online jobsites, is a significant step into online recruitment for Randstad.
  

   The technology acquisitions are Japanese IT and engineering firm Careo Group and French company Ausy, a consulting and engineering firm that will help Randstad broaden its technology and engineering capabilities.
