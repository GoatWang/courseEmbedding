We're solving interesting challenges, communication is open, employees are a mix of gritty and quirky awesomely smart people who I get to work with ever day. Tons of autonomy, collaboration, and growth potential here. I feel incredibly lucky and privileged to work at such an amazing company where I truly sense that I make an impact and get to hang out with awesome people all day long.ConsNot many- I think some people are too entitled and expect too much as this is many people's first job. This company does a fantastic job taking care of us. They listen, they care. They value our opinions. We're going through some natural challenging times as we transition into a larger company, but overall we have the same soul that makes us who we are back when were were just 40 people.Advice to ManagementContinue to be as open, transparent, and accessible as you have been in the past. Continue to hold the company to the standard that you have for the past 8 years and let's just keep doing what we're doing together.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) The Trade Desk Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Trade Desk 2017-07-13 21:29 PDT Jul 9, 2017 Helpful (2)"amazing product, good people (for the most part), but not a perfect company."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at The Trade Desk full-time (Less than a year)Pros- first of all, TTD is an amazing product and clients absolutely love it. the commitment to service level is absolutely there. they're also one of the moral companies in ad-tech and the CEO, Jeff Green, is a genuinely good guy who does what he says he's going to do.- benefits are very solid (ESPP, 401k, vision is amazing, dental, health, etc.) and the company does take care of its employees in that respect. you can expect typical start-up checklist items like catered lunch twice a week, stocked fridges for snacks, standing desks, etc. in most offices.Cons- there have been some pretty severe commission issues and they do claw back commissions when receivables are unpaid by agencies. before this, several people were not getting paid for months at a time. for a company that touts transparency, there is frankly zero transparency into how people get what commission (AM teams get paid based off of some mysterious merit-based commission structure).- there's also an intensely kool-aid culture in some respects. i almost feel like i'm committing sacrilege by giving TTD less than 5 stars and putting my job security at risk. there are many situations where you'll be heavily vilified by other team members for leaving before 7-8 o'clock. this is not a WFH friendly company in almost all situations with a few exceptions and you should not expect to take any vacations sept-december.- i've heard that a couple VP-level folks are downright mean. keep in mind that for the most part, people are super super nice and great to be around so it really depends on your team.Advice to Managementbe more transparent to your employees about how they get paid, especially AM/sales/business team folks. accept that people have their schedules and extracurriculars and encourage less vilification by hiring more people instead of working them to the bone in some cases.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) The Trade Desk Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Trade Desk 2017-07-09 22:46 PDT Join the The Trade Desk team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 5, 2017 Helpful (2)"Pretty Great Place to Work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Software Engineer in Ventura, CACurrent Employee - Software Engineer in Ventura, CARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at The Trade Desk full-time (More than a year)ProsThis company has a pretty great engineering culture, definitely better than any company I've worked for before. We have great benefits such that I feel our leadership actually gives a crap about its employees. Morale is generally great, and it's a very positive environment. People in every department believe in what we're doing. The positivity is often infectious. The pace really fast. It's great, but sometimes it's too much. Our technology stack works fairly well and is pretty scalable. We have a lot of really tough engineering challenges.ConsTitles are arbitrary. It's unfortunate that a company that has got so many other things right can't seem to get this right. TTD is no different than other companies I've worked for in that regard. Titles and promotions are sometimes given for seemingly no reason. Some people have titles they shouldn't have; others should have titles that they don't. Maybe it's the tech industry in general, but it sucks.We move too fast for our own good sometimes. Work-life balance is tough when you run a platform that requires attention 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.Advice to ManagementKeep an eye out for culture shift with growth. It's happening.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) The Trade Desk Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Trade Desk 2017-07-05 10:21 PDT Jun 5, 2017 Helpful (4)"Can still be a good thing"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYApproves of CEOI have been working at The Trade Desk full-time (More than a year)ProsFast moving company , who can keep up with the pace of the industry. You are surround by Best and brightest in ad tech. Everyone is generous with their time and always willing to lend a helping hand.ConsThe strive for success can over shadow the happiness of employees. Starting to feel very corporate.Sales and Product teams thrive, where other teams struggle with vision and defining career paths.Morale is on the decline as the company shifts thinking towards revenue.Advice to ManagementAccess the happiness of employees. Do not just dismiss unhappiness and attribute it as being unmotivated or unwillingness to contribute since it probably didn't start off that way.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) The Trade Desk Response seconds agoEdit • Delete The Trade Desk 2017-06-05 18:19 PDT May 27, 2017"No place I'd rather be"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Software Engineer in San Jose, CACurrent Employee - Software Engineer in San Jose, CARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at The Trade Desk full-time (More than 3 years)ProsThis company is the real deal.I've spent many years writing software and I've worked for many companies, the Trade Desk has a very unique blend of culture, market position, strategy and success.The people here really like each other and enjoy the time that they spend together. The company understands how important culture is to their overall success and shows time and again that the culture cannot be risked in the pursuit of other goals. There is no lip-service to this here.The engineering team has scaled very nicely using methodologies that many other companies wouldn't dare attempt; distribution of development around the world and shared ownership of all key components. There also is absolutely no benefit to being in the "home office". This is a tremendous benefit to the people that do not want to live in the expensive areas where tech and the advertising world tend to congregate. People can work on any project from any location around the world. That's very rare in the world of software development.We celebrate company successes more than individual successes (though we recognize and celebrate those as well) and there is a constant focus on doing things that make the company and our customers successful.There is a good mix of short-term and long-term focus in development. It is so easy in a world of limited resources and unlimited things to build to focus only on what can make us the most money tomorrow while not planning for what's needed in 6 months or a year. That always leads to tons of pain down the road.Somehow, even with all of that, work/life balance is as good as it gets. People work hard and then go home. Our office lights up around 8am every day and nobody is ever there past 6:30p. Most people in the office work a solid 8.5 hour day and we typically eat lunch together, including two days a week when lunch is provided by the company.tl;dr; best job I've ever had.ConsI really had to think about something significant here. It really is difficult to come up with something that I feel is much more difficult at the Trade Desk than other places that I've worked. The biggest difficulty in our office is that we can't find enough engineers who are qualified to do the job and who find their way through the door.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Named to Crain's New York Business 2016 Best Places to Work in New York CityKayla Vatalaro, New York-based Director of Talent Acquisition, added, "We have a dedicated team in New York and across the globe who focus on creating an innovative and collaborative environment for our employees, while also bringing on new members who embody the same tenacity, creativity and grit that our current team possesses.See AllSee AllThe Trade Desk – Why Work For Us?Why Work For Us?About UsOpen PositionsOur PeopleOur EngineersOur Offices About Us Open Positions Our People Our Engineers Our OfficesThe Trade Desk is the fastest-growing adtech platform for a reason – our people. We’re here because we believe we’re building something special, and we’re looking for good people to pitch in. Our culture is innovative, energetic, and collaborative. Those aren’t perks – those are just the way we do business.Our story starts in 2009, when founder and CEO Jeff Green leaves Microsoft after they acquired his previous venture, online ad exchange AdECN, in 2007. Jeff and TTD cofounder Dave Pickles decide to build the most robust, agile, and expressive programmatic platform advertising has ever seen. Cut to 2016: our engineers still ship product weekly for clients across the globe.Our goal? To bring unparalleled sophistication to online advertising. And although we’re a technology platform, it all starts with our team.Our engineers are agile and build against the full stack. They bring new ideas to the table and work shoulder-to-shoulder with business and product to produce tech that was recently recognized by Forrester Research as “a better option for buyers.”Our media traders have degrees in economics and statistics from top universities and many made the jump into advertising from careers on Wall Street. They’re numbers people with a passion for pivots, and always up for a raucous session of ping pong.Our sales and accounts teams are advisors and strategists. They have managed clients, marketing strategy, and advertising campaigns at companies such as JWT, WebMD, DoubleVerify, Google, and Microsoft. They’re deep on the details of our tech and a whole lot of fun at happy hour.Sound like the kind of people you’d like to spend your days with? We invite you to come make an impact.Read moreJoin Us.Read moreBehind People of ProgrammaticAt The Trade Desk, we love stories. Though our platform is rooted in technology, when you boil down what our pipes are doing, we’re really helping marketers tell their stories cohesively and memorably across all touch points.And now, it’s our turn.As you may have noticed, we recently launched our People of Programmatic campaign, in partnership with Digiday. The concept is a play on the popular Humans of New York blog and books, which so enchantingly captures the stories of New Yorkers and beyond. The Trade Desk is filled with interesting and unique characters, who each took their own path to get here and we wanted to share their perspective in the same way.Their stances are distinct, their backgrounds are different and their stories are great. Don’t just take my word for it, read the series of interviews and see for yourself.   - Kayla Vatalaro, Director of Talent Acquisition Read moreWith integrations into every major advertising exchange, we handle well over 4 trillion requests every month and growing – that's more page views and queries than Facebook, Google Search, and Google's entire network of websites combined – all serviced in single-digit-ms response times. Are you interested in working with big data? Do you want to push the edges of scale and responsiveness? It doesn't get much bigger or faster than this!We are looking for full-stack SOA engineers with grit. Every day we're solving problems that have either never been solved before, or have never been solved at this scale. We run our team very fast and very lean, which means every engineer has a high degree of ownership and potential impact – and we are looking for candidates with the chops to handle it.Recently named one of the top 10 most promising companies in America by Forbes Magazine and one of the "Best Places To Work" in the nation by Outdoor Magazine, The Trade Desk offers a culture of "relaxed intensity" – one that comes from working alongside one of the most talented teams in our industry, and leading in a race that is ours to lose.You might be a great fit for The Trade Desk development team if:You are a full-stack SOA engineer / generalist. Experience and (just as important) interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA is a must for our team. This includes (walking down the stack): AngularJS SPA development, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, no-SQL and relational SQL databases, big data processing (e.g. data bus architecture, Hadoop / MPP data warehouse, etc.), and data visualization (e.g. Tableau). Experience in all these layers is not strictly required, but we do like to see experience working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all (because they often will).You have a track record of significant, specific, and self-directed contributions to large and challenging projects. What we're getting at here is "grit" or "street cred" – some proof that this isn’t your first rodeo, and you have learned some lessons the hard way.You lead withhumility and confidence. Our engineers have the opportunity (and are expected) to exercise a high degree of leadership and expertise in their daily work, having strongly held and defensible ideas, and advocating for what they believe is right. But they also need to be eager to hear differing opinions, adept at identifying and evaluating tradeoffs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to help out their follow teammates.You have product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do a lot of development in C#/.NET, but specific experience here is not required.Read moreWe are GLOBALLY united.We have offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia.Learn More.Read moreThe Trade Desk ReviewsThe Trade Desk884.8StarStarStarStarStarRating TrendsRating TrendsRecommend to a friendApprove of CEOJeff Green77 Ratings Jul 13, 2017 Helpful (1)"Truly a special place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at The Trade Desk full-time (More than 3 years)ProsHonestly it's such a special place to work. We're solving interesting challenges, communication is open, employees are a mix of gritty and quirky awesomely smart people who I get to work with ever day. Tons of autonomy, collaboration, and growth potential here. I feel incredibly lucky and privileged to work at such an amazing company where I truly sense that I make an impact and get to hang out with awesome people all day long.ConsNot many- I think some people are too entitled and expect too much as this is many people's first job. This company does a fantastic job taking care of us. They listen, they care. They value our opinions. We're going through some natural challenging times as we transition into a larger company, but overall we have the same soul that makes us who we are back when were were just 40 people.Advice to ManagementContinue to be as open, transparent, and accessible as you have been in the past. Continue to hold the company to the standard that you have for the past 8 years and let's just keep doing what we're doing together.
