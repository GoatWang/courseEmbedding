Why the new incubator is huge for Des Moines


News broke today that a new incubator/accelerator will be formed in Des Moines that focuses on insurance startups. You can read more about that on the DSM Register article by Marco Santana here. This is a huge momentum shift for the startup scene and I am pumped about this development. Des Moines has always been known as the “Insurance Capital of the US”. With the likes of Principal Financial, Aviva, American Equity, Delta Dental, EMC, Wellmark, Farm Bureau and more. This is a perfect scenario to continue the startup scene in this area that so many have been actively involved in. Focusing on what you are good at, is the best way to build a community. There are many more opportunities for similar incubators for Agriculture (Pioneer) and Media (Meredith). As phase one to continue this momentum we have in Des Moines for startup activity, I’m excited to watch this play out. More importantly, I think this will bring people into Des Moines to see why this truly is the best place to live and grow a startup business. Kudos to all that were involved in putting this together. #onward

Thank you Ben


I recently returned from a trip to New York to watch my beloved Cyclones lose to UCONN in the Sweet 16. Basketball took 2nd place on the trip to several meetings I had with VC firms. In each meeting, when asked where we were located I said “Des Moines”. The response each time “I hear there are a lot of good things going on there." Dwolla was mentioned each time. For that, thank you Ben and the Dwolla team for placing us on the map. Your hard work building Dwolla from Des Moines and expanding the network to the coasts has without a doubt helped this tech community. We can build here. It makes sense to build here. People respect what is going on here.Don’t forget that. Lets keep going.

Disconnecting is refreshing


I just returned last night from a 5 day trip to Cancun for a good friends wedding. I specifically left my computer, iPad & phone disconnected. It was an experiment for me as I am never more than an email, phone call, tweet, FB status update away from being connected or contacted for work or non work related issues.  It was the most refreshing trip I have ever had and I highly recommend it. What was more interesting to me was that everyone who was on the trip did the same thing. At dinner, having drinks, at the pool or just sitting on the beach - nobody was checking phones or sending texts on where to meet up. Everything happened organically. The only thing I checked was basketball scores. And in that case, I should have never checked because my beloved Cyclones dropped two games while I was away. Wish I wouldn’t have known that :)So get away. Disconnect. Refresh. In the world we live in, you have to do it!

Someone who nailed what I was trying to say 


So this morning, again I had a conversation with a well known business person in Des Moines after he had heard through the grapevine about my blog post that was received as negative to the investor community in Des Moines. For that I apologize, a million times over. For those who would like to read exactly what I was trying to say - in a much more balanced and non argumentative way, please read John Jackovin’s post on the Welch Avenue Blog. Iowa..Des Moines in particular is a small town where like Norm, everyone knows your name. To those investors who I have offended in my early post. I do apologize.We have a lot of work to do together, and I look forward to that day.

Adios Valley Junction our journey is not over 


The Goodsmiths office in Valley Junction is officially coming to an end tomorrow. This transition is both disappointing and bittersweet. The opportunity to go to Startup City Des Moines in the next phase of Goodsmiths is something that we are very excited about. All of the meetups that have been hosted at our office, the one thing that many have said is that this space is meant for creativity. We used this space to create what we have today and we had a blast doing it. There are many chapters to the evolution of a startup. This is the end of chapter 1. We look forward to moving on and continuing the success with our peers in the startup community. #onward

My social experiment 


The other day I asked Twitter followers and Facebook friends what they thought about this chart: “what’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this chart?”Please note: no title. No reference of what this was. No Y-axis. This was done on purpose.Some responses: New customer acquisition Growth?“Please let this be my net worth” - signed a shareholder Fred Hoiberg’s stock - my favorite answer, #gostateHow to lie with Twitter? - no idea here A bright futureResponses from Facebook ranged from: Sales/Growth/Profits Stocks Household expenses since my son was born. (absolutely) Reverse Cubs losses since 2003 (very true, unfortunately)Every revenue projection ever pitched to an investor So the truth is that this is not only a rough outline of the growth of Amazon’s stock - but also a chart of the number of monthly transactions that have occurred on the Goodsmiths marketplace (approaching 5k).Amazon stock chart: Goodsmiths # of transactions per month: My point is to not completely put Amazon vs Goodsmiths in any way shape or form. Amazon is in a class alone because they are simply the best at what they do. Customers love them. They have multiple revenue streams and continue to innovate like crazy. These are all reasons why Amazon is far and away my favorite company & why they continue to drive shareholder value.  When you have a marketplace online that innovates through the smallest of things that many do not notice, like the checkout process, you see trends like number of transactions continue to rise. You see other conversion metrics like the e-commerce checkout conversion rate follow a similar trend: This isn’t just a website that allows people to sell things - our job is to create and build technologies that allow people to feel good about buying from & supporting makers. It’s interesting to see what others think about charts that are moving up and to the right when they have no idea what it is. I think its a safe assumption that placing our growth charts on top of other very well known companies is a positive sign that we are in fact moving in the right direction with momentum. Would we like to have 8,000 monthly transactions and not 800? Absolutely, and we will get there. This takes time. Twitter made $0 for almost 3 years, and now they have a $33.4 billion market cap.   I had coffee with a very well known artist here in Des Moines today, whom to my surprise knew every single thing that we were doing. From our business, to our future plans. One thing stuck out to me that he said: “It may seem like you feel like you have been doing this forever and that you are getting squashed with emotions of failure. You have to look at what you guys have built and why you are doing it. You think you have been tested now, just wait.”Needless to say, it was one of the best coffee meetings I have ever had, and one more reason why I love Des Moines. #onward

Why Entrepreneurs love choppy waters


This morning was unlike any other morning. Wake up with a full head of steam ready to tackle whatever challenges await. As outlined in a previous post, we’ve had our successes/failures & struggles at Goodsmiths. And now, its for all to see with a recent article written by Marco Santana at The Des Moines Register. The headline: To the untrained eye who knows nothing about running a startup or starting any business, the immediate response is: “Oh holy hell, the boat is sinking, ermahgerd!" To the entrepreneur the response is: "Yup, lets grab a big ass boat and go sailing” (btw I only see “Revenue is up” in the title, anyone else?) I had to visit my Grandfather this morning to take care of an issue with his internet and phone service at his retirement center. He was at breakfast, so I starting messing around to see if I could figure it out. He strolls in on his electric cart and the first words out of his mouth: “Was just reading the article in the paper this morning, everything alright?” He didn’t give a rip that his phone/internet has been out for 3 days, cutting him off from all communication. He only cared and wanted to have a conversation about how things were going. “As I told you before, if there was anything I could help you with, I would”.  Several other people contacted me this morning through email and through messages on Facebook. “Let me know how I can help”. This is an amazing feeling. The fact of the matter is this: every single startup goes through choppy waters. The ones who succeed are the ones who keep paddling their way to get to the final destination.We are back to where we once started several years ago. Levi and I, two entrepreneurs who see a problem that needs to be solved. A market that is too large, with only one prominent player (who of late is making a huge mistake).So onward we go with the amazing support of the Des Moines Startup community. We are all in this together. While media portrays things in one light (to display to others here that startups are hard), there is always a different light switch to turn on. ^^ Thanks Jeff#Onward

SnapChat did what?


I am not a SnapChat user, and as my friend Brian Norgard pointed out to me in a tweet, "It’s extremely easy to be critical of something your peer group doesn’t use. SnapChat is for real" I agree 100%. I’m not going to be critical of something my friends don’t use. What I am going to be critical of is the thought process one must go through to make this decision to spur a $3 billion dollar all cash offer from a company that has over 1 billion users. All the while, realizing that there are zero positive entries into your books for revenue. Apparently, this is the norm for some startups that live outside of the Midwest..because its pretty important around here to not only have users/growth but also some revenue to show investors you know what the fuck you are doing.    There have been multiple comparisons today between what SnapChat did vs what Twitter didn’t do or what Instagram did do. Instagram’s success seemed to happen at the right time/right place - more and more opportunities to share photos on your mobile device to Twitter and Facebook. More opportunities to put a sepia filter on your ribeye steak you just grilled with the sunset in the background. Instagram was smart because they knew what their product was, and they knew it was their time to say thanks for the $1 billion. How the hell do you innovate fucking photo filters? Twitter on the other hand, didn’t necessarily have a business model from day one. I know first hand through my run with Twittad, that Ev Williams and others within Twitter didn’t even know how they would incorporate ads. I’d argue they had no idea how the hell they were going to make money. Period. But more and more people started using Twitter, and more opportunities came forward where they could integrate and partner with media, news organizations, photos, famous people - all things advertisers LOVE. With SnapChat, I don’t see it. I saw a tweet earlier today from someone I follow (wish I would have screen shot it) - where they thought SnapChat could make $35/mil a day by simply placing an advertisement after the photo goes away within the app. Thats all fine and dandy..go for it. But where is the targeting?  With Twitter, their targeting is spot on. As an advertiser for example, we can target a sponsored tweet to show up in the stream of a Twitter user who mentions Etsy. It works. Very well. I’d imagine other major brands are starting to see the same thing and are giving their marketing departments more $ to spend. A far cry from when I used to sit with Sears trying to sell them a campaign on our little ad network to @ reply when someone mentions their competition.I think of SnapChat very similarly as Instagram. You have a sweet product that a ton of people (mostly tweens) are using. Well done gents. But now, its big time boys. You spurred an offer for $3 billion all cash after raising $73 million in venture capital. It won’t be your company for much longer. Look at Twitter for a prime example. Biz cashed out along the way during capital raises (anyone notice he was no where to be found on the documents having shares during the IPO?). Jack and Ev apparently had spats and all along the way the venture capitalists wanted Twitter to “grow up”. In comes Dick Costolo (with tremendous advertising experience) to turn Twitter into a big boy company.  So this decision for Evan and Bobby at SnapChat might not have been a decision they had control over. From the outside, I see nothing but problems for them as they try to “grow up” like Twitter had to do. Brands aren’t going to want to advertise their product after some d-bag posts a SnapChat of his junk. So good luck with the ad targeting. You probably should have thought of that before telling Zuck no on a $3 billion dollar wire transfer.

Response to Etsy’s recent changes


Post originally appeared on The GoodWeekly Hello everyone,I wanted to take a few minutes to address what a lot of you are discussing on message boards and on Etsy’s Forum. The recent changes made by Etsy should be a major concern for all individuals who take pride in the handmade community. Their decision to allow sellers to use manufacturers goes against the values that many of  us, as makers, hold close to our hearts.Being a “Maker” is one of the most powerful and self-filling beliefs for those who are passionate about their craft. In the past Etsy has turned a blind eye to individuals who have used others to help produce their items. Now, they are allowing users to apply/notify Etsy that they are using other resources to produce their items. I have a few thoughts on this:As many of you may or may not know, Goodsmiths, Etsy and others are in the business of building a long sustainable e-commerce marketplace. Not only for us, but also for you. The Etsy CEO, during the Town Hall Meeting, said “The times are changing with regards to producing and keeping up with volumes of orders.” One would assume that he is answering directly to the articles recently published explaining that Etsy’s economy is crumbling because of the overwhelming orders coming into shops. Further, he is probably addressing the major concerns many have with regards to the amount of items in their marketplace that are coming from overseas. Etsy has raised a significant amount of venture capital ($91.7 million to be exact). Because of this, there are two options for Etsy - 1) Go Public (stock market) or 2) sell the company for well north of $1billion. Because of this…Etsy had to make these changes in their policies public because if #1 above (stock market) is true, they have to cover the probable situation of having buyers file lawsuits for “deceptive selling practices.” Imagine a scenario where you purchased something from a shop located in Des Moines, Iowa only to receive the package that says it was shipped from China. Maybe something is wrong with the item (that is a long trip from China..maybe it broke). But you, as the buyer, had no idea this was coming from China. Without these recent changes, the liability would fall directly on Etsy’s shoulders. With the recent changes, Etsy is allowed to answer “The seller never indicated to us they were using a manufacture to produce their goods.” Their hands are wiped clean, and it’s the sellers problem.That is the business side of what is not being discussed.The Goodsmiths vision is to create the most affordable and tech savvy marketplace for makers of all kinds. Our tagline: The Marketplace for Makers speaks volumes to what our vision is. So what are our plans?Currently on Goodsmiths, you are able to list handmade and vintage goods. We ask no questions, but I can assure you there are individuals who review and take a look at all shops on our platform. We know there are some makers in our community who probably do not belong on our marketplace. As you can probably imagine, this is a difficult process. As you can also imagine, without $91.7 million in venture capital and a small and nimble team, we might be a little slower on the policing. As you saw in the Etsy Town Hall Meeting yesterday, a majority of questions were directed to the individual in charge of the policy team. This isn’t easy. But the quick and easy answer to this, is that we are working as hard as we can to monitor the entire marketplace.In the future, if we were to make the decision to allow shop owners to use a manufacturer to produce their goods, we will do a few things:1) These items would be completely separate of the current marketplace. In fact, these items will probably live on a completely different website. A good produced at a factory, or even with a 3D printer does not belong side by side with items that were produced by hand. Period.2) We will never, ever get away from the handmade community. We, as the entrepreneurs creating Goodsmiths, are makers too. We are driven every single day to build a better marketplace for handmade.Many of you have been on Goodsmiths since we launched in April of 2012. Many of you are upset that you have not had any sales on Goodsmiths. I understand your concern. Over the course of the last few months we have reviewed our processes and more importantly the process for setting up a shop on Goodsmiths. Because of this, it is more important than ever to review your shop after you have imported your items from Etsy. We recently sent out a shop emailer to notify you of a few things you can do to improve your shop and the search engine optimization. I invite all of you to review it, and email us with any questions.We are moving forward with Goodsmiths. Now more than ever we believe that the decisions made by Etsy, will ultimately increase the amount non-handmade and mass produced goods on their marketplace. If you are new to Goodsmiths, and are reading this for the very first time, I invite you to sign up. We have a free account, and if you would like to signup for one of our paid accounts, please use the code ETSY (use the all CAPS please) to receive 6 months free of any paid account.Best,JamesCo-Founder/CEO
