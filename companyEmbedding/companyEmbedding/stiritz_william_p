A Cereal Company Exec Has Lost $218 Million Of His Own Money On Herbalife

William "Bill"
  Stiritz.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post identified
  William Stiritz as the CEO of Post Holdings. Stiritz stepped down
  as CEO on November 1, 2014 to become executive chairman of the
  company. @BarbarianCapital was the first to point it out.


  William "Bill" Stiritz — Herbalife's largest shareholder — has
  gotten absolutely annihilated on his stake in the nutritional
  company.


  According to our estimates, he has lost about $218.8 million on
  his investment so far. 


  Stiritz is the
  former CEO of the food company Post Holdings.


Herbalife — a multilevel marketing firm that sells
  nutrition products like weight-loss shakes and vitamins— has been
  at the center of a hedge fund war for over two years.


  Activist investor Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square
  Capital, publicly announced in December 2012 that he was shorting
  the company to $0.


  Ackman's thesis is that the company operates as a "pyramid
  scheme" that targets poor people. He believes regulators,
  specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will shut the company
  down. (The FTC opened
  an investigation in March 2014). 


After Ackman made his short public, numerous hedge fund
  managers, most notably Carl Icahn, piled on by going long the
  stock. In the months following Ackman's initial presentation,
  share of Herbalife skyrocketed and Ackman rocked up millions in
  paper losses. 


Ackman is now
  back in the money on his position as the stock has declined in
  recent months.


And those who
  were long are feeling the pain. 


Stiritz, 79,
  has racked up hundreds of millions in paper losses, according to
  our calculations. 


  On Sept. 3, 2013, Stiritz disclosed
  a huge long Herbalife position. At the time, Stiritz owned
  5,382,362 shares, or a 5.22% stake. We estimated then
  that Stiritz's Herbalife stake was worth about $322 million. The
  stock closed at $59.90 the day he disclosed that
  position.


  On Nov. 18, 2013, (when Herbalife was at $67.20) and again on
  Jan. 29, 2014, (when Herbalife was at $62.82), Stiritz added to
  his position. He most recently held 7,484,804 shares, or an
  8.15% stake, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. 


  Since Stiritz first reported the position, shares of Herbalife
  have slumped more than 46%. The stock was trading down 2.5% on
  Tuesday morning at $32.12 per share.


Using the closing price of the days on which Stiritz
  disclosed his stakes, we calculate that he has lost an estimated
  $218.8 million on his Herbalife investment so
  far.


The second-largest shareholder is Herbalife's CEO Michael
  Johnson, and he owns just over 1.38 million shares. 


We don't know
  Stiritz's personal net worth. He's not mentioned on the
  billionaire lists from either Forbes or Bloomberg.  


  Stiritz is Post Holdings' largest individual shareholder, with
  approximately 369,662 shares, Bloomberg data shows. His Post
  stake is worth just over $15.1 million based on Monday's closing
  price.

Post Holdings Announces Management Changes; Bill Stiritz to Become Executive Chairman; Rob Vitale to Become President and CEO




















October 09, 2014 17:01 ET

 | Source: Post Holdings, Inc.





ST. LOUIS, Oct. 9, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST), a consumer packaged goods holding company, today announced several management changes and a reorganization of its businesses.

Management Changes

The following management changes will all be effective November 1, 2014.

	William P. Stiritz, who has served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since Post separated from Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. in 2012, will continue with Post's executive team in the newly-created role of Executive Chairman. In connection with this new role, Mr. Stiritz's employment agreement was extended to October 2017.

	Robert V. Vitale has been named President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Vitale has served as Post's Chief Financial Officer since its formation in October 2011.   Mr. Vitale has also been named to Post's Board of Directors.

	Terence E. Block, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, has decided to retire from Post.  Mr. Block will also retire from Post's Board of Directors. "Terry was instrumental in our start-up phase as we separated from Ralcorp.  I understand his decision and I wish him very well as he enters this stage of life," said Bill Stiritz. 

	In commenting, Mr. Block said, "It has been very satisfying to have worked alongside a talented leadership team and take what was an underperforming business and in less than three years build a diversified consumer goods enterprise with improved growth prospects.  This is an opportune time to transition out of the business and I wish Bill, Rob, and the team continued success."

Business Reorganization

	Post is reorganizing around three distinct groups.  Post's newly formed Consumer Brands Group includes the legacy Post Foods cereal operations as well as the recently acquired active nutrition businesses of Premier Nutrition Corporation, Dymatize Enterprises and the PowerBar and Musashi brands. James L. Holbrook has been named President and CEO of the Consumer Brands Group. Mr. Holbrook has served as Post's Executive Vice President, Marketing since October 2011 and as President, Post Foods since January 2014. 

	The Michael Foods Group is now comprised of the Michael Foods' egg, cheese and potato businesses, which Post acquired in June 2014, and Dakota Growers Pasta Company, acquired in January 2014. It will be headed by James E. Dwyer, Jr. as President and CEO. Mr. Dwyer has led Michael Foods since 2009. 

	Messrs. Holbrook and Dwyer have also been named Executive Vice Presidents of Post Holdings, Inc. 

	Post's remaining businesses, consisting of Golden Boy Foods and Attune Foods, will comprise the Private Label Group. This Group will report directly to Mr. Vitale.

	"The most valuable asset a company can have is a management team capable of adapting to a changing environment," said Bill Stiritz. "I feel very confident moving into the next stage of our development. This team is among the best I have seen."

	Commenting on the changes, Rob Vitale said, "I appreciate the confidence that Bill and the Board have shown in this team.  Post's prospects are exciting.  Under Jim Holbrook's leadership Post Foods has made remarkable progress and adding the active nutrition brands to Jim's group gives him the ability to deploy the resources of the Post organization against a larger opportunity.  Meanwhile, under Jim Dwyer, we have one of the premier foodservice businesses in the country in Michael Foods, with exciting expansion opportunities.  I look forward to working with Bill, Jim and Jim to build upon Post's great history."

Herbalife's Biggest Individual Shareholder Is Getting Smoked

  Herbalife's largest individual shareholder is in the red.


On Monday,
  shares of Herbalife 
  tanked into Monday's close. 
The stock fell 10.31% to end the day at
  $40.21 per share on a false rumor that Carl Icahn was unwinding
  his position. The stock was last up about 3% in the pre-market on
  Tuesday.


Herbalife is a
  multilevel marketing firm that sells nutrition products like
  weight-loss shakes and vitamins. The company has been at the
  center of a huge hedge fund war for nearly 20 months.


For a while, a
  lot of attention has been focused on the losses that the hedge
  fund manager Bill Ackman has amassed on his infamous short.
  Things have been looking better for him in the past couple of
  weeks, though. 


Meanwhile,
  Herbalife's largest individual shareholder, William "Bill"
  Stiritz, has racked up millions in paper losses. 


  On Sept. 3, 2013, 
  the 78-year-old investor disclosed his massive Herbalife
  position. At the time, Stiritz owned 5,382,362 shares, or a
  5.22% stake. We estimated then that
  Stiritz's Herbalife stake was worth about $322 million or so. The
  stock closed at $59.90 the day he disclosed that
  position.


  Then, on Nov. 18, 2013, (when Herbalife was at $67.20) and again
  on Jan. 29, 2014, (when Herbalife was at $62.82), Stiritz added
  to his position. He last held 7,484,804 shares, or an
  8.15% stake, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. 


Shares of
  Herbalife are down more than 25% since Stiritz first disclosed
  his position. So far this year, they're down more than
  49%. 


Based on our
  rough estimates using the closing price of the days when he
  disclosed his stakes, Stiritz has experienced an estimated $145
  million in paper losses on his Herbalife investment.


  His stake is massive for an individual. To put things into
  perspective, the second-biggest individual shareholder is
  Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson. Johnson owns just over a
  million shares. 


  It's unclear what Stiritz's personal net worth is. We couldn't
  find him mentioned on any Forbes' billionaires' lists. 


  Stiritz is currently
  the CEO and chairman of the food company Post Holdings. He's
  also Post's largest individual shareholder with approximately
  369,662 shares, or a 0.82% stake, Bloomberg data shows. His Post
  stake was worth just over $28.9 million as of Monday's close.

Herbalife's Biggest Individual Shareholder Is Getting Smoked

  Herbalife's largest individual shareholder is in the red.


On Monday,
  shares of Herbalife 
  tanked into Monday's close. 
The stock fell 10.31% to end the day at
  $40.21 per share on a false rumor that Carl Icahn was unwinding
  his position. The stock was last up about 3% in the pre-market on
  Tuesday.


Herbalife is a
  multilevel marketing firm that sells nutrition products like
  weight-loss shakes and vitamins. The company has been at the
  center of a huge hedge fund war for nearly 20 months.


For a while, a
  lot of attention has been focused on the losses that the hedge
  fund manager Bill Ackman has amassed on his infamous short.
  Things have been looking better for him in the past couple of
  weeks, though. 


Meanwhile,
  Herbalife's largest individual shareholder, William "Bill"
  Stiritz, has racked up millions in paper losses. 


  On Sept. 3, 2013, 
  the 78-year-old investor disclosed his massive Herbalife
  position. At the time, Stiritz owned 5,382,362 shares, or a
  5.22% stake. We estimated then that
  Stiritz's Herbalife stake was worth about $322 million or so. The
  stock closed at $59.90 the day he disclosed that
  position.


  Then, on Nov. 18, 2013, (when Herbalife was at $67.20) and again
  on Jan. 29, 2014, (when Herbalife was at $62.82), Stiritz added
  to his position. He last held 7,484,804 shares, or an
  8.15% stake, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. 


Shares of
  Herbalife are down more than 25% since Stiritz first disclosed
  his position. So far this year, they're down more than
  49%. 


Based on our
  rough estimates using the closing price of the days when he
  disclosed his stakes, Stiritz has experienced an estimated $145
  million in paper losses on his Herbalife investment.


  His stake is massive for an individual. To put things into
  perspective, the second-biggest individual shareholder is
  Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson. Johnson owns just over a
  million shares. 


  It's unclear what Stiritz's personal net worth is. We couldn't
  find him mentioned on any Forbes' billionaires' lists. 


  Stiritz is currently
  the CEO and chairman of the food company Post Holdings. He's
  also Post's largest individual shareholder with approximately
  369,662 shares, or a 0.82% stake, Bloomberg data shows. His Post
  stake was worth just over $28.9 million as of Monday's close.
