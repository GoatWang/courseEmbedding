KaZoom Kids Books, the Publishing Company Dedicated to Multicultural, Digital – Interactive Children’s Book has Launched a Kickstarter Campaign
 
CHICAGO, IL. 4/25/2017 –KaZoom Kids Books, Inc,  a multicultural, digital-interactive children’s book publishing company, has launched its Kickstarter campaign. KaZoom is the first interactive digital publishing company in the United States focusing exclusively on the multicultural market, and most precisely Black and Latino readers.
Based in Chicago KaZoom’s flagship product is KaZoom Kids iStoryBooks – an innovative, interactive library of multicultural children’s book apps bringing technology magic to traditional print. The company publishes multicultural books and apps for ages 3 to 8. The books engage children with sight, sound, read-along narration, touch and animation through interactive technology.
“If you are an African-American or Hispanic mother of young children you can seldom find children’s book that reflect your life, family and community, says Donna Beasley, Co-Founder and publisher. There is a void in the publishing industry for multicultural children’s books. In 2014 only 5% of children’s literature included children of color.  These few books are not nearly enough when you consider that 43% of students in our nation’s public school system are Black and Hispanic children and our country is growing more culturally diverse each year.
At KaZoom we believe every child should be able to find themselves and their community in the pages of a book. This lack of diversity in children’s literature creates a gap in the sense of self-love that comes from recognizing oneself in a text, from the understanding that your life and lives of people like you are worthy of being told, thought about, discussed and even celebrated.”
“The multicultural children’s book segment in the United States is one of the biggest untapped markets,” says Beasley.  KaZoom gives Kickstarter backers not only the opportunity to support a cause but also to become a character in a book or to tell their life story. I personally think it is pretty exciting to have a children’s book written around your life story or that of someone you love, don’t you think so?”

Minority Educational Tech Company Creates Interactive Digital Library of Multicultural eBooks For Kids
— KaZoom Kids Books iStory App Hailed as innovative tool for Sparking Interest in Reading for African-American and Latino Children —

Chicago, IL — Frustrated because she couldn’t find books that her six-year-old African-American niece could relate to and enjoy, a Chicago-based entrepreneur created a company featuring a library of ebooks whose storylines, characters and uplifting messages mirror the lives, families and communities of Black and Latino children. It is the first time in publishing history that a minority firm has created an interactive digital platform whose offerings are specifically written for multicultural children ages three to eight.







This interactive digital library of ebooks will be published by KaZoom Kids iStory Books, a division of KaZoom Digital Publishing. Award-winning marketer, Donna Beasley, is founder and president.
An official launch of the KaZoom Kids iStory Books digital platform will take place on July 16th. Billed as a subscription based service for children’s books, those interested in accessing the books can subscribe starting July 16, 2016 at their website www.KaZoomKidsBooks.com. The library features ten titles; two additional ebooks are offered per month.
According to Beasley, books that depict the multi-cultural experience allow kids of color an opportunity to see themselves reflected positively. Elaborating on the purpose of the company, Beasley said, “Our mission is to bring greater diversity to children’s literature. Our books will engage a child with read-along audio, sound, music, touch and animation.”
With the KaZoom Kids iStory App, each child can read the story or have the story read to them at the touch screen with words highlighted for the read-along option.
Filled with whimsical characters and illustrations that delight, and fascinate, the stories are fun but also touch on multiculturally-sensitive issues like black hair and single parenting. Other stories chronicle inspiring tales of successes.
Educators, parents and children are hailing the series for sparking an early love of reading and learning that could have lifelong benefits. Beasley says this is another positive by-product of the series. “The series helps improve a child’s reading skills by taking advantage of interactive technology,” she declares.
Vera Smith, a teacher at Miles Davis Magnet School, was shocked by the lack of diverse books for her students. Because of this, she often has to create her own materials. She says, “It is important for children to read stories with characters that look like them. It builds their self-esteem and lets them know they are not alone with things they struggle with like bullying. It also shows that they can overcome adversity. Like the characters, it gives them hope that they can achieve their dreams. I am super excited to become one of the first subscribers to KaZoom iStory Books.”
Mrs. Linda Jones, who was part of a focus group when the series was concept tested, said her eight-year-old daughter feels a connection to the characters and is drawn to them. As she reads the stories on the touch screen, she experiences a sense of glee and wonderment.
“Watching my daughter experience sheer joy is so uplifting and touching. She is transformed from being bored to being entertained, engaged, enchanted. We can’t wait for the launch so we can get current titles and the new offerings each month.”
The scarcity of books/ebooks that appeal to children of color is a disturbing reality that Beasley says is anchored in racism and in a failure to value black and brown children.
“If you are an African-American or Latino mother of young children you can seldom find children’s book that reflect your life, family and community,” notes Beasley. “There is a void in the publishing industry for multicultural children’s books. It is a startling fact that in 2014 only 5% of children’s literature included children of color. Yet our public school systems serve 40% black and Latino students. This is a similar demographic in urban centers nationwide.”
She sees the digital ebooks – and other similarly-inspired efforts – as part of a universal solution to the problem of children of color losing interest in school and experiencing failure in life.
A veteran marketer, Beasley drew from her vast experience in advertising, marketing and publishing to bring the company to life. Plying her years of creative contacts, she reached out to the Chicago community and asked for help to develop the books.
“Writers, illustrators and book designers of all ages and ability levels answered the call to make a difference in the diversity of children’s books. Over half of our ibooks are by first time authors. We take great pride in opening up this industry to new and diverse talent. Our goal is to make these books entertaining and enriching for our young readers. We are absolutely thrilled and delighted about this product launch. We believe every child should see themselves and their community in a book. Our books help children grow up proud.”

What is KaZoom Kids Books? 





KaZoom Kids Books is creating a digital library of interactive, multicultural children's books for ages 3 to 8. Our ibook apps will engage a child with read-along narration, music, animation, and interactive technology. Our goal is to make these books entertaining and enriching for our young readers and to encourage a love of reading.We believe our books build self-esteem by giving children the opportunity to see themselves in the story’s characters and then mirror the character's curiosity and courage. We believe every child should see themselves and their community in a book.





 Why KaZoom Kids Books?
If you are an African-American or Hispanic mother of young children you can seldom find children’s books that reflect your life, family and community. There is a void in the publishing industry for multicultural children’s books. It is a startling fact that 92% of children's literature does not include children of color.




 Of the 3,500 children’s books published in 2014, only 5% featured children of color.* Yet, both our public schools and our country are growing more culturally diverse each year. And, many of the most popular books for Black children available on Amazon today, were published 8 to 20 years ago.Who Writes and Illustrates Our Books?One of the challenges of creating multicultural kids books is that many of the interested talented writers and illustrators have not been able to get into the field of children's books. Because, major publishing houses don't publish these kinds of diverse books or hire multicultural writrers when they do.  Here is a surprising statistic, last year just 71 of the 278 (25.5%) children's books about African-Americans were actually written and/or illustrated by African Americans. At KaZoom we're opening our doors to talented writers across all multicultural communities.So we went out into the community and asked writers and artists to help us create greater diversity in children's books.  And many of them said yes. As a result, we are a company that is for the community and by the community.Why Diversity is Important in Children's Books:   -It helps a child to gain a better understanding of themselves.-Books are a powerful way for getting children to understand their family, neighborhood, and the world in which they live. -Multicultural books have been proven to have a positive development effect on children of all backgrounds.- Children can learn to respect other cultural groups, and even celebrate their
differences.
- Books by Black and Latino authors limit stereotype portrayals of characters and situations.Why we need your help? Help us create greater diversity in children’s literature. We need the funding in order to produce the best books we can.




 With your support, we will be able to:- finalize the production of our books which includes: hiring local writers and artists to illustrate books and hiring the interactive book designers, and recording of the read-along narration. - finalize our custom app, to incorporate both our library of books and the player, that allows customers to easily play our interactive books on their Android or Apple devices.Please help us continue producing high-quality books and enjoy a variety of cool backer rewards! What’s Inside Our Books?
Each book in the KaZoom Kids Digital Library consists of stories with full color pages, featuring children from diverse backgrounds:

solving problems, trying new things, and fearlessly exploring the world. Our books have read-along narration, interactive action and animation.




When kids have a healthy self-esteem, a sense of fearless possibility is inspired! The characters in KaZoom Kids Books are no different. They use self-esteem to give them courage to try new things, make new friends and barge into new adventures with a sense of wonder!




Our books help children enjoy reading by adding sound, motion, and animation to the stories in a fun and engaging way!
The beautiful artwork is accurate to multicultural communities, neighborhoods and experiences. The text is fun to read and easy to understand and each book has read-along narration which helps kids learn new words and phrases with ease.




 KaZoom Kids Books makes great stories accessible to all. You don't have to be a child of color to enjoy these books. Each story weaves narration, beautiful illustrations, and positive messages together to celebrate the power of differences and inclusion.




 Our Digital LibraryOur library allows children to engage with books in new ways. Our books have:

Great stories - that allows kids to engage with stories at their own pace and build a bigger vocabulary

Beautiful illustrations by talented artists

Read-a-long Narration  - that provides a fun way to build word and sound development and stimulate language skills
 

Interactive Books - that allows kids to engage with the characters in enjoyable stories they will love





The library gives kids the opportunity to use different sensory skills all at once to better comprehend and recognize new words and understand new ideas easily.Meet Our Amazing Team




Drawing from our collective 25 + years experience in publishing, advertising and mobile design development as well as our education, child-rearing, storytelling, art-making and corporate experience, you can trust us to bring you engaging, high-quality books with stories that are relevant long after the pages are closed. 



Risks and challenges
1. This is a large multiple book project
We are creating several books, which is more challenging than a single story.  We do however, have the best talented creative team to develop these beautiful books.  Donna is an experienced publisher who has solid experience producing multiple children’s book projects. The first books are near completion. We are confident that with this funding we can finalize and deliver the first 8 interactive digital books this summer.
2. Our books rely on technology
Our books rely on technology and sometimes technology can fail.  But our apps and digital library are on a secured, cloud platform for an easy, user friendly, customer experience.  Our library book app will be available in the both the Google Play and Apple iTunes stores.
3. "Telling Your Story" Perks includes Your Timing
The timing to deliver the, “Tell Your Story” perk is estimated.  It depends on your availability for the interview and the illustrator’s time to develop illustrations.  On average 6 months is sufficient time to complete your story.
Thank you so much in advance for helping us to create greater diversity in children’s books. You’re helping make a difference in the lives of thousands of children.
