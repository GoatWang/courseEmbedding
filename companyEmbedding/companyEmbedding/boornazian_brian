Review by Michale Franeo on 2016-02-03 



 Couch looks the alike as the photo. The essence has a scarcely bite of color variation, similar to a tweed. Cushions are attached (description stated detached). I wouldn't recommend positioning the couch in the middle of a room (not condemn a wall) due to it having sections of framework that velcro to the back of the couch. It could look a segment cheesy if you see the textile panels and sections of velcro. The couch is like others described, adamant but comfortable. After a team months of use the structure is starting to spread a nibble and doesn't look as taunt. Overall is the whole dovetail in the nook of our thumping derisory living room. Definitely a welfare buy!





Review by Joesph Vasques on 2017-03-01 



 Works goodly for the paltry hole I have. Color is logical as stated... kindly of gray, but yet excellence of blue. My only complaint is that there are no chairs that counterpart this.





Review by Krystle Slavik on 2016-10-27 



 Better than expected for the fee plus emancipate delivery. I highly recommend.





Review by Dee Economy on 2017-02-03
