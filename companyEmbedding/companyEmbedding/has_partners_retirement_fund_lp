How Risky Is Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.?
Three key metrics suggest that this MLP is fairly low risk, though those numbers alone don’t mean this investment is risk-free.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 18, 2017 at 10:35AM
            
            





Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) operates a relatively low-risk business model since the bulk of its earnings come from an extensive portfolio of fee-based pipelines and storage terminals. However, building that stable portfolio is just one of the steps the company has taken to keep risk at bay. Here's a closer look at how it stacks up against its peers and how its lower risk profile has helped the company overcome obstacles in the past so it could continue paying a growing distribution to investors.
Drilling down into the numbers
Three critical numbers for MLP investors are the percentage of cash flow underpinned by fees, the distribution coverage ratio, and the leverage ratio. Here's how Magellan Midstream Partners' metrics compare to several notable rivals:




Company


Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA


Current Distribution Coverage Ratio


% of Cash Flow Fee-Based or Regulated 






Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD)


4.3 times


1.2 times


93%




Magellan Midstream Partners


3.5 times


1.2 times


87%




Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA)


4.8 times


1.0 times


90%




Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ)


4.5 times


1.17 times


97%




Data source: Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, Plains All American Pipeline, and Williams Partners. 
As that chart shows, Magellan Midstream Partners has some of the most conservative metrics in its peer group. Its leverage ratio, for example, is well under 4.0 times, which is considered a safe zone for MLPs. Likewise, the company can currently cover its generous payout with room to spare since it has one of the highest coverage ratios in the group. Those two metrics, when combined with the fact that fee-based contracts underpin about 87% of its cash flow is why the company has one of the best credit ratings among MLPs, tied with Enterprise Products Partners.
That said, if there is one concern with those metrics, it's that fees only underpin 87% of cash flow, which is the lowest in the group. This factor has had an impact on the company in recent years. For example, last year distributable cash flow barely budged despite the completion of several growth projects. Meanwhile, the company was only able to reaffirm its guidance for 2017 even after securing a new contract for a recently completed project because the cash flow from that agreement would only offset the negative impact that weaker-than-expected commodity prices are having on earnings. However, with ample distribution coverage, the company has plenty of cushion to ensure that it can continue paying its distribution even if prices remain weak, which puts its payout on a much more sustainable footing than Plains All American Pipelines since it's just barely covering its distribution. Meanwhile, the company continues investing capital in building more fee-based assets that should further mute its direct exposure to commodity prices.

Risk mitigation in action
Magellan Midstream Partners' numbers suggest that it shouldn't have any problem maintaining its payout even if it runs into an unexpected issue. That has certainly been the case during the recent oil market downturn since it has been able to not only maintain its payout but has joined Enterprise Products Partners as one of the few MLPs that has continued growing its distribution. 
One reason Magellan has been able to do this is due to its top-notch balance sheet, which has proven to be a competitive advantage during the downturn because it has been able to access capital at a much cheaper rate than rivals. For example, Williams Partners had to offer a 7.85% interest rate to entice investors to buy the $1 billion of 10-year debt it was selling early last year when it needed cash for a looming debt maturity and to finance expansion. Meanwhile, Plains All American Pipeline had to offer an 8% yielding preferred to get the $1.5 billion it needed last year to fund expansion projects. Contrast those rates with the 5% that Magellan locked in when it offered $650 million of 10-year notes early last year so that it could refinance debt and fund growth projects.
Given their much higher capital costs, both Williams Partners and Plains All American Pipelines would go on to slash their payouts by double digits last year to shore up their financial situations. Meanwhile, because Magellan had no problem accessing the capital it needed, it was able to increase its payout by 10% last year and is on pace to grow it by 8% in 2017 and by the same rate in 2018. 





Investor takeaway
Magellan Midstream Partners boasts some of the most conservative financial metrics in its peer groups. Those have proven to be a crucial advantage in recent years because they've allowed the company to overcome several obstacles. That history demonstrates to investors that Magellan is a low-risk company that has the financial strength to make it through tough times.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P.: Buy the Dip?
After a big run leading into 2016, Enterprise Products Partners is off around 10% from its high. Should you be buying this dip?











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jun 20, 2017 at 11:18AM
            
            





Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is one of the largest oil and natural gas midstream partnerships in the country, and its shares have fallen roughly 10% since hitting a peak in February. Is it time for you to start adding this industry giant to your portfolio? The numbers say yes; here are six things you need to know before you pull the trigger.
1. Scale
Enterprise is one of the largest midstream companies in the United States. That means growth will be slower than at a smaller industry player, but it also means the partnership can take on deals and projects that not many of its peers could handle. So, scale has its advantages. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Enterprise is also one of the most diversified midstream names, partially a function of its size. It owns pipelines, storage facilities, products terminals, processing plants, and even a fleet of ships. It has assets spread across a huge swatch of the country. That means if one product it moves or regional area is under pressure, Enterprise has the flexibility to adjust its business to deal with the issue.  
2. Throughput, not commodities
The vast majority of Enterprise's business is fee-based. This point isn't unique to Enterprise. For example, Holly Energy Partners gets 100% of its revenues from fees. But it is still an important reason for owning Enterprise. Essentially, a fee-based business means that the price of oil and natural gas has a limited impact on Enterprise's business. Demand is a much more important determinant of success. 
To give you an idea of what this means, oil prices tumbled in mid-2014 and still hadn't fully recovered by year end 2016. But over that span, Enterprise's core distributable cash flow grew from $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. That's not amazing growth, but it happened at a time when oil prices fell from over $100 a barrel to around $30 at the worst point. Withstanding that kind of price drop highlights the value of Enterprise's business model... even if it isn't unique.

3. Buying growth
Another benefit of Enterprise's size is that it allows the midstream giant to make big moves in down markets. For example, it completed the acquisition of its oil tankers business in early 2015 while oil prices were still falling. And more recently it bought the midstream assets of Azure Midstream Partners at a bankruptcy auction. Both show Enterprise's ability to expand its business opportunistically in downturns so it can come out the other side a stronger company. 
Of course downturns aren't the only time it expands this way. But the ability to take a contrarian stance is a key differentiating factor. That said, to give you a broader sense of the company's history, Enterprise has spent $26 billion on acquisitions since its initial public offering in 1998. 
4. A builder
While acquisitions are an important piece of the growth equation for Enterprise, it isn't the only thing to watch. Construction is another key avenue for growth. On that front, the partnership has $8.4 billion of growth projects in the works between now and 2019.  

Enterprise is building its business from the ground up. Image Source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. IMAGE: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NjczMTU0fENoaWxkSUQ9MzgwOTQ1fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1 page 33

Size is important here, too, because Enterprise can comfortably take on projects that smaller peers don't have the scale to get done. In fact, Enterprise has spent around $38 billion on organic growth projects since it came public, far more than it's spent on acquisitions.  





5. Good quarter
That said, you might be asking what's going on today at Enterprise... Motley Fool's Tyler Crowe recently highlighted the good news here. In the first quarter, Enterprise saw nice jumps in net income, earnings, and distributable cash flow year over year and sequentially compared to the fourth quarter. All three had been in something of a holding pattern during the oil downturn, with new assets offsetting slow demand for existing assets.  
With drilling activity picking up in the United States, however, Enterprise's expansion efforts are really starting to show results. Assuming this trend continues the partnership should have a pretty good year.
6. Distribution
All of this leads to a discussion of the partnership's distribution, which is likely what attracted you to Enterprise in the first place. For starters, it offers a robust 6.2% distribution yield. That's toward the high end of its historical range. The distribution was covered by 1.3 times in the first quarter, which provides plenty of safety and room for future increases.  
Note that the distribution was increased by 5% in the quarter, marking the 51st consecutive quarter in which Enterprise has upped the disbursement. However, the longer streak is 20 -- the number of consecutive years that Enterprise has increased its distribution. If you like dividend increases, Enterprise has you covered.  





Would there be a bad time to buy?
All in, Enterprise is likely among the best-run participants in the oil and natural gas midstream industry. In fact, some might argue that there's never a bad time to buy this limited partnership for long-term investors seeking income (that's hyperbole, of course). But today, after a 10% pullback, is certainly not a bad time. With a well-covered 6.2% distribution yield and two decades worth of dividend growth behind it, investors would be well served to do a deep dive here.

About The Program


OUR HISTORY


Recognizing a need in the legal community
 In 1963 the American Bar Association created the Program because it recognized that the legal community could benefit from a unique type of retirement plan to meet its needs. In the past, partnerships did not have the same access to tax-deferred retirement plan benefits as they do today. The Program was created in part to allow, under a Collective Trust structure, partnerships and small law firms to access these benefits. Over time, the Program developed into a comprehensive and affordable retirement plan that, today, serves nearly 3,900 member law firm plans and more than 36,000 participants (as of December 31, 2016).



OUR VALUE PROPOSITION


Delivering valuable benefits to law firms
The ABA Retirement Funds Program is designed to provide unique, full-service 401(k) plans to the legal community. By leveraging its size, the Program brings together thousands of law firm retirement plans to offer a fund menu and service package typically available to only the largest of corporate retirement plans. This leverage allows the Program to bundle some of the largest and best known financial services providers in the industry.

Church Plans ERISA Litigation
Systemic Employee Benefit Denial

Keller Rohrback is one of America’s leading law firms handling retirement and employee benefit plan litigation. The firm is committed to helping employees and retirees protect their retirement savings and other employment-related assets. Keller Rohrback attorneys represent employees and organizational groups in litigation and offer advice and counseling on a wide range of employee benefit issues.
Courts routinely praise the work of Keller Rohrback attorneys on nationally prominent ERISA cases.
Keller Rohrback is proud that experienced ERISA practitioners decided to call Keller Rohrback home.  In 2002, Ron Kilgard and Gary Gotto joined Keller Rohrback.  They brought to the firm a wealth of knowledge in breach of fiduciary duty cases, having successfully litigated one of the first ERISA company stock cases—the IKON 401(k) case.  Then in 2008, ERISA veteran David Preminger—who has been practicing ERISA since it was enacted in 1974—joined the firm.  And most recently, in 2015, Jeff Lewis—a long time leader of the employee benefits plaintiffs’ bar—became a member of Keller Rohrback.
ERISA Litigation
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) sets minimum standards for the management of employer-sponsored retirement and health benefit plans. Workers and retirees across America depend on their company-sponsored benefit plans to provide them with health insurance and financial security after retirement. Keller Rohrback is recognized as one of the premier firms litigating ERISA breach of fiduciary duty claims against employers for losses to defined contribution plans caused by imprudent investment in company stock. In addition, Keller Rohrback attorneys have extensive experience litigating cases involving excessive fees related to the management and administration of plan investment funds (including mutual funds), conversions to cash balance plans, benefits due under defined benefit pension plans, and church plan litigation.
ESOP Litigation
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) is a tax-qualified defined contribution employee benefit program intended to invest primarily in the stock of the plan sponsor company. Both private and public companies offer ESOPs.
Keller Rohrback’s private ESOP practice focuses on business practices and fiduciary conduct in ESOP-owned companies. Firm attorneys are very familiar with applicable ESOP stock valuation techniques and work closely with valuation experts.
Learn more about Keller Rohrback’s ESOP practice here.
Health Care Benefit Issues
In addition to retirement plans, ERISA also governs how employee health care plans are administered. Health care plans must be operated according to particular standards that are designed to protect the interests of employees, retirees, and other plan beneficiaries, such as family members.
ERISA creates fiduciary responsibilities for those who manage and control health plans, requires that plans provide participants with accurate plan information, and gives plan participants the right to sue for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty.
Speaking Engagements and Publications by Keller Rohrback Attorneys
Based on Keller Rohrback’s extensive ERISA experience, our attorneys are frequently invited to speak at ERISA continuing legal education seminars and conferences. Additionally, Keller Rohrback attorneys have written numerous ERISA-related amicus briefs and articles.  Examples of speaking engagements, articles and amicus briefs by Keller Rohrback attorneys include:
