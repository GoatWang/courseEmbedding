ESG Investing


Environmental, Social and Governance
Socially Responsible Investing
As a United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) signatory, Fisher Investments considers environmental, social and governance issues in the investment and portfolio construction process. Further, we regularly screen and tailor our investment approach for separately managed accounts depending on any particular social and environmental guideline mandated by the client.
ESG/SRI Screens and FI’s Investment and Portfolio Construction Process
As part of the investment process, we evaluate the risk ESG issues may present to stock performance. We evaluate ESG issues on a case-by-case basis, and are willing to consider the potential impact of all types of ESG concerns. In particular, we routinely evaluate a range of governance issues and off balance sheet risks as part of our security selection analysis. These include consideration of a company’s auditors and whether their opinions are qualified or they have potential conflicts of interest, shareholder concentration, review of regulatory filings, and review of news flow from a wide range of sources for potential ESG concerns. Further, our ongoing analysis of global political drivers can influence security selection tied to potential political or regulatory risks companies face surrounding ESG issues. In situations where we believe any ESG issues present an inordinate risk to a company’s operational or financial performance, or is we believe it presents undue headline risk (where negative sentiment over the issue could present material headwind to performance), we would typically choose not to invest in that company.
Fisher Investments also regularly accommodates a range of client-mandated or requested ESG/SRI restrictions for their portfolio. Alternatively, we can oversee and determine the stocks to be restricted from purchase based on our interpretation of the socially responsible goals defined by the client. For clients with separate accounts in socially responsible or ESG mandates, the Investment Policy Committee (IPC), in conjunction with the firm’s Research Analysts, screens each security to determine whether it meets the client’s specific guidelines. This may include further analysis of the non-financial qualities of a company, such as determining if its strategic attributes and the economic/political drivers are in line with socially responsible guidelines and/or ESG principles. Fisher Investments’ Research Department has access to tools such as MSCI ESG Research to help determine a company’s suitability within a socially responsible or ESG portfolio. However, in some cases our interpretations may differ from the client’s interpretation on a security-by-security basis. If an investment’s validity during initial implementation and beyond raised any questions, additional dialogue would occur between the firm and client to help ensure compliance.
When a proactive IPC decision or client restriction causes the exclusion of a candidate security from purchase tied to ESG issues, the IPC would seek to find an appropriate replacement ot fill the intended role in the portfolio. This may involve adding a new replacement security and/or adding weight to existing positions. In most cases, the IPC is generally able to use alternate or replacement securities to replicate the desired top-down or thematic market exposure of candidate excluded for ESG reasons. As such, we typically do not expect ESG restrictions to materially impact expected risk or return characteristics of the strategy. 
ESG/SRI Sources of Information
Throughout the research process, we use various databases and information vendors to collect macroeconomic and company-specific data efficiently. Assisting with environmental, social and corporate governance issues, we subscribe to MSCI ESG Research as it provides specific social and environmental screening capabilities to our Research Department. In combination with readily available public information from our ongoing analysis of holding and portfolio candidates, we are generally able to accommodate socially responsible and ESG client-mandated guidelines in separate accounts while adhering to our overall investment strategy.
ESG/SRI History
Fisher Investments is a UNPRI signatory and has been managing account with various thresholds of environmental and social mandates for nearly two decades. Over that time, we have been able to satisfy our clients’ environmentally and socially responsible mandates without compromising our broader market outlook and themes. Fisher Investments manages billions of dollars for various clients with religious, environmental and/or socially responsible restrictions without adversely affecting our themes or performance.

Fisher Investments’ Background
Fisher Investments’ Background

Ken Fisher founded Fisher
Investments as a sole proprietorship in 1979, acting on his fundamental belief
in capitalism. Since inception, Fisher Investments has made significant
contributions to several areas of investment management through its original research
and development of capital markets technology.

In the 1970s, Ken Fisher pioneered
the use of the Price-to-Sales Ratio and detailed its relevance as a tool for
investment analysis. Later, this tool was used to help manage small
capitalization portfolios for institutional investors. In the mid-1980s, the
firm contributed to the delineation of the small cap value equity asset class
and explained its relevance to investors.

In 1984, Ken Fisher began writing
the monthly “Portfolio Strategy” column for Forbes magazine. His
prestigious Forbes “Portfolio Strategy” column ran from 1984 to 2017, making
Ken the longest continuously running columnist in the magazine’s history. He
continues to write regular columns for the UK’s Financial Times and Germany’s
Focus Money. Ken has written 11 books, including four New York Times
bestsellers.

In the early 1990s, Fisher
Investments contributed to the recognition of distinct investment styles and
cycles and conducted proprietary research aimed at identifying the drivers of
these cycles. These advancements became the foundation for a series of broad
equity mandate strategies: Global Total Return, US Total Return and Foreign
Equity.

Later that decade, the firm began
making significant developments in the emerging field of behavioral finance by
researching its practical application in the portfolio management process.

In 1995, Fisher Investments began offering
global equity management directly to high net worth individuals via the Fisher
Investments Private Client Group. In early 2000, the firm expanded its service
offerings to investors in both Canada and the United Kingdom. In 2007, the firm
entered into a joint venture partnership through its joint venture affiliate
(now a wholly owned subsidiary), Grüner Fisher Investments GmbH, which serves
investors in Germany.
Fisher Investments Structure
Fisher Investments manages assets across four principal business units – Fisher Investments Institutional Group (FIIG), Fisher Investments Private Client Group (FIPCG), Foreign Private Client Group (FPCG), and Fisher Investments 401(k) Solutions Group (401(k) Solutions). Together, these groups serve a global client base of diverse investors including corporate, public and multi-employer pension funds, foundations and endowments, insurance companies, healthcare organizations, governments and high net worth individuals.
While some key functions serve both business units, such as research, trading and investment operations, other functions are specialized, including private client acquisitions, private client services, and institutional, to name a few. Each business function is overseen by an Executive Vice President, who is responsible for ensuring the ultimate success of the business unit.

Together, Ken Fisher, Jeff Silk, Bill Glaser, and Aaron Anderson make up the Investment Policy Committee (IPC) at Fisher Investments. The IPC, directly supported by Fisher Investments' dedicated team of research analysts, makes strategic investment decisions for both institutional and private client portfolios.



Within the Fisher Investments Institutional Group, the client service and marketing roles are carried out by the firm's Portfolio Specialists, who serve as liaison between the IPC and our institutional clients and consultants. Their principle functions include servicing institutional clients and marketing to consultants and plan sponsors. The Portfolio Specialist role encompasses a variety of responsibilities including communicating portfolio strategy, market outlook, and performance. Additionally, Portfolio Specialists work with institutional clients and the Research Department to conduct independent research projects.

Expanded 2016 US Election Commentary

Topic: US, 11/9/2016

The voters have spoken and Donald Trump will be America’s next President. The Republicans will keep both houses of Congress, losing only a handful of seats. S&P 500 futures plunged in overnight trading, but short-term volatility is normal and US markets have since stabilized, closing the day after elections in positive territory. Markets move most on the gap between reality and expectations. People fear Trump’s campaign pledges, but politicians’ promises rarely become reality.


Brexit – Initial Market Commentary

Topic: Europe, 6/29/2016

The British people have officially voted to leave the European Union (EU). While Scotland, Northern Ireland and London supported remaining in the EU, Wales and the remainder of England overwhelmingly voted to leave. At final tally, 52% voted “Leave” versus 48% “Remain”. This piece breaks down the intricacies of the Brexit decision and analyzes the variables behind the uncertainty clouding the markets.


Retail Recession Label Does Not Fit

Topic: US, 5/26/2016

In the Q1 2016 earnings season, some department stores reported weaker-than-expected results with news of declining sales and profits. Media was quick to dramatize the reports with cries of a US “retail recession” and assertions that the consumer is tapped out —all bad signs for US growth looking forward. However, in this piece, we would humbly suggest that is incorrect.


Brexit – Potential Market Impact

Topic: Europe, 5/20/2016

On June 23rd, a public referendum will decide whether the United Kingdom remains in the European Union (EU). Britain’s possible exit from the EU, popularly named “Brexit”, has been the subject of heated debate with a number of high profile supporters on either side. This piece examines the likelihood of Brexit discusses potential implications for equity markets.


FI on False Fears

Topic: Emerging Markets, 3/28/2016

An in-depth analysis that debunks prevailing fears around China’s Debt & GDP growth, US oil industry debt, and the Fed’s balance sheet.


EM Corporate Debt

Topic: Emerging Markets, 2/18/2016

A summarized analysis that puts EM corporate debt into perspective and reveals the portion denominated in USD.


How Real is China's GDP?

Topic: Emerging Markets, 10/23/2015

Chinese GDP beat expectations in Q3, growing 6.9% y/y--the country's lowest growth rate since 2009. While this figure exceeded the financial media's expectations, it also spawned questions regarding its accuracy, and the reliability of Chinese data in general.


Will the UK's Referendum Impact Markets?

Topic: Europe, 10/22/2015

By the close of 2017, the United Kingdom (UK) is scheduled to hold a referendum on whether or not to stay a member of the European Union (EU). While some expect the United Kingdom's European Union referendum to roil equity markets, we believe this is unlikely.


An Unfavorable Climate For Energy Stocks

Topic: US, 8/17/2015

After rebounding in June, West Texas Crude (WTI) began decreasing and in August reached a six-year low. Energy firms are depleting cash reserves. Their earnings and revenues are declining, and a few struggling firms are beginning to sell assets or enter bankruptcy. Despite contrary assertions, it is too early to bottom fish in Energy.


China's Devaluation of the Yuan

Topic: Emerging Markets, 8/12/2015

The Chinese government announced on August 11th that it raised the daily "fixing" on the yuan (renmimbi) relative to the dollar to Rmb 6.23, effectively depreciating the currency by 1.9%. The fixing was raised another 1.6% in August 12th. Headlines decried the action as the largest daily move on record, but that is a byproduct of the managed nature of the yuan--other major currencies can and do move 2% in a single day. Speculation of the motivation behind the move ranged from stimulus prompted by weak trade and credit data to political wrangling with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for inclusion as a Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
