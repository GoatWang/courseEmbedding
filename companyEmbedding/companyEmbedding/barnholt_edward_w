Fostering Business Growth with Breakthrough Innovation 
By Barnholt, Edward W

Article excerpt

At Hewlett-Packard, a long-term commitment to research, a supportive culture, and openness to innovation in all aspects of the business has led to unanticipated technology breakthroughs. 
OVERVIEW: Investors today put a higher value on companies that improve their bottom lines through revenue growth rather than through cost-cutting. With this increasing emphasis on growth, technology breakthroughs become crucial. At Hewlett-Packard, the key relationship promoting innovation and growth is the synergy between R&D and product development. The challenge is to maintain the freedom for discovery in R&D while balancing the company's business objectives. At HP these two functions work together to focus on key strengths, produce breakthrough technologies, introduce a steady stream of new products, and achieve high levels of growth while maintaining research independence. 
Five years ago, the Test and Measurement business-the oldest business in the Hewlett-Packard Company-was on its way to becoming obsolete. But we did not die, and we can attribute our current success in large part to our reemphasis on innovation. For us, that meant going far beyond product innovation. We had to innovate in our overall strategy and in every other aspect of our business. 
We looked for innovative ways to change our processes, our organization, our culture-and our products-so that we could not only survive in this fast-paced environment, but grow. 
In this article, I describe how the relationship between research and development and product development at HP has led to breakthrough technologies, and allowed us to achieve very high levels of growth. But first, some background on why growth strategies are so important: 
There are two ways for a business to sustain performance: either by cutting costs, or by growing. Many large companies today are not growing, but downsizing. The problem with downsizing, and other cost-cutting activities, is that they are mostly geared toward survival, not prosperity. Gertz and Baptista put it bluntly in their book, Grow To Be Great (Free Press, 1995): "Corporate anorexia is not a sensible way to get healthy." There are some very practical reasons for wanting your company to pursue a growth strategy. 
Benefits of Growth 
First, investors place a much higher value on companies that improve their bottom lines through revenue growth rather than through cost-cutting. As far as the stock market is concerned, a penny saved is not as valuable as a penny earned. Figure 1, developed by the Mercer Management Consulting Group, shows that the market value of companies with profitable growth is higher than those that achieve higher profits by cutting costs. 
Companies that generate new profits from growing revenues are building a profit machine that is capable of generating a future stream of profits. In the final analysis, it is the future stream of profits that investors are paying for. 
Another advantage of growth that is harder to measure has to do with employee morale. In an age in which knowledge and human inventiveness are more important than capital and physical labor, it doesn't pay to have demotivated employees. The "lifeboat mentality" at companies that have experienced repeated layoffs can severely affect productivity, and eventually, profits. For this reason, a recent study of 180 companies in the United States, also done by Mercer Management Consulting, shows that 94 percent of American executives consider growth a top priority. And the primary driver of growth is innovation. 
With an increasing emphasis on growth, reliance on technology breakthroughs will only increase. But it is not easy to be an innovator. A successful strategy of innovation is dependent on a number of things. First, you must have a corporate culture that fosters innovation and contribution. Hire good people; give them freedom to explore different opportunities; and make sure that their efforts are tied to a common vision and strategy. …
