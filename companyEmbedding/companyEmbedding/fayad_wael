Enumeral Appoints Wael Fayad as Chairman, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer






September 22, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:ENUM) (“Enumeral” or the 
      “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and 
      development of novel antibody-based immunotherapies to help the immune 
      system fight cancer and other diseases, today announced that Wael Fayad 
      has been appointed Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of 
      the Company, effective as of September 21, 2016.
    


      Mr. Fayad brings to Enumeral more than two decades of senior executive 
      and business development experience in the life sciences industry. From 
      2001 to 2014, Mr. Fayad held positions of increasing responsibility at 
      Forest Laboratories, Inc., most recently as Corporate Vice President, 
      Global Business Development. In that role, he was responsible for 
      business development and alliance management, including the 
      identification, assessment and negotiation of multiple business 
      opportunities. Mr. Fayad helped build and manage a broad network of 
      partnerships at Forest, and upon Forest’s acquisition by Actavis, Mr. 
      Fayad also assisted with the integration of the two companies. Mr. Fayad 
      was subsequently engaged in a number of entrepreneurial ventures, 
      including helping to launch V&C Pharmaceuticals, a start-up company 
      focusing on improving healthcare outcomes and reducing the total cost of 
      care. Mr. Fayad continues to serve on V&C Pharmaceuticals’ advisory 
      board. Prior to Forest, Mr. Fayad served in positions of increasing 
      responsibility at Schering-Plough and Novartis in the fields of sales, 
      marketing, and new product development. Mr. Fayad holds a B.S. in 
      biology from the American University of Beirut, and an M.B.A. from 
      Concordia University.
    

      In connection with Mr. Fayad’s appointment as Chairman, President, and 
      Chief Executive Officer, John J. Rydzewski stepped down as Enumeral’s 
      Executive Chairman and from the Company’s Board of Directors. Arthur H. 
      Tinkelenberg, Ph.D., Enumeral’s former President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, also stepped down from the Company’s Board of Directors.
    

      “I am very excited to join Enumeral, a company with distinguished 
      science in the fields of immuno-oncology and the immune response to 
      disease,” said Mr. Fayad. “I am especially encouraged by the progress 
      Enumeral has made in building and validating its platform and advancing 
      highly differentiated programs. I look forward to further harnessing the 
      power of Enumeral’s platform, and to accelerating the company’s 
      evolution to advance treatments that meet compelling patient needs in 
      cancer and other diseases.”
    

      “We are particularly pleased to have Wael lead Enumeral as Chairman and 
      Chief Executive Officer, and we thank Art and John for their many 
      contributions since the Company’s founding,” said Robert Van Nostrand, 
      the Company’s lead independent director. “We are now embarking on a new 
      chapter in Enumeral’s history as we seek to further advance the 
      Company’s core platform capabilities and antibody drug discovery 
      efforts.”
    

      “Wael is a life sciences industry veteran with a deep network of 
      commercial relationships that can help to unlock the value of Enumeral’s 
      platform,” said Allan Rothstein, a member of the Company’s Board of 
      Directors. “Wael clearly recognizes our company’s potential, which 
      itself is further validation of what we have built at Enumeral.”
    

About Enumeral


      Enumeral is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and 
      developing novel antibody-based immunotherapies to help the immune 
      system fight cancer and other diseases. The Company is building a 
      pipeline focused on next-generation checkpoint modulators, with initial 
      targets including PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3, OX40, TIGIT, and VISTA. In 
      developing these molecules, Enumeral’s researchers apply a proprietary 
      immune profiling technology platform that measures functioning of the 
      human immune system at the level of individual cells. This provides key 
      insights for drug candidate selection and target validation. For more

 Educational Background



 


American University of Beirut

                  The American University of Beirut is a private, secular, and independent university in Beirut, Lebanon. Degrees awarded at the American University of Beirut (AUB) are officially registered with the New York Board of Regents. On April 24, 1863, the State of New York granted a charter for the Syrian Protestant College. The college, which was renamed the American University of Beirut in 1920, opened on December 3, 1866.                




 


Concordia University

                  Those who want options in their higher learning experience might find
Concordia University (CU) in Portland, Oregon a great choice for college.
CU students are given the flexibility to learn in a campus classroom
environment, on the internet, or in study abroad programs.

The school presents credit for short (two weeks) and long-term (one year)
academic experiences on most continents around the world. This is a great
way for students to become worldly and gain knowledge of different
cultures.

CU is a smaller, private, Christian university. They offer students
access to bible review groups, campus church services, and religious
retreats. The school has undergraduate and graduate programs in Exercise
and Sport Science, Nursing, and Social Work. They also have the same type
of academic degree programs online for those who want to pursue degrees
in areas such as Theological Studies, Teaching, and Business
Administration.

The university can provide monetary assistance to those who qualify, and
they extend a special offer to students. Those who completely fill out
the FAFSA forms can earn $1,000 or some other type of financial aid from
the school just for applying. Most of the population at CU is receiving
some type of financial support.

If you are looking for variety in your academic experience in a Christian
college environment, Concordia University might be the right place for
you.
