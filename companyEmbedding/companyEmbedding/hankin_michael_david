Sinful indeed! This wickedly delicious Zin is temptation at first sip. And that’s not just our pride talking... blame it on the Catholic school upbringing of brothers Michael and David or their lust for hedonistically seductive wine. Our flagship Old Vine Zinfandel hails from the enviable Lodi Appellation where Zin reigns supreme. Here for six generations, we’ve given our souls to growing the finest grapes so that saints and sinners alike can enjoy the 7 Deadly Zins.

Wine Profile

Tasting Notes
A little pepper, spice, and plenty of candied red berry fruit opens up the nose of our 2014 7 Deadly Zins. Full and rich with flavors of black cherry, currants, olive tapenade and exotic spices are rounded out with toasted oak notes on a lengthy finish.


Food Pairing Notes
This wine opens up beautifully when paired with food, especially a juicy tri-tip sandwich.

My favorite wine. Do I detect a hint of cinnamon? 







C.b.fortier







(Dec 24, 2016 at 7:16 PM)
We go out of our way to buy michael david wines.  Bought a case of this and now regretting it after opening a  bottle. it's flat with one dimensional finish.  there is also a slight bitterness. I gave 2 bottles to some friends for christmas.  Now i'm regretting it. 







Alexander Pokryvailo







(Dec 30, 2016 at 9:23 AM)
I have been buying this wine for 10 years, never regretted it. Rich, full taste. Never came across a spoiled bottle. Worth its money. 







Lothar Durktle







(Jan 24, 2017 at 10:09 PM)
I usually hate Zinfandel. This was the best Zinfandel I've ever had. 2013 vintage. 







Terry Pearson







(Mar 13, 2017 at 6:50 PM)
The other day I was browsing the wine shelves at my local Walgreens and noticed a bottle of Seven Deadly Zins, vintage 2007. (I know!! Surely it got overlooked at the back of the display.) It was with the 2014s and marked  $14.99. Must be some mistake, says I. So I checked with a clerk; no mistake, she tells me: $14.99. So I brought it home and we had it night before last with a London broil that I had marinated all day and grilled to medium rare. Ambrosia! 







David







(Apr 4, 2017 at 5:23 PM)
Usually like this wine but this bottle I bought from Costco is a 2014 and it's terrible. Wondering if all 2014 is bad. 







Karen







(Apr 5, 2017 at 7:06 AM)
Terrible bottle. I've been drinking 7 deadly zins for years. This 2014 bottle is bad. It burns like vinegar and gave me an upset stomach and heartburn. 







Andrew







(Apr 25, 2017 at 6:55 PM)
I really liked this! Great value for the price. I like their Freak Show Cab and Petit Peti a lot so i went by their reputation. 







Tom







(Apr 29, 2017 at 5:58 PM)
My wife and I have been big fans of 7 Deadly Zins for several years now.  It’s delicious, our go-to zin, and is amazingly versatile — pairs seamlessly with any number of strong-flavored dishes from steak au poivre to the hoisin-based pork barbecue we enjoyed tonight (with a 2014 vintage).  They've sold us a lot of wine, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon, as long as they keep up such great work!    
And in case you’re wondering, the clever name drew us in initially, but it’s the quality that keeps us coming back... 







George Pallas







(Jun 12, 2017 at 5:31 PM)
Great wine!  Those who claim no flavor and just alcohol have just opened a wine that has Bottleshock.  Bottleshock can last up to 6 months and effects newly released wines the most as well as wines older than 10 years.  Bottle shock can occur just from tipping wine from being on its side for awhile to upright to open.  That is why I let a bottle rest right side up for 2 weeks at least before opening. 







Michael







(Jul 28, 2017 at 9:46 AM)
This was my favorite for years . I recently bought a case and have had seven terrible bottles so far . There is a problem with the the 2014 . I have ordered this wine at restaurants with the same results so it's not just my case . The last time I decided to order a taste from a new bottle the waitress told me they are getting a lot of complaints and it's not same as it used to be . Obviously there is a problem with the 2014 I definitely do not recommend.
