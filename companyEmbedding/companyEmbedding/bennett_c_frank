ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS TARGETING APOLIPOPROTEIN E RECEPTOR 2



Publication number:  20170191066
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention provides compounds comprising oligonucleotides complementary to an LRP8 transcript. Certain such compounds are useful for hybridizing to an LRP8 transcript, including but not limited, to an LRP8 transcript in a cell. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in modulation of splicing of the LRP8 transcript. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in an increase in inclusion of exon 19 in the LRP8 mRNA transcript. In certain embodiments, such compounds are used to treat Alzheimer's Disease.

Compounds and methods for modulating interaction between proteins and target nucleic acids



Patent number:  9518259
                                            

Abstract:  Provided herein are antisense compounds and methods for recruiting one or more non-cleaving protein to a target nucleic acid in a cell. In certain instances such recruitment of a non-cleaving protein alters the function or activity of the target nucleic acid. In certain such instances, the target nucleic acid a pre-mRNA and the recruitment of the non-cleaving protein results in a change in splicing of the pre-mRNA.

METHODS FOR MODULATING TAU EXPRESSION FOR REDUCING SEIZURE AND MODIFYING A NEURODEGENERATIVE SYNDROME



Publication number:  20150275205
                                            

Abstract:  Disclosed herein are methods for reducing expression of Tau mRNA and protein in an animal with Tau antisense compounds. Also disclosed are methods for modulating splicing of Tau mRNA in an animal with Tau antisense compounds. Such methods are useful to treat, prevent, or ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases in an individual in need thereof. Examples of neurodegenerative diseases that can be treated, prevented, and ameliorated with the administration Tau antisense oligonucleotides include Alzheimer's Disease, Fronto-temporal Dementia (FTD), FTDP-17, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Epilepsy, and Dravet's Syndrome.

ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND USES THEREOF



Publication number:  20150275211
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention provides compounds comprising oligonucleotides complementary to a pyruvate kinase M transcript. Certain such compounds are useful for hybridizing to a pyruvate kinase M transcript, including but not limited to a pyruvate kinase M transcript in a cell. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in modulation of splicing of the pyruvate kinase M transcript. In certain embodiments, such compounds are used to treat one or more symptoms associated with cancer.

Profile



This sliver of a bar seems fashioned
for close encounters, from the velvety
dark-blue banquettes to the mirrored
back bar that allows for covert
touch-ups while waiting for your
date to arrive. But the most obvious
nod to intimacy are the call buttons
at every table, guaranteeing that you
won’t be disturbed unless you want
to be. (They’re a staple of Yves Jadot,
Alberto Benenati, and cocktail guru
Meaghan Dorman’s other bars, Dear
Irving and Raines Law Room.) Not
since Weather Up has there been a
low-lit boîte so worthy of a date night
in Tribeca, an area full of restaurantbar
hybrids and see-and-be-seen
spots. The Bennett even has romance
built into the menu: The Frank of
America ($15), a rye-and-spicedmaple
ode to Dorman’s boyfriend.
