Former Fashion Executive Charcy Evers Sizes Up the Industry With a Critical Eye

Think Tank: Is AI the Future of E-commerce Fraud Prevention?










Two weeks ago, Macy’s in the South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Calif., had a surprise visitor: the company’s top executive.

“I don’t tell anyone I’m coming. I call the store manager five minutes before I get there,” Terry J. Lundgren, Macy’s Inc. chairman and chief executive officer, told WWD.
This story first appeared in the December 19, 2014 issue of WWD.  Subscribe Today.
It could have been a kind of homecoming, considering that, as a young executive, Lundgren managed the store from 1981 to 1983, when it was a Bullock’s unit. He gets credit for bringing sizzle back to Macy’s selling floors and restoring confidence in the sector, and he likes the attention and prestige that comes with running America’s largest department store. But Lundgren’s objective at South Coast Plaza is to experience the store like any ordinary customer would, without it being gussied up for his arrival, and to focus on fundamentals.

“It’s the statement the store is making — what stands out, product-wise, brand-wise. Are the associates interacting with customers? Cleanliness. What’s South Coast Plaza got that’s unique?” he said.
He saw what he wanted to see: beefed-up accessories and dress areas and a new 3,000-square-foot skate-and-surf format that flows organically into activewear. They are by-products of Lundgren’s “My Macy’s” localization program, which tailors the merchandising to meet local needs, a tactic he has long touted as critical to finessing the assortments and generating comp-store sales gains.
Still, changes like the skate-and-surf shop don’t come together overnight. “It took a year to get it, but we made it impactful. It’s also in our other Southern California stores, 25 of them, and in the Hawaii stores, with brands like Quiksilver, Roxy and a lot of niche brands,” Lundgren said. “It’s easily transferable to many of our stores. We could do skate-and-surf in a lot of places in the summer and year-round in warm-weather cities.”
The surf-and-skate shops are further evidence of the continual flow of change at the $28 billion, 841-store Macy’s chain. That belies the popular perception of department stores as tired and slow to adapt, even marked for extinction. Lundgren’s not buying that argument. “We can never sit still,” he said. “We are always a little on edge. We are always slightly unsatisfied. If we have made progress, it’s about how do we take it to the next level.”
Throughout 2014, Macy’s has outpaced the competition. For steering the retail behemoth through a progressive year despite the odds, Lundgren is WWD’s Newsmaker of the Year.
His accomplishments include fulfilling omnichannel initiatives, locking in a site for Macy’s first overseas store, elevating a new generation of leaders, and effectively managing inventories and expenses amid a tough selling environment, all while raising the curtain on the dramatically renovated women’s and men’s departments at Herald Square.See the Top 12 Stories From the Year in Fashion Here >>  
“It’s been an unusual year in terms of the changes we made to build the business to last,” Lundgren noted. “There were so many things that fell in place or that we got in motion.…‘Buy online, pick up in store’ is one of the best and most creative innovations we’ve ever had. We began it two years ago, in the Washington market.” Now, it has been rolled out to all Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores. “If you are operating a specialty store, it’s easy. It’s not so easy in a 200,000-square-foot, three-level Macy’s. You have to be organized,” with the stores linking up to dot.com, products having to be plucked from the shelves or delivered from the distribution center, associates having to adjust what they do and the stores needing to create pickup areas.
When customers come to the store to pick up their orders, chances are they’ll buy more — 20 percent more than the online transaction, Macy’s calculates. “It’s called ‘radiated’ sales. That’s important,” Lundgren said. It’s also a sign that impulse shopping, despite reports to the contrary, is “alive and well,” he said.
Also on the omni front, Macy’s rolled out Beacon technology, Apple Pay and RFID and began testing new handheld point-of-sale devices and tablets for product information and faster transactions. In a few markets, Macy’s is testing same-day deliveries and image-search technology, which enables shoppers to photograph an item they see anywhere and then view similar items on macys.com.
Abroad, plans were revealed to open Macy’s first and Bloomingdale’s second international store, both of which will be in Abu Dhabi, and reports emerged that Macy’s has its eye on China, possibly for a store. Lundgren has been there several times and, not too long ago, brought some of his lieutenants along, suggesting something was up. “I have nothing to say on China” was his answer — at this point.
On the home front, a big chunk of the four-year, $400 million renovation of the Herald Square flagship was finished with the unveiling of the women’s casual and bridge departments on the fourth floor, women’s activewear on eight and men’s clothing on five, as well as the lower-level men’s furnishings and accessories department. The main floor and shoes were previously renovated; leased luxury accessory shops, a new restaurant, a separate salad restaurant, a Juice Press and café were added.
Though some might disagree, Lundgren said the character of the flagship hasn’t been lost in the modernization process. “No, I think it gained,” he said. Some would like to see those old wooden escalators removed, but Lundgren regards them as a charming vestige, saying, “As long as I am here, we will never take them out. Our engineers wanted to because you can’t get replacement parts. I let them take out one, for the parts.”
Macy’s in downtown Brooklyn (the former Abraham & Straus flagship) could see a major overhaul, as well. Executives have been narrowing down the options, which include a sale-leaseback and redevelopment of the site. “We are taking Brooklyn very seriously. This is a fantastic market. It’s a 100-year-old property,” Lundgren said. “It’s not going to be the same kind of scale [as]Herald Square, but we don’t just want a paint and carpet job. We want to do something special. There is a lot of interest.”
There’s also talk about Macy’s doing a deal with Google or Apple on a wearable-tech initiative. “I can’t talk about that. There could be,” Lundgren said. Asked if he’s a believer in wearable tech, the ceo said, “It’s always going to be about what the customer finds to be important. It always starts at putting the customer at the center of the decision.”
In other maneuvers this year: 
■ A smaller Bloomingdale’s prototype, a potential growth vehicle nationally, opened in Stanford, Calif.
■ The world’s largest NFL Shop, a 36,000-square-foot pop-up, opened on the fourth floor of the Herald Square flagship to coincide with the Superbowl in New Jersey last February. 
■ Sustainability efforts gained steam, with more electric-vehicle charging stations and solar roofs installed and greater waste-reduction efforts.
■ Development of a Thalía Sodi private brand shifted into high gear for next spring’s launch. “It will be one of the most expansive launches in the history of Macy’s Merchandising Group,” Lundgren said.
■ Macy’s Millennial business, which seemed to be stalled for years, turned a corner “because of the product,” Lundgren said. “It started growing, particularly in the athletic business, athletic footwear, Lids and Maison Jules.”

Succession planning moved to the forefront: Jeffrey Gennette stepped up to corporate president while continuing as chief merchandising officer, and Tony Spring took the helm of Bloomingdale’s as chairman and ceo, succeeding Michael Gould.
“I’ve worked, personally, very hard on the subject of attracting and retaining the best talent,” Lundgren said. “We are recruiting 1,000 college students a year [and] getting incredibly talented young people. I can tell you, I don’t think there is any retailer in America hiring 1,000 college students a year. You hear about the old A&S training program, the old Bloomingdale’s training program. I can guarantee you that the old days were not nearly as good as what we’ve got now.”
Asked if he has identified backups for top executives such as Karen Hoguet, the chief financial officer; Martine Reardon, chief marketing officer; Kent Anderson, president of macys.com, and Peter Sachse, chief stores officer, Lundgren replied, “I can assure you I have every single position backed up with very talented people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. They’re in the pipeline.”
Lundgren has been Macy’s ceo since February 2003 and chairman and ceo since January 2004. Earlier, he was president, a title he also assumed in February 2003.
He began his career in 1975 as a trainee with Bullock’s, a division of Federated, which eventually was taken over by Macy’s. Over the next decade, he held positions of increasing responsibility in buying, store management, human resources and senior-level store management and merchandising slots. He joined Neiman Marcus as executive vice president but soon became chairman and ceo, then, in April 1994, returned to Federated as chairman and ceo of its merchandising group before rising to president and, ultimately, ceo.
The 62-year-old Lundgren doesn’t appear ready to retire from Macy’s, and there’s no pressure as long as the numbers continue to hold up. In the third quarter, Macy’s lifted its net earnings by 22.6 percent to $217 million, despite a 0.7 percent drop in comparable sales, including departments licensed to third parties. Macy’s stock has held firm, recently hovering around $62, on the high side of the 52-week range from $50.05 to $65.74.
Lundgren seems to relish his role and the benefits that come with it. While restoring the store’s luster, he makes no apology for Macy’s promotional posture, one of the industry’s most rigid. “Macy’s is a promotional department store. That’s who we are and will always be. The level of promoting this year is not dramatically different from last year or the year before and won’t be next year. We are clearly doing what the customer wants,” he said.
At 6 feet, 3 inches, and 180 pounds, he keeps fit and seems slimmer in his Armani suits. He works out three to five days a week with a trainer in a gym, doing weights, aerobics and yoga. Then there’s that disciplined diet. He noted, “I’m vegan until 7 p.m. on the weekdays,” with lots of protein shakes and cereal with almond milk on the menu. “It works for me. I’ve been the same weight for the past 10 years,” he claimed.
Lundgren also clearly burns energy on the job. “Staying up 36 hours straight on Black Friday was tough,” he admits. “The plus side is [that] I have been doing this for a while. I feel I can handle any physical stress. I think my instincts help me to do the job faster and effectively.” He’s got those piles of paper on his desk under control. “If it’s on my desk, I know exactly where it is. If I file it away, it’s unlikely I will ever look at it again. I know what’s in each pile,” he said.
The ceo is on the road every week, and he noted that the recent visit to Southern California was not just for the stores: There was also a dinner to honor Macy’s “five-star” suppliers to its private brands, and he mentioned the Chargers-Patriots football game. What helps him to sustain his drive are those “sight lines to the future,” knowing he’ll be going to the Sunday game or getting in some vacation.
“It’s always been a hard job. The wear and tear on the mind and the body is hard,” Lundgren said. “You have to have a certain resilience. There are always obstacles, complications. You have to have enough resilience to get through the tough days and stay focused on the vision. Every day something else pops up.” Like on Black Friday, when a crowd stormed the Herald Square flagship to protest decisions not to indict two police officers involved in the controversial deaths in Ferguson, Miss., and Staten Island, N.Y.
“Whenever there is an incident of any significance, I am notified immediately. It’s primarily an FYI.” In the case of the recent protest, “Herald Square security sent me a quick video,” he said. Pretty soon afterward, it was business as usual, so Lundgren saw no need to get involved in the highly charged situation. “They weren’t protesting Macy’s,” he said, observing that the protestors were using one of the world’s most famous retail settings as just a stage to broadcast their message.
Regarding another unexpected situation, Lundgren saw last month’s worker dispute at West Coast ports as a possible threat to holiday deliveries, so he became “personally involved,” communicating with President Obama’s office to help resolve the situation.
On the product front, one persistent challenge is women’s apparel, which accounts for 23 percent of Macy’s business. And that hasn’t made his job any easier. “There are pockets of apparel that are good — athletic, parts of the Millennial business, the dress business,” Lundgren said. “Women’s sportswear is hit or miss, by each brand. There hasn’t been an overall growth trend for apparel in a few years. I believe it will come back. It will, indeed, turn at some point. It’s cyclical. At some point, there will be pent-up demand. The business is just being eaten up. There are so many options.”
And too much sameness, as Lundgren implied. “Unique, exclusive or very limited merchandise — the key is to make that a larger and larger percent of the assortment,” he said.
Lundgren is expecting Q4 to show more life than Q3, with the weather outlook better than last year’s brutal cold spell, a more efficient flow of merchandise receipts, the benefits of “buy online, pick up in stores,” and Macy’s spending more on digital marketing and events. He’s sticking to his script, which is one of optimism for the future, and has refuted reports that Black Friday weekend was bad for the retail industry. Most irksome was the 11 percent drop reported by the National Retail Federation’s consumer survey. It didn’t sit right with Lundgren. “Black Friday is still the biggest day of the year for us,” he said. So, he called NRF president and ceo Matt Shay to disagree. “I had a conversation with Matt after all the reports came out. He wasn’t the least bit defensive,” Lundgren noted. “I just said it can’t be right.”

Early life[edit]
Terry J. Lundgren was born in 1952, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in 1974.[1]
Career[edit]
Through his career at Federated/Macy's, Lundgren is credited with being an innovator in merchandising, branding and localization. He was instrumental in developing the company's private brands of merchandise and led the 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and May Department Stores, Inc., creating one of the largest retailers in the world, with more than 800 U.S. stores and 2008 net sales of US$24.9 billion.[2]
Like all retailers, Macy's, Inc. saw declining sales in 2008 amid deterioration of the U.S. economy. In fiscal 2008 (through January 2009), same-store sales declined by 4.6% at Macy's, Inc. In this environment, however, Macy's, Inc. has outperformed virtually every major competitor.[3]
Macy's is seeing positive early results from "My Macy's", a localization initiative launched by Lundgren in spring 2008 to tailor a portion of every store's assortment to local tastes and color. The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model is being rolled out across the U.S. in 2009.[4]
As reported in Macy's, Inc.'s proxy statement filed in April 2009, Lundgren's total compensation in 2008 declined by 37% to $5.4 million, reflecting lower sales and profitability in a weak economy. His compensation included $1.5 million in salary, $900,000 under the non-equity incentive plan, and $496,423 in various other compensation. The remainder was the value of stock options.[citation needed]
Lundgren's salary and the composition of the Macy's Board of Directors was cited by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as an example of an overcompensated Chief Executive Officer. In a September 2015 television interview, Trump stated that the high salaries paid to CEOs was often a "joke" and a "disgrace", Trump cited Macy's, Inc. as an example.[5]
Lundgren has been awarded numerous honors. In 2008, he received the Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation,[6] considered the retailing industry's pre-eminent honor. In spring 2008, he was presented with Carnegie Hall's third annual Medal of Excellence for outstanding philanthropic leadership in the arts.[7] The gala held in Lundgren's honor raised $4.2 million for Carnegie Hall. Lundgren is very active in the community; he has been appointed Commissioner on Women's Economic Development by the Mayor of New York. Also, on behalf of NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg he served as one of the industry chairs of Fashion.NYC.2020,[8] which looked at the future of NYC's fashion industry and made recommendations for actionable steps the NYC government could take to promote NYC's fashion industry
He has been presented with several business recognition awards and has served as dinner chairman or as honoree for numerous retail industry organizations and charities, including the Fresh Air Fund, American Jewish Council, Breast Cancer Awareness, NOW Legal Defense, Parsons School and the Ovarian Cancer Society. Lundgren currently serves on the boards of Carnegie Hall, The New York City Partnership and United Way of New York City, as well as participating in numerous other charitable and civic efforts.[citation needed]
Lundgren is chairman of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.[9] He is on the membership committee of the Economic Club of New York[10] and is involved with the New York City Principal for a Day Program.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. After graduating college, he joined Federated and rose quickly to lead the upscale specialty Bullocks Wilshire division in Los Angeles at age 35. Lundgren was married to Nancy Cross until their divorce; he has two daughters from this marriage. Lundgren married Tina Stephan in 2006.[citation needed]
Lundgren is also the namesake of the Terry J. Lundgren Center for Retailing at the University of Arizona, where he is also an alumnus, having graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree. In 2000, Lundgren was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the university's commencement address.[12][13]

Early life[edit]
Terry J. Lundgren was born in 1952, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in 1974.[1]
Career[edit]
Through his career at Federated/Macy's, Lundgren is credited with being an innovator in merchandising, branding and localization. He was instrumental in developing the company's private brands of merchandise and led the 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and May Department Stores, Inc., creating one of the largest retailers in the world, with more than 800 U.S. stores and 2008 net sales of US$24.9 billion.[2]
Like all retailers, Macy's, Inc. saw declining sales in 2008 amid deterioration of the U.S. economy. In fiscal 2008 (through January 2009), same-store sales declined by 4.6% at Macy's, Inc. In this environment, however, Macy's, Inc. has outperformed virtually every major competitor.[3]
Macy's is seeing positive early results from "My Macy's", a localization initiative launched by Lundgren in spring 2008 to tailor a portion of every store's assortment to local tastes and color. The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model is being rolled out across the U.S. in 2009.[4]
As reported in Macy's, Inc.'s proxy statement filed in April 2009, Lundgren's total compensation in 2008 declined by 37% to $5.4 million, reflecting lower sales and profitability in a weak economy. His compensation included $1.5 million in salary, $900,000 under the non-equity incentive plan, and $496,423 in various other compensation. The remainder was the value of stock options.[citation needed]
Lundgren's salary and the composition of the Macy's Board of Directors was cited by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as an example of an overcompensated Chief Executive Officer. In a September 2015 television interview, Trump stated that the high salaries paid to CEOs was often a "joke" and a "disgrace", Trump cited Macy's, Inc. as an example.[5]
Lundgren has been awarded numerous honors. In 2008, he received the Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation,[6] considered the retailing industry's pre-eminent honor. In spring 2008, he was presented with Carnegie Hall's third annual Medal of Excellence for outstanding philanthropic leadership in the arts.[7] The gala held in Lundgren's honor raised $4.2 million for Carnegie Hall. Lundgren is very active in the community; he has been appointed Commissioner on Women's Economic Development by the Mayor of New York. Also, on behalf of NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg he served as one of the industry chairs of Fashion.NYC.2020,[8] which looked at the future of NYC's fashion industry and made recommendations for actionable steps the NYC government could take to promote NYC's fashion industry
He has been presented with several business recognition awards and has served as dinner chairman or as honoree for numerous retail industry organizations and charities, including the Fresh Air Fund, American Jewish Council, Breast Cancer Awareness, NOW Legal Defense, Parsons School and the Ovarian Cancer Society. Lundgren currently serves on the boards of Carnegie Hall, The New York City Partnership and United Way of New York City, as well as participating in numerous other charitable and civic efforts.[citation needed]
Lundgren is chairman of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.[9] He is on the membership committee of the Economic Club of New York[10] and is involved with the New York City Principal for a Day Program.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. After graduating college, he joined Federated and rose quickly to lead the upscale specialty Bullocks Wilshire division in Los Angeles at age 35. Lundgren was married to Nancy Cross until their divorce; he has two daughters from this marriage. Lundgren married Tina Stephan in 2006.[citation needed]
Lundgren is also the namesake of the Terry J. Lundgren Center for Retailing at the University of Arizona, where he is also an alumnus, having graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree. In 2000, Lundgren was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the university's commencement address.[12][13]

 Terry J. Lundgren 1952— Biography



      Terry J. Lundgren
      
      1952–
    











        Chairman, president, and CEO, Federated Department Stores
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1952.
    

      Education: University of Arizona, BA, 1974.
    

      Family: Married Nancy Lundgren (divorced); children: two.
    

      Career: Federated Department Stores, Bullock's division,
      1975–1987; Bullocks Wilshire, 1987, president; Neiman Marcus,
      1988–1994, chairman and CEO; Federated Merchandising Group,
      1994–1996, head; 1997–2001, chief merchandising officer;
      1997–, president; 2002, COO; 2003–, CEO; 2004–,
      chairman.
    

      Address: Federated Department Stores, 151 West 34th Street, New York, New
      York 10001; http://www.federated-fds.com.
    

      ■ In early 2004 Lundgren became the first executive in the 75-year
      history of Federated Department Stores to simultaneously hold the titles
      of chairman, president, and CEO. Previously, all three positions were held
      by separate people. Lund-gren earned a reputation as a visionary; he was
      one of the first executives in the business to call attention to the
      department store industry's dated image, citing change as a
      paramount strategy necessary for survival. In each of his positions he
      made an immediate impact, surprising industry insiders. By early 2004 he
      oversaw a $15.4 billion company that operated 460 stores in 34 states,
      Guam, and Puerto Rico. The fast-track executive, with his model good
      looks, was in over his head.
    

      LEARNING THE VALUE OF HARD WORK
    

      Tough breaks forced maturity upon Lundgren during his formative years. He
      was the only child out of six to attend college, mostly because his
      parents did not have the money. He joined a fraternity at University of
      Arizona and became president of his pledge class. But his grades were not
      good, and one day his father called with news that he would no longer pay

          . 
        


      for tuition. The 
      
        New York Times
      
       reported that his father said, "Your life is in your hands.
      It's entirely up to you and you'll figure it out"
      (December 14, 2003). After some initial sulking, Lundgren found employment
      cracking oysters and peeling shrimp at a local Tucson restaurant. He was
      eventually promoted to waiter, then headwaiter, and then head manager of
      the restaurant. He was proud of having paid his way through college and
      graduating without any debt. "That's when I figured out what
      my parents were telling me, and appreciated the life lesson."
    

      ON THE FAST TRACK
    

      Most of Lundgren's career was tied to Federated Department Stores.
      He first joined the Bullock's division in Los Angeles in 1975,
      rising to become president of the Bullocks Wilshire
       specialty operations in 1987. When Macy's purchased the
      Bullock's division from Federated in 1988, Lundgren jumped to
      Neiman Marcus. The CEO of Neiman left for Federated a few years later, and
      Lundgren was thrust into the CEO position at age 37. It was an inopportune
      time to take over, as Lundgren was charged with the task of leading the
      high-end chain through a recession.
    

      DEFYING THE CRITICS
    

      Industry insiders wondered whether the young executive had the industry
      know-how and experience to succeed. Stanley Marcus, the merchant whose
      grandfather was one of the founders of Neiman Marcus, bet Lundgren $100
      that he would miss sales targets. Marcus lost the bet. In fact, Neiman
      emerged from the recession stronger than many of its industry peers. The 
      
        New York Times
      
       reported that Stanley Marcus said, "I had the feeling that he
      needed a few more years of seasoning because his only experience was at
      Bullock's. I was wrong. He waded right in and didn't miss a
      beat" (November 10, 1994).
    

      REINVENTING THE DEPARTMENT STORE
    

      When Lundgren left for Federated Merchandising in 1994, he once again
      shocked the industry by making an immediate mark on the business. Shaking
      up the company's purchasing strategy, he shifted from
      central-buying teams, which controlled most of the company's
      decisions about what was sold in stores, to a more autonomous approach in
      which regional teams could decide what was best for their customers. The
      goal was to improve merchandising that often seemed sorely out of sync
      with its customers. Lundgren observed, for example, that a china pattern
      that appealed to those in the Midwest would flop with those on the East
      Coast.
    

      Lundgren's primary objective was to reinvent the department store,
      a business model that many saw as a dying breed. Key to this strategy was
      giving customers a product selection that they would not find anywhere
      else. In late 2003 only 23 percent of Federated's inventory was
      proprietary, including private brands, joint ventures, and exclusives from
      vendors. Lundgren hoped to increase the percentage of merchandise unique
      to Federated stores to about 50 percent. He introduced "H,"
      an upscale line of men's and women's sportswear from Tommy
      Hilfiger, which was sold only in Federated stores. He wanted to make
      shopping easier, so he borrowed the idea of shopping carts. The retail
      analyst Jeffrey Stein said in the 
      
        Daily News
      
       that the idea "may work, it may not. You don't know unless
      you try. Lundgren is trying to be proactive in turning around
      deficiencies. He's more proactive than his competitors"
      (July 28, 2003).
    

      AS FEDERATED GOES, SO GOES THE INDUSTRY
    

      A lot rested on Lundgren's mission to rescue the department store.
      In 2003 big chains like Federated accounted for just 11 percent of the
      nation's retail sales, down from about 20 percent in 1987. On Wall
      Street, the department-store sector hovered at the bottom of the retail
      pecking order, with companies such as Federated, Saks, and May Department
      Stores posting disappointing sales month after month. Lund-gren understood
      the challenge and did not back down. He said in a 
      
        Wall Street Journal
      
       report that "the problem isn't that no one is in our
      stores. We have plenty of traffic. The key is having the right product at
      the right price point in an environment that's different and
      easy" (July 8, 2003). While the out-come of Federated's
      future rested clearly in Lundgren's hands, rivals and skeptics
      understated him at their peril.

Macy’s longtime chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, will step down next year, the company announced on Thursday, as the retailer grapples with sagging sales and broader changes in the ways people shop.Jeff Gennette, 55, who is the company’s president, will take the top spot, while Mr. Lundgren will stay as executive chairman.“I have been honored to lead this enterprise through a period of unprecedented reinvention,” Mr. Lundgren said in a statement. “While our company is larger, stronger and more resourceful than we were 13 years ago, now is the time to reset our business model to thrive in a future that is being driven by rapid evolution in consumer preferences and shopping habits.”The company said the leadership transition was part of its board’s succession plan. But the moves come in the face of widespread turmoil at the nation’s department stores, including Macy’s, which have struggled to recover from the recession as quickly as the rest of the retail industry. Shoppers are spending more, but they are also hunting for bargains, online and at so-called off-price stores known foremost for their discounts.

Amazon, the online shopping giant, as well as discount chains like T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, have added to the pressure. Macy’s and other department stores have offered aggressive promotions to entice shoppers, a move that some retail experts say has led to a race to the bottom. Continue reading the main story

“We’re a promotional department store, and we will continue to be a promotional department store,” Mr. Gennette said in an interview. “We offer values every day to our customer.”Macy’s, J. C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl’s all reported surprisingly lackluster sales last quarter that sent their stocks tumbling. Macy’s was particularly hard-hit, reporting that sales at comparable stores, a measure often used by the industry, fell 5.6 percent over the previous year, the weakest showing since the recession.The new chief has a “very daunting task” ahead of him, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting and research firm.“Macy’s is facing some very difficult challenges,” Mr. Johnson said. “I think it’s the right move at the right time.”Still, the selection of Mr. Gennette does not seem to suggest a swift resetting of strategy. He said he expected to continue several of the initiatives begun under his predecessor. To better compete with discount stores, Macy’s is opening outlet stores under the Macy’s Backstage name and plans to have 15 of those stores open by the end of the fourth quarter.Mr. Gennette said he also wanted to continue building collaborations with other brands. In some stores, Macy’s leases space to Men’s Wearhouse to run a tuxedo rental business. It also has similar arrangements with Finish Line, the athletic shoe brand, and Sunglass Hut. These brands lease the space and operate separate shops within Macy’s stores.

He is also continuing what he calls Macy’s “I do” strategy, upgrading fine jewelry departments within the department stores.“We believe we can be the wedding destination,” he said. “It starts with the ring and goes all the way to your first house and kid. We believe we can be a one-stop shop for that.”

What’s not clear is how Mr. Gennette will differ from his predecessor, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino.Mr. Gennette began his career at Macy’s in 1983, starting as an executive trainee and working his way into management roles in the men’s and children’s divisions. Before his promotion to Macy’s president in 2014, he worked as the company’s chief merchandising officer since 2009.“He’s very much a Macy’s insider,” Mr. Saunders said. “He knows the business inside and out, and he’s worked very closely with Lundgren for many years. In a way, they’re just swapping seats.”Aside from its retail business, Macy’s is also exploring ways to raise money from its many real estate holdings. Last year, the company sold part of its building in Downtown Brooklyn to Tishman Speyer, a developer. The retailer will continue to occupy the first four floors of the nine-story building, while the upper floors will be reconfigured into office space for other tenants.Mr. Gennette said Macy’s was also pursuing other sales or joint ventures at its flagship stores in New York, Chicago and Minneapolis, as well as some of its mall properties.Mr. Lundgren, 64, who has led Macy’s since 2003, will step down as chief executive in the first quarter of 2017, the company said. He has transformed Macy’s during his tenure, including with a buyout of the May Department Stores Company in 2005. After the merger, he converted other local chains, like Marshall Field’s in Chicago and Filene’s in Boston, into Macy’s stores. He also changed the company’s corporate name to Macy’s from Federated Department Stores in 2007.Macy’s now operates 870 stores in 45 states, up from just 240 stores in 2005. Those stores include the upscale department store chain Bloomingdale’s and the makeup retailer Bluemercury. Macy’s shares rose about 2 percent in midday trading.“Under Lundgren, lots of different initiatives were going on. What Macy’s needs is a finisher of those things,” said Mr. Saunders, the retail analyst. “We have to see what Jeff Gennette can do.”

Early life[edit]
Terry J. Lundgren was born in 1952, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona in 1974.[1]
Career[edit]
Through his career at Federated/Macy's, Lundgren is credited with being an innovator in merchandising, branding and localization. He was instrumental in developing the company's private brands of merchandise and led the 2005 merger of Federated Department Stores, Inc. and May Department Stores, Inc., creating one of the largest retailers in the world, with more than 800 U.S. stores and 2008 net sales of US$24.9 billion.[2]
Like all retailers, Macy's, Inc. saw declining sales in 2008 amid deterioration of the U.S. economy. In fiscal 2008 (through January 2009), same-store sales declined by 4.6% at Macy's, Inc. In this environment, however, Macy's, Inc. has outperformed virtually every major competitor.[3]
Macy's is seeing positive early results from "My Macy's", a localization initiative launched by Lundgren in spring 2008 to tailor a portion of every store's assortment to local tastes and color. The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model is being rolled out across the U.S. in 2009.[4]
As reported in Macy's, Inc.'s proxy statement filed in April 2009, Lundgren's total compensation in 2008 declined by 37% to $5.4 million, reflecting lower sales and profitability in a weak economy. His compensation included $1.5 million in salary, $900,000 under the non-equity incentive plan, and $496,423 in various other compensation. The remainder was the value of stock options.[citation needed]
Lundgren's salary and the composition of the Macy's Board of Directors was cited by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as an example of an overcompensated Chief Executive Officer. In a September 2015 television interview, Trump stated that the high salaries paid to CEOs was often a "joke" and a "disgrace", Trump cited Macy's, Inc. as an example.[5]
Lundgren has been awarded numerous honors. In 2008, he received the Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation,[6] considered the retailing industry's pre-eminent honor. In spring 2008, he was presented with Carnegie Hall's third annual Medal of Excellence for outstanding philanthropic leadership in the arts.[7] The gala held in Lundgren's honor raised $4.2 million for Carnegie Hall. Lundgren is very active in the community; he has been appointed Commissioner on Women's Economic Development by the Mayor of New York. Also, on behalf of NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg he served as one of the industry chairs of Fashion.NYC.2020,[8] which looked at the future of NYC's fashion industry and made recommendations for actionable steps the NYC government could take to promote NYC's fashion industry
He has been presented with several business recognition awards and has served as dinner chairman or as honoree for numerous retail industry organizations and charities, including the Fresh Air Fund, American Jewish Council, Breast Cancer Awareness, NOW Legal Defense, Parsons School and the Ovarian Cancer Society. Lundgren currently serves on the boards of Carnegie Hall, The New York City Partnership and United Way of New York City, as well as participating in numerous other charitable and civic efforts.[citation needed]
Lundgren is chairman of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.[9] He is on the membership committee of the Economic Club of New York[10] and is involved with the New York City Principal for a Day Program.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. After graduating college, he joined Federated and rose quickly to lead the upscale specialty Bullocks Wilshire division in Los Angeles at age 35. Lundgren was married to Nancy Cross until their divorce; he has two daughters from this marriage. Lundgren married Tina Stephan in 2006.[citation needed]
Lundgren is also the namesake of the Terry J. Lundgren Center for Retailing at the University of Arizona, where he is also an alumnus, having graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree. In 2000, Lundgren was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the university's commencement address.[12][13]

Like all retailers, Macy's, Inc. saw declining sales in 2008 amid deterioration of the U.S. economy. In fiscal 2008 (through January 2009), same-store sales declined by 4.6% at Macy's, Inc. In this environment, however, Macy's, Inc. has outperformed virtually every major competitor.[3]
Macy's is seeing positive early results from "My Macy's", a localization initiative launched by Lundgren in spring 2008 to tailor a portion of every store's assortment to local tastes and color. The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model is being rolled out across the U.S. in 2009.[4]
As reported in Macy's, Inc.'s proxy statement filed in April 2009, Lundgren's total compensation in 2008 declined by 37% to $5.4 million, reflecting lower sales and profitability in a weak economy. His compensation included $1.5 million in salary, $900,000 under the non-equity incentive plan, and $496,423 in various other compensation. The remainder was the value of stock options.[citation needed]
Lundgren's salary and the composition of the Macy's Board of Directors was cited by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as an example of an overcompensated Chief Executive Officer. In a September 2015 television interview, Trump stated that the high salaries paid to CEOs was often a "joke" and a "disgrace", Trump cited Macy's, Inc. as an example.[5]
Lundgren has been awarded numerous honors. In 2008, he received the Gold Medal Award from the National Retail Federation,[6] considered the retailing industry's pre-eminent honor. In spring 2008, he was presented with Carnegie Hall's third annual Medal of Excellence for outstanding philanthropic leadership in the arts.[7] The gala held in Lundgren's honor raised $4.2 million for Carnegie Hall. Lundgren is very active in the community; he has been appointed Commissioner on Women's Economic Development by the Mayor of New York. Also, on behalf of NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg he served as one of the industry chairs of Fashion.NYC.2020,[8] which looked at the future of NYC's fashion industry and made recommendations for actionable steps the NYC government could take to promote NYC's fashion industry
He has been presented with several business recognition awards and has served as dinner chairman or as honoree for numerous retail industry organizations and charities, including the Fresh Air Fund, American Jewish Council, Breast Cancer Awareness, NOW Legal Defense, Parsons School and the Ovarian Cancer Society. Lundgren currently serves on the boards of Carnegie Hall, The New York City Partnership and United Way of New York City, as well as participating in numerous other charitable and civic efforts.[citation needed]
Lundgren is chairman of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.[9] He is on the membership committee of the Economic Club of New York[10] and is involved with the New York City Principal for a Day Program.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. After graduating college, he joined Federated and rose quickly to lead the upscale specialty Bullocks Wilshire division in Los Angeles at age 35. Lundgren was married to Nancy Cross until their divorce; he has two daughters from this marriage. Lundgren married Tina Stephan in 2006.[citation needed]
Lundgren is also the namesake of the Terry J. Lundgren Center for Retailing at the University of Arizona, where he is also an alumnus, having graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree. In 2000, Lundgren was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the university's commencement address.[12][13]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
