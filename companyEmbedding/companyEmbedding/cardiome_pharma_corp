                            Cardiomes lead antiarrhythmic product, RSD1235, is designed to be an acute-use, intravenous administration treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition in which the atria of the heart beat rapidly and erratically.  RSD1235 selectively blocks ion channels in the heart that are known to be active during episodes of AF.   Cardiome initiated phase 3 studies in August of 2003. This trial (ACT 1) will provide data on the level of safety and effectiveness of RSD1235 in the acute treatment of AF and atrial flutter. A second Phase 3 study, ACT 2, was initiated in March 2004; this study will focus on patients with AF occurring after coronary artery bypass graft or valve replacement surgery.  In July 2004, Cardiome initiated ACT 3, the third Phase 3 clinical trial for IV RSD1235. ACT 3 is being conducted by co-development partner Fujisawa Healthcare, Inc. and will measure the safety and efficacy of RSD1235 in recent onset atrial arrhythmia patients.  

In a proof-of-concept oral dosing study in humans completed in December 2002, RSD1235 was also shown to have high oral bioavailability, suggesting it could be used for chronic oral therapy, a program for which Cardiome expects to initiate clinical studies by the end of 2004. 

In October 2003, Cardiome licensed North American rights to the intravenous formulation of RSD1235 to Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. Cardiome granted Fujisawa an exclusive license to commercialize IV RSD1235 in North America. The companies will co-develop RSD1235 IV to NDA. Cardiome has retained all rights to the intravenous formulations outside of Canada, US and Mexico, and has also retained worldwide rights to oral RSD1235 for the prevention of AF.

                            Cardiomes lead drug in the congestive heart failure (CHF) area is oxypurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.  CHF is the failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate sufficient to support the bodys needs.  Oxypurinol sensitizes cardiac muscle cells to intracellular calcium, leading to increased cardiac oxygen-use efficiency.  Cardiome believes that increasing the cardiac oxygen-use efficiency will improve the clinical outcomes for CHF patients. Oxypurinol is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oxypurinol in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe symptomatic CHF (rated by the New York Heart Association as class III-IV).

                            Cardiomes lead antiarrhythmic product, RSD1235, is designed to be an acute-use, intravenous administration treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition in which the atria of the heart beat rapidly and erratically.  RSD1235 selectively blocks ion channels in the heart that are known to be active during episodes of AF.   Cardiome initiated phase 3 studies in August of 2003. This trial (ACT 1) will provide data on the level of safety and effectiveness of RSD1235 in the acute treatment of AF and atrial flutter. A second Phase 3 study, ACT 2, was initiated in March 2004; this study will focus on patients with AF occurring after coronary artery bypass graft or valve replacement surgery.  In July 2004, Cardiome initiated ACT 3, the third Phase 3 clinical trial for IV RSD1235. ACT 3 is being conducted by co-development partner Fujisawa Healthcare, Inc. and will measure the safety and efficacy of RSD1235 in recent onset atrial arrhythmia patients.  

In a proof-of-concept oral dosing study in humans completed in December 2002, RSD1235 was also shown to have high oral bioavailability, suggesting it could be used for chronic oral therapy, a program for which Cardiome expects to initiate clinical studies by the end of 2004. 

In October 2003, Cardiome licensed North American rights to the intravenous formulation of RSD1235 to Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. Cardiome granted Fujisawa an exclusive license to commercialize IV RSD1235 in North America. The companies will co-develop RSD1235 IV to NDA. Cardiome has retained all rights to the intravenous formulations outside of Canada, US and Mexico, and has also retained worldwide rights to oral RSD1235 for the prevention of AF.

                            Cardiomes lead drug in the congestive heart failure (CHF) area is oxypurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.  CHF is the failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate sufficient to support the bodys needs.  Oxypurinol sensitizes cardiac muscle cells to intracellular calcium, leading to increased cardiac oxygen-use efficiency.  Cardiome believes that increasing the cardiac oxygen-use efficiency will improve the clinical outcomes for CHF patients. Oxypurinol is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oxypurinol in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe symptomatic CHF (rated by the New York Heart Association as class III-IV).

            Cardiome has developed particular skill and expertise in the 
lead optimization of ion-channel modulating drugs. This strength 
is embodied in three key resources which, within Cardiome, are 
very well-integrated, resulting in fast lead-optimization:

1. Synthetic Chemistry
Cardiome's team of synthetic chemists have years of experience 
in gram-scale synthesis of ion-channel modulating drugs.

2. Analytical Chemistry
Cardiome has equipment and full-time analytical staff to make 
accurate analysis of drug substance concentration, enabling fast 
determination of PK and ADME parameters.

3. In-Vivo and In-Vitro Bioassays
Cardiome has developed strong capability in the areas of in-
vitro cardiac pharmacological testing and in electrophysiology.

Operating in close concert, these skills enable rapid evolution 
of lead molecules to clinical candidates.

NASDAQ: CRME TSX: COMVANCOUVER, July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Cardiome Pharma Corp. (NASDAQ:CRME / TSX:COM) today announced that the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) of Health Canada has approved the AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride) 25 mcg/kg (high) dose bolus ("HDB") regimen, as requested under the Company's supplemental New Drug Submission (sNDS). The 25 mcg/kg AGGRASTAT HDB regimen (25 mcg/kg over three minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.15 mcg/kg/min) will now become the recommended dose to reduce the rate of refractory ischemic conditions, new myocardial infarction and death in high-risk patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who undergo early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Health Canada approved the AGGRASTAT HDB regimen based on evidence from a number of independent studies that indicated that a higher degree of platelet inhibition was beneficial for patients in need of an urgent PCI and thus at a high risk for ischemic events.  The approval was also informed by investigator-initiated clinical studies where the clinical benefit of the AGGRASTAT HDB regimen was demonstrated in patients with NSTE-ACS who undergo early PCI."The approval of the sNDS for a high dose bolus regimen of AGGRASTAT for this higher risk patient population is an important accomplishment as it better aligns the Canadian, United States and European labels and best reflects current clinical practice," said Kiran Bhirangi, M.D., Cardiome's Head of Medical Affairs. "We expect that the label expansion in Canada will offer physicians the opportunity to treat even more patients suffering from NSTE-ACS."About Acute Coronary SyndromesAcute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) is a term that refers to a variety of conditions consistent with acute myocardial ischemia and/or infarction that are usually due to an abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow1. The ACS spectrum includes patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), which is comprised of non-STEMI (NSTEMI) and unstable angina. The thrombus (i.e. blood clot that forms inside a blood vessel or chamber of the heart) formation reduces blood flow in the affected coronary artery and causes ischemic chest pain1.  Research from Datamonitor estimates that in 2013, >880,000 persons in the US experienced an ACS event, while in the major five EU markets, this figure was >650,0002. Furthermore, the number of ACS incidences is expected to grow nearly 40% by 20332. Approximately 70,000 acute myocardial infarctions occur each year in Canada and some 19,000 Canadians die from this condition3.More About AGGRASTAT®AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride, or HCl) is an intravenous (IV) non-peptidal antagonist of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, an important platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation.  AGGRASTAT, in combination with heparin and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is currently approved in Canada for the management of patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, including patients who may subsequently undergo PCI to decrease the rate of refractory ischemic conditions, new myocardial infarction and death.  By blocking fibrinogen from binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, AGGRASTAT prevents the crosslinking of platelets, which is the basis for platelet aggregation.  AGGRASTAT is commercialized in 60 countries worldwide, either by Cardiome or via its extensive distributor and partner network. Cardiome acquired Canadian AGGRASTAT commercialization rights through its acquisition of Correvio LLC in November 2013.About Cardiome Pharma Corp.Cardiome Pharma Corp. is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies that will improve the quality of life and health of patients suffering from disease. Cardiome has two marketed, in-hospital, cardiology products, BRINAVESS® (vernakalant IV), approved in Europe, Canada, and other territories for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in adults, and AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban hydrochloride) a reversible GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor indicated for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Cardiome also commercializes ESMOCARD® and ESMOCARD LYO® (esmolol hydrochloride), a short-acting beta-blocker used to control rapid heart rate in a number of cardiovascular indications, on behalf of their partner Amomed in select European markets. Cardiome has also licensed: XYDALBA (dalbavancin hydrochloride), a second generation, semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide approved in the EU for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults for select European and Middle Eastern nations and Canada from Allergan; and TREVYENT®, a development stage drug device combination that is under development for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension for Europe, the Middle East and for Canadian markets from SteadyMed Therapeutics.Cardiome is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market (CRME) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (COM).

NASDAQ:CRME TSX:COMVANCOUVER, June 12, 2017/PRNewswire/ - Cardiome Pharma Corp. (NASDAQ:CRME / TSX:COM) today announced that it received authorization from Health Canada to begin selling BRINAVESS® (vernakalant hydrochloride, IV) and has subsequently launched BRINAVESS® in Canada. BRINAVESS® is indicated for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation ("AF") to sinus rhythm for: non-surgery patients with AF < 7 days; and post-cardiac surgery patients with duration of AF < 3 days. BRINAVESS® is not recommended for conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. The product is currently available on the Ontario formulary, with a broader launch anticipated in the third quarter of this year as more provinces are expected to include BRINAVESS® in the provincial formularies."The launch of BRINAVESS® in Canada marks the entry of this important treatment into one of the last remaining major markets in the world where BRINAVESS® was previously not available for patients," said Hugues Sachot, Cardiome's Chief Commercial Officer. "Our commercial team has worked diligently with our hospital customers in anticipation of first commercial sale, and we are ready for sales to commence ahead of our previously guided fourth quarter timeline.""This is exciting progress for Cardiome as we continue to build a pharmaceutical company focused on bringing acute care medicines to physicians and patients in hospitals around the world," said William Hunter, M.D., CEO and President of Cardiome. "This milestone is particularly gratifying as BRINAVESS® was discovered by Canadian researchers and will now reach hospitals in Canada in order to help patients suffering from acute onset atrial fibrillation."AF affects approximately 350,000 patients in Canada.1About BRINAVESS®BRINAVESS® (vernakalant HCl, IV) is an antiarrhythmic drug that acts preferentially in the atria by prolonging atrial refractoriness and slowing impulse conduction in a rate-dependent fashion. BRINAVESS® is approved for marketing in Europe, Canada and several other countries worldwide. In Europe, it is approved for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in adults: 1) for non-surgery patients: atrial fibrillation < 7 days duration; and 2) for post-cardiac surgery patients: atrial fibrillation < 3 days duration. Vernakalant IV is not approved for use in the United States.About Atrial FibrillationAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation resulting in ineffective atrial contraction and if left untreated, structural and/or electrophysiological atrial tissue abnormalities.2 AF is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance that increases in prevalence with advancing age.2 According to the American Heart Association, estimates of the prevalence of AF in the U.S. ranged from 2.7 million to 6.1 million in 2010, and is expected to rise to between 5.6 million to 12 million in 2030.3 There are two strategies to manage AF, namely, rhythm- or rate-control. A rhythm-control strategy may be used in patients who are severely compromised, remain symptomatic despite adequate rate control, when adequate rate control is difficult to achieve, when long term rhythm control therapy is preferred, younger patient age, presence of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, and first episode of AF.2, 4 Early intervention with a rhythm-control strategy to prevent progression of AF may be beneficial to the AF patient.2About Cardiome Pharma Corp.Cardiome Pharma Corp. is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies that will improve the quality of life and health of patients suffering from disease. Cardiome has two marketed, in-hospital, cardiology products, BRINAVESS® (vernakalant IV), approved in Europe, Canada, and other territories for the rapid conversion of recent onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in adults, and AGGRASTAT® (tirofiban HCl) a reversible GP IIB/IIIa inhibitor indicated for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
