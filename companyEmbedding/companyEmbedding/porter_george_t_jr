The Porter Trio






photo  courtesy of Denise Sullivan



In Dec of 2013, I got a call from The Maple Leaf booking agent, Ms Paulina Trujillo asking if I could fill in a few Mondays at The Leaf when Jon Cleary was out of town. She asked if I could put together a trio. I said yes give me a couple of days and I'll get back to you. She had three Monday's in Dec. the 16th, Dec 23rd and Dec. 30th open, the next day I called back and took the gigs.On Dec 16, 2013 the band was Michael Lemmler, Simon Lott and myself , it was completely off the hook and I remember having so much fun that I wanted to do it more.I always have so much musical fun working with Michael Lemmler so he was naturally my first choice for a keyboard player, Terrence Houston wasn't available that night so I asked Simon Lott, knowing that I was going to eventually work with Terrence as the drummer for this gig (I just love his energy). I also thought this might be another way to keep my Runnin' Pardners band members working. I had planned on using each one of them on every different Monday night.The second week on December 23 it was Terrence Houston and Brint Anderson and we kind of highlighted some of my old friends with a blues jam featuring music from Earl King and Snooks Eaglin. BAND MEMBERS:George Porter Jr: Bass & VocalsMichael Lemmler: KeyboardsTerrence Houston: Drums & Vocals The third week December 30 was a free-for-all with Terrence Houston on drums and Khris Royal on every instrument he could bring out of his house, LOL. We played so much music that night, we just looked at each other at the end of the gig there was nothing more to say — it was just great.So who and what is the Porter Trio? That's a great question I'm not sure if I have a real answer other then it is three experienced musicians coming out to play together, no rehearsal, no set lists, no idea of what's going to happen. We are there to listen and play off of each other as best as three musicians can play to present a series of songs that are organically played in that moment. The song choices are always different. We are never certain where we are going to go as we play everything from my own music, to blues, soul and good old rock n roll. In the past year the core has become Michael Lemmler, Terrence Houston and myself but you never know who is going to join us.

It's Time To Funk (EP)
by George Porter Jr. and Runnin' Pardners
Over the past year and a half, George Porter Jr. has been collaborating with some amazing musician friends, and these four songs are only a taste of the 28 tracks he has written since his last release Can't Beat the Funk in 2011. It’s Time To Funk pays tribute to his sentimental side, and it has some solid grooves to get you off your seat and onto your feet as well.

The Funky MetersFor tour schedule and management information, please the official Funky Meters website at: http://www.funkymeters.com/schedule/








Formed during an informal jam during the 1989 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Art Neville, George Porter Jr., and Russell Batiste Jr., founded what would be the core of the funky METERS.  The history of founding members Art Neville and George Porter Jr. dates back to 1967, when keyboardist, Art recruited bass player, George, drummer Joseph (Zigaboo) Modeliste and guitarist Leo Nocentelli to form The Meters. In their 31-year history, The Meters have grooved their way around the globe. They have toured with such talents as The Rolling Stones, and have been a studio band for such diverse artists as Dr. John, Paul McCartney, Robert Palmer, and Patti Labelle. The original Meters disbanded in the late 70’s. Today founding members Art Neville and George Porter Jr., are joined by New Orleans native Brian Stoltz on guitar and Russell Batiste Jr. on drums and are known officially as the funky METERS. funky METERS tap into the roots of The Meters musical heritage while taking the sound well into the future. Their trademark sound blends funk, blues, and dance grooves with a New Orleans vibe.In 1994, Art and George were joined by guitarist Brian Stoltz and Russell Batiste and officially christened The Funky METERS. This lineup carried the funk torch until the spring of 2007 when Stoltz left to pursue his solo career and Ian Neville, the son of Meters founder Art Neville joined the line up taking over guitar duties. Growing up in the Neville house of music and touring with The Neville Brothers, as well Ivan Neville’s Dumpstaphunk, Ian was poised to step in to help bring the band into the future. In 2011, Brian Stoltz was invited to play with funky METERS when Ian was committed to his band, Dumpstaphunk, gigs. BAND MEMBERS:Art Neville: Hammond Organ, Keys & VocalsGeorge Porter Jr.: Bass & VocalsBrian Stoltz: Guitar & VocalsTerrence Houston: Drums & Vocals Once the band was onstage it was if they hadn’t skipped a beat, the band and audience both knew Brian was meant to be there. After four years with Ian in the band, the time came for him to focus on his own band’s success and funky METERS invited Brian to rejoin full time.2014 saw a changing of the guardian of the groove.  After an amazing 20+ year run with David Russell Batiste, Jr. holding down the drum throne, funky METERS welcomed Terrence Houston to the band as the new groove guardian. "I'm honored that I've been given the opportunity to share the stage with a group of legends", says Terrence.The collective resume between the four artists in the band speaks volumes for the level of musicianship and creativity that comes alive when they play together on any stage.  After three years of solid touring including dates at Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Jamcruise, The Fillmore Auditorium and countless others the funky METERS are stronger than ever.  In fact, the funk is still going as strong today as it was 40 plus years ago.
