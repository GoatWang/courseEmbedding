Atkore International Group Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results

        Diluted EPS increased to $0.28 from $0.22; Adjusted diluted EPS
        increased to $0.35 from $0.31;
      
        Net income increased $4.9 million to $18.9 million from $14.0 million;
      
        Net income margin increased to 5.1% from 4.0%; Adjusted EBITDA Margin
        of 15.1%;
      
        Full-year Adjusted EPS guidance range tightened to $1.55 - $1.65HARVEY, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Atkore International Group Inc. (the "Company" or "Atkore") (NYSE: ATKR)
      announced earnings for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended March 31,
      2017 ("second quarter").
    
      "Our second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was in-line with our expectations.
      Despite continued softness in overall non-residential construction
      markets, we are seeing some momentum in our early-cycle products and
      stabilization within the general industrial market. Atkore is
      well-positioned to take advantage of expected market improvements with a
      focus on innovative new product introductions and continuous improvement
      initiatives," commented John Williamson, Atkore’s President and CEO.
    2017 Second Quarter Results
      Net sales for the second quarter increased to $372.8 million, an
      increase of 5.6% compared to $353.0 million for the prior-year period
      primarily due to increased sales within the Electrical Raceway segment.
    
      Gross profit decreased by 3.8% to $87.9 million for the second quarter
      of 2017, as compared to $91.4 million for the prior-year period. The
      decline in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower sales of
      mechanical pipe products within the solar end market. Gross margin
      decreased to 23.6% in the second quarter from 25.9% in the prior-year
      period. Gross margin was negatively impacted as a result of passing
      through rising input costs.
    
      Net income increased $4.9 million to $18.9 million for the second
      quarter, as compared to $14.0 million for the prior-year period. The
      increase in net income was primarily driven by $6.4 million of lower
      stock-based compensation expense, lower interest expense of $5.3 million
      resulting from lower debt and lower interest rates driven by our debt
      refinancing transactions on December 22, 2016 as well as the recognition
      of a $5.8 million gain on the sale of the company’s minority interest in
      a joint venture. The increase is partially offset by a $7.5 million
      accrual for a legal contingency for the period November 2014 through
      March 2017 related to a U.S. Commerce Department ruling on malleable
      iron pipe fittings and $3.6 million of lower tax expense.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.8%, or $2.2 million, to $56.1 million for
      the second quarter, as compared to $58.4 million for the prior-year
      period. Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased to 15.1%, as compared to 16.5%
      for the prior-year period. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction
      in gross profit.
    
      Diluted earnings per share were $0.28 for the quarter compared to $0.22
      in the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased
      by $0.04 to $0.35 for the second quarter as compared to $0.31 for the
      prior-year period.
    Segment ResultsElectrical Raceway
      Electrical Raceway net sales increased $19.8 million, or 8.6%, to $251.1
      million for the second quarter, as compared to $231.3 million for the
      prior-year period, primarily resulting from our ability to pass through
      higher input costs.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.7 million, or 6.4%, to $44.9 million for
      the second quarter, as compared to $42.2 million for the prior-year
      period, primarily due to the pass-through impact of higher input costs
      and our ability to earn a premium from meeting customer expectations of
      product availability, delivery service levels and co-loading
      capabilities and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset
      by lower sales volumes resulting from softness in non-residential
      activity.
    Mechanical Products & Solutions ("MP&S")
      MP&S net sales were in-line with the prior year period, experiencing a
      slight reduction of $0.2 million, or 0.2%, to $122.0 million for the
      second quarter, as compared to $122.2 million for the prior-year period.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5.1 million, or 22.6%, to $17.3 million for
      the second quarter as compared to $22.3 million for the prior-year
      period, primarily due to lower sales volumes of mechanical pipe products
      within the solar end-market, which are typically higher margin products.
    2017 Full-Year Guidance
      The Company is tightening its Adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $235.0
      million - $245.0 million for 2017 and its Adjusted EPS guidance range to
      $1.55 - $1.65 primarily due to continued softness in the non-residential
      construction markets.
    
      A reconciliation of the forward-looking full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA
      outlook is not being provided, as the Company does not currently have
      sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual
      adjustments for such reconciliations.

      known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond
      our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not
      guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance
      and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of
      operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of
      the market in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in
      or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this press
      release. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial
      condition and cash flows, and the development of the market in which we
      operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in
      this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative
      of results or developments in subsequent periods.
    
      A number of important factors, including, without limitation, the risks

      Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the U.S. Securities and
      Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 9, 2017 could cause actual results
      and outcomes to differ materially from those reflected in the
      forward-looking statements. Additional factors that could cause actual
      results and outcomes to differ from those reflected in forward-looking
      statements include, without limitation: declines in, and uncertainty
      regarding, the general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and
      international markets in which we operate; weakness or another downturn
      in the U.S. non-residential construction industry; changes in prices of
      raw materials; pricing pressure, reduced profitability, or loss of
      market share due to intense competition; availability and cost of
      third-party freight carriers and energy; high levels of imports of
      products similar to those manufactured by us; changes in federal, state,
      local and international governmental regulations and trade policies;
      adverse weather conditions; failure to generate sufficient cash flow
      from operations or to raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to
      satisfy existing obligations and support the development of our
      business; increased costs relating to future capital and operating
      expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental, health and
      safety laws; reduced spending by, deterioration in the financial
      condition of, or other adverse developments with respect to, one or more
      of our top customers; increases in our working capital needs, which are
      substantial and fluctuate based on economic activity and the market
      prices for our main raw materials, including as a result of failure to
      collect, or delays in the collection of, cash from the sale of
      manufactured products; work stoppage or other interruptions of
      production at our facilities as a result of disputes under existing
      collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with
      negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements, as a result of
      supplier financial distress, or for other reasons; challenges attracting
      and retaining key personnel or high-quality employees; changes in our
      financial obligations relating to pension plans that we maintain in the
      United States; reduced production or distribution capacity due to
      interruptions in the operations of our facilities or those of our key
      suppliers; loss of a substantial number of our third-party agents or
      distributors or a dramatic deviation from the amount of sales they
      generate; security threats, attacks, or other disruptions to our
      information systems, or failure to comply with complex network security,
      data privacy and other legal obligations or the failure to protect
      sensitive information; possible impairment of goodwill or other
      long-lived assets as a result of future triggering events, such as
      declines in our cash flow projections or customer demand; safety and
      labor risks associated with the manufacture and in the testing of our
      products; product liability, construction defect and warranty claims and
      litigation relating to our various products, as well as government
      inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other
      legal proceedings; our ability to protect our intellectual property and
      other material proprietary rights; risks inherent in doing business
      internationally; our inability to introduce new products effectively or
      implement our innovation strategies; the inability of our customers to
      pay off the credit lines extended to them by us in a timely manner and
      the negative impact on customer relations resulting from our collections
      efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers; our
      inability to continue importing raw materials, component parts and/or
      finished goods; changes in legislation, regulation and government policy
      as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional
      elections; the incurrence of liabilities and the issuance of additional
      debt or equity in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or
      divestitures; failure to manage acquisitions successfully, including
      identifying, evaluating, and valuing acquisition targets and integrating
      acquired companies, businesses or assets; the incurrence of liabilities
      in connection with violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
      and similar foreign anti-corruption laws; the incurrence of additional
      expenses, increase in complexity of our supply chain and potential
      damage to our reputation with customers resulting from regulations
      related to "conflict minerals"; disruptions or impediments to the
      receipt of sufficient raw materials resulting from various
      anti-terrorism security measures; restrictions contained in our debt
      agreements; failure to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of,
      interest on, or other amounts due on our debt; the significant influence
      the Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC investor will have continued to have
      over corporate decisions; and other factors described from time to time
      in documents that we file with the SEC. The Company assumes no
      obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only
      as of the date hereof.
    Non-GAAP Financial Information
      This press release includes certain financial information, not prepared
      in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
      United States ("GAAP"). Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP
      financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein
      may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other
      companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes
      for the performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. See
      non-GAAP reconciliations below in this press release for a
      reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
      financial measures.
    Adjusted Net Sales
      We present Adjusted net sales to facilitate comparisons of reported net
      sales from period to period within our MP&S segment. In August 2015, we
      announced plans to exit the Fence and Sprinkler product lines in order
      to re-align our long-term strategic focus. These product lines were
      exited during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Management uses Adjusted
      net sales to evaluate our ongoing business operations, which no longer
      include Fence and Sprinkler. We define Adjusted net sales as reported
      net sales excluding net sales directly attributable to Fence and
      Sprinkler.
    Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
      We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in evaluating the
      performance of our business, and we use each in the preparation of our
      annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and
      profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
      allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical
      comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.
    
      We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: depreciation and
      amortization, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, interest expense
      (net), income tax expense, restructuring and impairments, stock-based
      compensation, legal matters, consulting fees, transaction costs, gain on
      sale of joint venture, other items, and the impact from our Fence and
      Sprinkler exit. Prior to fiscal 2017, net income was also adjusted to
      exclude net periodic pension benefit costs and the impact from
      anti-microbial coated sprinkler pipe, or "ABF" product liability. These
      costs are no longer an adjustment to EBITDA beginning in fiscal 2017.
      Prior fiscal years have not been restated for this change due to the
      relative insignificance and nature of the amounts. We believe Adjusted
      EBITDA, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, is
      useful for investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in
      evaluating the performance of our business.
    
      We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
      Adjusted net sales.
    Net Income Margin
      We define Net Income Margin as Net income as a percentage of Net sales.
    Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share
      We use Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share in evaluating
      the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes
      that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering
      additional ways of viewing the Company’s results that, when reconciled
      to the corresponding GAAP measure provide an indication of performance
      and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and or non-cash items.
      We define Adjusted net income as net income before consulting fees, loss
      on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense and other
      items, including the impact from our Fence and Sprinkler exit. We define
      Adjusted earnings per share as basic and diluted earnings per share
      excluding the per share impact of consulting fees, loss (gain) on
      extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of joint venture, legal matters,
      stock-based compensation and other items, including the impact from our
      Fence and Sprinkler exit.
    Leverage Ratio - Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA
      We define leverage ratio as the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash
      and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve month
      basis. We believe the leverage ratio is useful to investors as an
      alternative liquidity measure.

Atkore International Group Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results

02.07.17


Atkore International Group Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results

        Diluted EPS increased to $0.26 from $0.14; Adjusted diluted EPS
        increased to $0.28 from $0.23
        Net income increased $8.8 million to $17.4 million from $8.6 million;
        Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.8%, or $1.8 million to $49.9 million
        Net income margin increased to 5.1% from 2.4%; Adjusted EBITDA Margin
        increased by 110 basis points to 14.8%
      
        Full-year Adjusted EPS guidance range increased $0.15 to $1.55 - $1.70HARVEY, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Atkore International Group Inc. (the "Company" or "Atkore") (NYSE: ATKR)
      announced earnings for its fiscal 2017 first quarter ended December 30,
      2016 ("first quarter").
    
      "Our first quarter Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per share were
      in-line with our expectations," commented John Williamson, Atkore’s
      President and CEO. "The Atkore team continues to outperform the market
      inputs by focusing on productivity through the Atkore Business System
      and driving margin expansion by selling higher value innovative products
      and managing input cost changes. Feedback from our channel partners,
      customers and market indicators point to a strong second half in 2017
      and give us confidence to reconfirm our prior guidance."
    2017 First Quarter Results
      Net sales for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $337.6 million, a
      decline of 5.8% compared to $358.4 million for the prior-year period.
      Adjusted net sales, which exclude the Fence and Sprinkler product lines
      which the Company exited in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, declined
      3.7%, as compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven mainly from lower
      demand for mechanical pipe product offset by average selling price
      increases.
    
      Gross profit increased by 27.1% to $92.0 million for the first quarter
      of 2017, as compared to $72.4 million for the prior-year period. Gross
      margin expanded to 27.3% in the first quarter from 20.2% in the
      prior-year period. Gross margin increased primarily due to the Company's
      ability to pass through its material cost increases and improving
      productivity in manufacturing freight and warehousing costs.
    
      Net income increased $8.8 million to $17.4 million for the first
      quarter, as compared to $8.6 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted
      net income increased to $18.4 million as compared to $14.5 million for
      prior-year period. The increase in both net income and adjusted net
      income was primarily driven by the Company's expanded gross margins.
    
      The Company completed a refinancing of our credit facilities and lowered
      our total debt by $136.6 million as compared to September 30, 2016. As a
      result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.8
      million during the first quarter of 2017.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 million, or 3.8%, to $49.9 million for
      the first quarter, as compared to $48.1 million for the prior-year
      period. Net income margin increased to 5.1% from 2.4% in the prior-year
      period and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 14.8% from 13.7%.
    
      Basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.28 and $0.26, respectively,
      for the quarter compared to $0.14 and $0.14 in the prior-year period.
      Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by $0.05 to $0.28 per
      share for the first quarter as compared to $0.23 per share for the
      prior-year period.
    Segment ResultsElectrical Raceway
      Electrical Raceway net sales decreased $0.6 million, or 0.3%, to $223.0
      million for the first quarter, as compared to $223.6 million for the
      prior-year period, primarily due to lower volume of products sold offset
      by increased pricing in the nonresidential markets.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.9 million, or 17.1%, to $40.3 million for
      the first quarter, as compared to $34.4 million for the prior-year
      period, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 18.1% from 15.4%
      primarily attributable to productivity savings, selling higher value
      products and our ability to pass through input cost changes.
    Mechanical Products & Solutions
      MP&S net sales declined $19.9 million, or 14.7%, to $115.2 million for
      the first quarter, as compared to $135.1 million for the prior-year
      period. Adjusted net sales, which exclude the Fence and Sprinkler
      businesses, decreased $12.1 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to lower
      demand for mechanical pipe product in the solar end market offset in
      part by higher volume for construction services and international
      businesses.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.8 million, or 9.3%, to $17.6 million for
      the first quarter as compared to $19.4 million for the prior-year period
      due to the decrease in volume offset partially by productivity savings
      and increased prices.
    2017 Full-Year Guidance
      Adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged in the range of $235.0
      million - $250.0 million for 2017. The Company is raising its Adjusted
      EPS guidance range to $1.55 - $1.70, an increase of $0.15 from the
      mid-point of the prior forecast, primarily due to the impact of the debt
      refinancing.

      "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or other comparable terms.
      Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, all matters that
      are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements are subject to
      known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond
      our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not
      guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance
      and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of
      operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of
      the market in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in
      or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this press
      release. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial
      condition and cash flows, and the development of the market in which we
      operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in
      this press release, those results or developments may not be indicative
      of results or developments in subsequent periods.
    
      A number of important factors, including, without limitation, the risks
      and uncertainties discussed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our
      Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
      Commission ("SEC") on November 29, 2016 could cause actual results and
      outcomes to differ materially from those reflected in the
      forward-looking statements. Additional factors that could cause actual
      results and outcomes to differ from those reflected in forward-looking
      statements include, without limitation: declines in, and uncertainty
      regarding, the general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and
      international markets in which we operate; weakness or another downturn
      in the U.S. non-residential construction industry; changes in prices of
      raw materials; pricing pressure, reduced profitability, or loss of
      market share due to intense competition; availability and cost of
      third-party freight carriers and energy; high levels of imports of
      products similar to those manufactured by us; changes in federal, state,
      local and international governmental regulations and trade policies;
      adverse weather conditions; failure to generate sufficient cash flow
      from operations or to raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to
      satisfy existing obligations and support the development of our
      business; increased costs relating to future capital and operating
      expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental, health and
      safety laws; reduced spending by, deterioration in the financial
      condition of, or other adverse developments with respect to, one or more
      of our top customers; increases in our working capital needs, which are
      substantial and fluctuate based on economic activity and the market
      prices for our main raw materials, including as a result of failure to
      collect, or delays in the collection of, cash from the sale of
      manufactured products; work stoppage or other interruptions of
      production at our facilities as a result of disputes under existing
      collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with
      negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements, as a result of
      supplier financial distress, or for other reasons; challenges attracting
      and retaining key personnel or high-quality employees; changes in our
      financial obligations relating to pension plans that we maintain in the
      United States; reduced production or distribution capacity due to
      interruptions in the operations of our facilities or those of our key
      suppliers; loss of a substantial number of our third-party agents or
      distributors or a dramatic deviation from the amount of sales they
      generate; security threats, attacks, or other disruptions to our
      information systems, or failure to comply with complex network security,
      data privacy and other legal obligations or the failure to protect
      sensitive information; possible impairment of goodwill or other
      long-lived assets as a result of future triggering events, such as
      declines in our cash flow projections or customer demand; safety and
      labor risks associated with the manufacture and in the testing of our
      products; product liability, construction defect and warranty claims and
      litigation relating to our various products, as well as government
      inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other
      legal proceedings; our ability to protect our intellectual property and
      other material proprietary rights; risks inherent in doing business
      internationally; our inability to introduce new products effectively or
      implement our innovation strategies; the inability of our customers to
      pay off the credit lines extended to them by us in a timely manner and
      the negative impact on customer relations resulting from our collections
      efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers; the
      incurrence of liabilities and the issuance of additional debt or equity
      in connection with acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures; failure
      to manage acquisitions successfully, including identifying, evaluating,
      and valuing acquisition targets and integrating acquired companies,
      businesses or assets; the incurrence of liabilities in connection with
      violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign
      anti-corruption laws; the incurrence of additional expenses, increase in
      complexity of our supply chain and potential damage to our reputation
      with customers resulting from regulations related to "conflict
      minerals"; disruptions or impediments to the receipt of sufficient raw
      materials resulting from various anti-terrorism security measures;
      restrictions contained in our debt agreements; failure to generate cash
      sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due on
      our debt; the significant influence our majority stockholder will have
      over corporate decisions; and other factors described from time to time
      in documents that we file with the SEC. The Company assumes no
      obligation to update the information contained herein, which speaks only
      as of the date hereof.
    Non-GAAP Financial Information
      This press release includes certain financial information, not prepared
      in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the
      United States ("GAAP"). Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP
      financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein
      may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other
      companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes
      for the performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. See
      non-GAAP reconciliations below in this press release for a
      reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
      financial measures.
    Adjusted Net Sales
      We present Adjusted net sales to facilitate comparisons of reported net
      sales from period to period within our MP&S segment. In August 2015, we
      announced plans to exit the Fence and Sprinkler product lines in order
      to re-align our long-term strategic focus. These product lines were
      exited during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Management uses Adjusted
      net sales to evaluate our ongoing business operations, which no longer
      include Fence and Sprinkler. We define Adjusted net sales as reported
      net sales excluding net sales directly attributable to Fence and
      Sprinkler.
    Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
      We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in evaluating the
      performance of our business, and use each in the preparation of our
      annual operating budgets and as indicators of business performance and
      profitability. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
      allow us to readily view operating trends, perform analytical
      comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance.
    
      We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: depreciation and
      amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, interest expense (net),
      income tax expense, restructuring and impairments, stock-based
      compensation, legal settlements, consulting fees, transaction costs,
      other items, and the impact from our Fence and Sprinkler exit. Prior to
      fiscal 2017, net income was also adjusted to exclude net periodic
      pension benefit costs and the impact from anti-microbial coated
      sprinkler pipe, or "ABF" product liability. These costs are no longer an
      adjustment to EBITDA beginning in fiscal 2017 due to the relevant
      insignificance and nature of the amounts. Prior fiscal years have not
      been restated for this change. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when
      presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, is useful for
      investors because management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the
      performance of our business.
    
      We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
      Adjusted net sales.
    Net Income Margin
      We define Net Income Margin as Net income as a percentage of Net sales.
    Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share
      We use Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share in evaluating
      the performance of our business and profitability. Management believes
      that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering
      additional ways of viewing the Company’s results that, when reconciled
      to the corresponding GAAP measure provide an indication of performance
      and profitability excluding the impact of unusual and or non-cash items.
      We define Adjusted net income as net income before consulting fees, loss
      on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense and other
      items, including the impact from our Fence and Sprinkler exit. We define
      Adjusted earnings per share as basic and diluted earnings per share
      excluding the per share impact of consulting fees, loss on
      extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation and other items,
      including the impact from our Fence and Sprinkler exit.
    Leverage Ratio - Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA
      We define leverage ratio as the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash
      and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve month
      basis. We believe the leverage ratio is useful to investors as an
      alternative liquidity measure.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
