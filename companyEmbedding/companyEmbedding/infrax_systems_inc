The Power to Secure

















 
 




Corporate Video
Eli Kahn discusses security


 

 
The Power to Secure the Future
Internet of Everything through Grid Optimization and Security, all in an integrated state-of-the-art Smart Grid solution.
According to a report issued to Congress by the  Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, as required by Section  1309 of Title XIII of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the  security of any future Smart Grid is dependent on successfully addressing the  cyber security issues associated with the nation?s current power grid.
The complexity of the grid implies that  vulnerabilities exist that have not yet been identified. It is particularly  difficult to estimate risk from cyber attack because of the size, complexity,  and dynamic nature of the power grid and the unpredictability of potential  attackers.
INFRAX creates a unified solution path to  securely manage Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and other Smart Grid  optimization applications such as substation automation. Our product portfolio  provides Network Transport and Management , Secure Intelligent Devices, and  Threat Detection.  Grid Optimization and Security, all in an integrated  state-of-the-art Smart Grid solution.

(IFXY) Prepares the Process for Uplisting on a Senior ExchangePR NewswireOctober 11, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Oct. 11, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- INFRAX SYSTEMS, Inc. (OTC BB:IFXY.ob - News), a global provider of unified Smart Grid-related products and services for the Energy and Utility industries, announced today that its Board of Directors, as approved by their majority shareholder, has approved the initiation of the process for the up-list on NASDAQ Capital Market immediately. The Company believes that, given its balance sheet position (Post SPC acquisition), it would meet all of the quantitative listing requirements for The NASDAQ Capital Market, other than those relating to the minimum bid price for listed shares (which is $4 per share). The Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in achieving a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market or any other exchange. The process of qualification and listing may require additional due diligence and consultation with appropriate entities and FINRA. We will inform our shareholders of our progress as we initiate and complete the process."The Board of Directors feels that based on our growth potential, present & future partners, Initial Public Offerings of our main competitors, our world-class products and services, our utility customers and our acquisition of SPC (Southern Power & Control), we believe increases the chance of the Company successfully listing the Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, particularly The NASDAQ Capital Market," stated Sam Talari, INFRAX SYSTEMS, Inc. Co-Chairman. "We further believe that listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market would enhance the Company's visibility, commercial credibility and create a better liquid marketplace for our investors and better financing terms that would allow for certain commercial opportunities not currently available to the Company. The Company believes that a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, if effectuated, may generate greater interest among our present and future customers and set us among our peers and competitors trading on the big board hence allowing for institutional ownership and analyst coverage and brokerage recommendations.""We believe that by taking this step, the Company will be able to maximize its long term growth opportunities and the return to our investors. We have developed products which will significantly impact the way in which utilities implement grid security and we are now preparing to bring these products to market," said Paul J. Aiello, INFRAX SYSTEMS, Inc. CEO. "Institutional investment will allow us to access additional equity capital to help fuel our growth both organic and through acquisition."  About INFRAX SYSTEMS, Inc.INFRAX SYSTEMS, Inc. offers a series of interrelated operational management, communications, and grid security related products and services known as Secure Intelligent Energy Platform (SIEP).
