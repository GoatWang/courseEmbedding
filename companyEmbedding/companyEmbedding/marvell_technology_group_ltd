This product line was classified as part of the Company's other product category. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, this product line will be reclassified and added to discontinued operations. The Company's revenue guidance provided for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 excludes revenue associated with this sale, which has been approximately $5 million per quarter.
"Marvell executed well in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a renewed focus on its core businesses of storage, networking and connectivity were able to generate revenue growth of 12% year-over-year, driven by the long-term secular growth trends in the amount of data being created, stored and transmitted both wired and wirelessly," said Marvell's President and CEO, Matt Murphy. "We are pleased to see that this growth was accompanied by a significant expansion in gross and operating margin, demonstrating the strength in our business model and the value Marvell's solutions are bringing to our customers."
Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook

Revenue is expected to be $585 to $615 million. This range excludes approximately $5 million in revenue associated with sale of LTE thin-modem business. 
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 61%. 
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $237 million to $247 million. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $215 million to $220 million. 
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.27. 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.30.

Discontinued Operations
The Company's financial results for prior periods presented herein have been recast to reflect certain businesses that were classified as discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.
Conference Call
Marvell will conduct a conference call on Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Interested parties may join the conference call by dialing 1-844-647-5488 or 1-615-247-0258, pass-code 17273674. The call will be webcast by Thomson Reuters and can be accessed at the Marvell Investor Relations website at http://investor.marvell.com/ with a replay available following the call until June 2, 2017.
Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of share-based compensation expense, amortization and write-off of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, restructuring and other related charges, litigation settlement, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell's core operating performance.
In fiscal 2018, Marvell began using a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Marvell's non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency. Marvell's non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; significant changes in Marvell's geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell's corporate structure. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a non-GAAP tax rate of 4% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results.
Non-GAAP diluted net income per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income from continuing operations by non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). For purposes of calculating non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) is adjusted to exclude the potential benefits of share-based compensation expected to be incurred in future periods but not yet recognized in the financial statements. The expected compensation costs are treated as additional proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.
Marvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell's financial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance.
Externally, management believes that investors may find Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell's operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas:

Management's evaluation of Marvell's operating performance; 
Management's establishment of internal operating budgets; 
Management's performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; and 
Management's determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).

Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell's results as reported under GAAP. Marvell expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from Marvell's non-GAAP net income should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.
Forward-Looking Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including: Marvell's expectations regarding its second quarter of fiscal 2018 financial outlook; and Marvell's use of non-GAAP financial measures as important supplemental information. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "can," "may," "will," "would" and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements.

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Main article: List of Marvell Technology Group chipsets




Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Main article: List of Marvell Technology Group chipsets




Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Announces Progress on Acquisition of Galileo Technology Ltd.

Sunnyvale, California

                  (November 28, 2000) –

          Marvell® Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) today reported that it continues to make progress toward completing its acquisition of Galileo Technology Ltd. (NASDAQ:GALT). 
On October 17, 2000, Marvell and Galileo announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which Marvell will acquire Galileo. Depending upon the timing of final regulatory and shareholder approvals, the merger is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2001.
"Both Marvell and Galileo are working diligently toward the completion of this acquisition, which will combine two leading companies into an IC-communications powerhouse," said Dr. Sehat Sutardja, President and CEO of Marvell Technology Group Ltd. "Since announcing this proposed business combination, we have made the required filings under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act and filed our preliminary joint proxy-prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because Galileo is incorporated in Israel, we also filed our Merger Proposal before the Israeli Companies Registrar, which began the 70-day waiting period under Israeli law." 
Additionally, Marvell and Galileo recently posted "Frequently Asked Questions" about the proposed merger on their Web sites to aid shareholders in better understanding the technologies of both companies, the near-term and longer-term synergies expected from the merger, and the proposed transaction itself. These "FAQs" can be accessed at www.marvell.com or at www.galileot.com.

Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Opens Regional Headquarters and Advanced Technology Design Center in Singapore to Support Expanding International Customer Base

Singapore

                  (October 30, 2000) –

          Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL), a technology leader in the development of extreme broadband DSP-based mixed-signal integrated circuits for communications-related markets, today announced the opening of a new regional headquarters and advanced integrated circuit (IC) design center in Singapore. At ceremonies today, key Marvell executives and government officials gathered to officially dedicate the new facility in the New Tech Park section of Singapore.
Marvell established the regional headquarters and state-of-the-art design center in Singapore, through Marvell Asia Pte Ltd. (MAPL), to support its expanding international customer base. The MAPL IC design team, trained at Marvell's U.S. facilities, will expand Marvell's expertise for global communications in the local region by developing high performance data storage and high-speed data communications products. Marvell plans to complete significant investments over the next five years in its cutting-edge design center to develop leading-edge, broadband communications devices. Marvell plans to recruit significant additional engineering resources, including design engineers and product and test engineers, over the next few years to further support this effort.
MAPL headquarters is also chartered with the management of the Company's Asia Pacific sales offices including Taiwan and Japan. In addition to IC design and development, MAPL will concentrate on sales, customer service, manufacturing operations, finance and administration, IT and human resources efforts.
"Opening a regional headquarters and a cutting-edge technology design center in Singapore is a logical next step for Marvell in its quest for global expansion. Singapore is a semiconductor hub that offers many benefits including an excellent business environment and communications infrastructure, a central location and semiconductor manufacturing fabrication support," said Dr. Sehat Sutardja, Marvell Technology Group Ltd's President and CEO.

As previously disclosed, a special committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has conducted an internal review relating to the Company’s historical stock option practices and related accounting matters. The Company is working diligently to complete the restatement of its historical financial statements and file its delayed Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K as soon as practicable.

On May 25, 2007, the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council issued a decision staying any delisting action and granting an extension to June 26, 2007 for Marvell to file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2007 and its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended October 28, 2006 and July 29, 2006. Marvell intends to make an additional submission to the Listing Council regarding its plans to file the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 28, 2007.

Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Files Financial Report for Q1 Fiscal 2008

Santa Clara, California

                  (July 9, 2007) –

          arvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL) today announced that it has completed and filed with the SEC its previously delayed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 28, 2007. As previously disclosed, the Company's filing was delayed as a result of an internal review conducted by a special committee of the Company’s Board of Directors relating to the Company’s historical stock option practices and related accounting matters. 

 Additional Information 
 Marvell today filed a Current Report on Form 8-K that incorporates this press release and also provides, in addition to the Company's quarterly financial results for each of the quarters of Fiscal 2007 and 2006 and the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reconciliations of GAAP net income and net income per share to non-GAAP net income and net income per share for each of those quarters. Marvell management believes the non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of its ongoing economic performance and Marvell therefore uses non-GAAP reporting internally to evaluate and manage its operations. Marvell has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform comparisons of operating results in a manner similar to how the Company analyzes its operating results internally. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be used to facilitate comparisons of our results with that of other companies in our industry. Please refer to the Form 8-K filed today, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on the Investors section of Marvell’s website at www.marvell.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Common Problems With Microsoft Drivers

Driver is missing or corrupt
Driver is out-of-date
Previous attempt to update driver failed
The current driver is the incorrect driver for the device
The device is damaged and needs to be replaced or repaired (drivers cannot fix hardware issues)

Installing the most current and accurate driver will typically fix most problems that are experienced while operating Windows hardware devices.
     The original driver for any given hardware device often has been updated many times by the manufacturer to fix bugs and improve efficiency. Many users experience problems
     with older Windows devices for this reason.
    
     There are many challenges when updating drivers. Finding the correct driver for all the devices in your Windows computer can be a hassle and installation can sometimes be tedious at best.
     You simply want your hardware to work and with the best performance!

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

Marvell's development center in Petah Tikva, Israel


Marvell Technology Group, Limited, is a producer of storage, communications and consumer semiconductor products. The company was founded in 1995 and has approximately 7,000 employees.[3] Marvell's U.S. operating headquarters is located in Santa Clara, California, and the company operates design centers in places including Canada, Europe, Israel, India, Singapore and China.[4] Marvell is a "fabless" manufacturer of semiconductors (meaning that it is active entirely in core competencies of engineering and design, with the actual manufacturing outsourced to contract manufacturers in lower-cost emerging markets) that ships more than one billion integrated circuits (known as "chips") per year.[3] Its market segments include the enterprise, cloud, automotive, industrial and consumer markets.

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

Marvell's development center in Petah Tikva, Israel


Marvell Technology Group, Limited, is a producer of storage, communications and consumer semiconductor products. The company was founded in 1995 and has approximately 7,000 employees.[3] Marvell's U.S. operating headquarters is located in Santa Clara, California, and the company operates design centers in places including Canada, Europe, Israel, India, Singapore and China.[4] Marvell is a "fabless" manufacturer of semiconductors (meaning that it is active entirely in core competencies of engineering and design, with the actual manufacturing outsourced to contract manufacturers in lower-cost emerging markets) that ships more than one billion integrated circuits (known as "chips") per year.[3] Its market segments include the enterprise, cloud, automotive, industrial and consumer markets.

History[edit]
Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja.[5] The initial public offering on June 27, 2000 (near the end of the dot-com bubble) raised $90 million, with the stock listed on NASDAQ with the symbol MRVL.[6] After quickly raising from $19 to over $63 per share, three days later it was $55.25.[7] At the time, the five largest customers, Samsung Electronics, Hitachi, Seagate Technology, Fujitsu and Toshiba, accounted for 97% of sales.[8] The shares dropped sharply in December when insiders were allowed to sell.[9]
The company is officially headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.[6] The US operations known as Marvell Semiconductor, Incorporated, are located in Silicon Valley, California.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
Through the years, Marvell acquired smaller companies to enter new markets.

Marvell's operating headquarters in Santa Clara


Products[edit]
Main article: List of Marvell Technology Group chipsets




Marvell Yukon Gigabit Ethernet controller in a Sony Vaio FW series laptop


Ethernet[edit]
Marvell's first products were sold for computer data storage devices. In March 2000, computer networking products for the Ethernet family were first shipped.[8] In October 2002, the Yukon brand Gigabit Ethernet controller was announced.[20]
XScale[edit]
On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale business to Marvell for an estimated USD 600 million in cash and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The acquisition was completed on November 9, 2006.[17]
SheevaPlug[edit]
In 2009, Marvell announced that the SheevaPlug, a small, low-power, SoC-based ARM architecture computer, would be released with full schematics.[21][22][23][24][clarification needed]
iPhone[edit]
Marvell supplied the Wi-Fi chip for the original (first-generation) Apple iPhone.[25]
MMH[edit]
Marvell Mobile Hotspot (MMH) is an in-car Wi-Fi connectivity. The 2010 Audi A8 was the first automobile in the market to feature a factory-installed MMH.[26]
Chromecast[edit]
Google's Chromecast products are powered by Marvell SoCs. Namely the Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini SoC (88DE3005) for the Chromecast 1st gen and Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) for the Chromecast 2nd gen & Chromecast audio.[27]
In 2012, Marvell was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators.[28]
Legal cases[edit]
Stock options[edit]
In 2006, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started an inquiry on the company's stock option grant practices.[29] An investigation determined "grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight" to make the options more valuable.[30] The press estimated that the founders and other executives had made $760 million in gains from the options, which were awarded by the founding couple, Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai.[31] The SEC asked to interview the company general counsel Matthew Gloss, but Marvell claimed attorney-client privilege.[32] Gloss was fired just before the investigation results were announced in May 2007.[33] Abraham David Sofaer was hired to investigate the investigation after Gloss alleged it was not independent. In announcing the results of its own inquiry, the SEC did not give Marvell the credit granted other companies in the options scandal for cooperating [with the SEC’s investigation] or [for] cleaning up. >[34] At the time of the announcement, the co-acting regional director of the SEC’s San Francisco office stated, among other things, that [the SEC] did not believe that the [lack of] cooperation and remediation [shown by Marvell] merited a whole lot of credit in terms of giving [Marvell] a break. >[35] In announcing its results, the SEC found that Gloss was not a participant in [Dai and Sutardja’s] backdating scheme.>[36] Marvell restated its financial results, and stated that Dai will no longer be executive vice president, chief operating officer, and a director but continue with the company in a non-management position.[37] The company agreed to pay a $10 million fine in 2008, but did not fire Dai nor replace Sutardja as chairman as stated by the investigating committee.[30][38]
Patent infringement[edit]
In December 2012, a Pittsburgh jury ruled that Marvell had infringed two patents (co-inventors Alek Kavcic and Jose Moura) by incorporating hard disk technology developed and owned by Carnegie Mellon University without a license.[39] The technology, relating to improving hard disk data read accuracy at high speeds, was reported to have been used in 2.3 billion chips sold by Marvell between 2003 and 2012.[40] The jury awarded damages of $1.17 billion, the third largest ever in a patent case at the time.[41] The jury also found that the breach had been "willful", giving the judge discretion to award up to three times the original damage amount.[40] In December 2012, the company lost its mistrial bid in this dispute.[42] Post-trial hearings were scheduled for May 2013 and Marvell reported to be considering an appeal in the interim.[39] In August, US District Judge Nora Barry Fischer upheld the award.[43] On February 17, 2016, Marvell agreed to a settlement in which Marvell will pay Carnegie Mellon University $750,000,000.[44]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
