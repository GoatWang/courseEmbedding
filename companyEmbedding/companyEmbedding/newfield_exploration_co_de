Governance





 We have created a culture where upholding the highest ethical standards is the right and only choice. We treat our stockholders, business partners and neighboring communities with integrity and respect.

At Newfield, our corporate governance principles directly align with our Business Principles and Core Values. These principles permeate our organization and promote a culture of excellence, integrity, accountability, adaptability, safety, environmental awareness, innovation and collaboration.













Board Oversight
Our Board of Directors (Board) plays a fundamental role in the leadership and governance of the Company. The Board oversees our operations and business affairs in an honest, fair, diligent and ethical manner driven by sound corporate governance principles and a commitment to corporate responsibility. The Board’s Governance guidelines are described in our annual proxy statement. 
Board Committees
The Board has four standing committees. Committee assignments can be found on our "Leadership" page and are listed in our annual proxy statement.







Ethics and Compliance
We have a reputation for conducting our business with honesty and integrity. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) is a testament of our commitment to these principles. Newfield has always believed in playing by the rules and doing the right things in our day-to-day business. The Code addresses these standards and provides guidance on Newfield’s expectations.
We continue to emphasize the importance of ethics and compliance through several company-wide awareness programs conducted for our employees. This past year, every employee completed the Code of Conduct recertification. We addressed 12 important topics during National Corporate Compliance and Ethics Week and through various email campaigns including:  



Harassment
Bullying
Insider trading
Conflicts of interest
Social media
Proper use of company assets






Ethical issues
Anti-trust
Respectful workplace
Protecting confidential information and company reputation
Gifts and entertainment




We regularly supplement our compliance activities to focus on specific risk areas. Over the past year, we stressed the Code’s ban on bribery and corruption through training for all employees. In addition, quarterly reminder communications and processes designed to prevent bribery and corruption were provided to our international employees.
Employees are encouraged to report concerns about any possible violations of laws, rules, ethics or the Code to any manager, human resources representative or officer within the Company. We complement this open door approach with our 24/7 Ethics Line, operated by a third party, for employees and others to report any suspected legal, regulatory or Code violations anonymously.
The Ethics Line also can be used to make concerns known to our non-management directors (members of Newfield's Board of Directors who are not Newfield employees) on a direct and confidential basis. Visit the Ethics Line website or call 866-593-5936. 











A CORE VALUE
We uphold high ethical standards and treat our shareholders, business partners and neighboring communities with integrity and respect. We play by the rules, do the right thing and allow the character of our employees to define us.

History








 2015



Our stock is up 20% over 2014 and for the second consecutive year, we are at the top of the list for E&P stocks in the S&P 500 Index. We are one of the best performers in all of energy. During a challenging year for the industry, we take proactive steps early on to ensure we maintain liquidity and preserve our balance sheet, and focus on holding our premier assets in the Anadarko Basin by drilling. A strong hedge portfolio and high-graded investments help to manage the collapse in commodity prices. We issue 34.5 million shares of our common stock and raise approximately $775 million in net proceeds—only the second time in a decade that we issued equity. Every focus area exceeds expectations with total production increasing approximately 23% over 2014.









 2014



We are the second best performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 Index and one of the best overall E&P performers. After five years of transformation, we are now focused on liquids-rich unconventional plays onshore U.S. Our proved reserves increase 14% with 96% located onshore U.S. The Anadarko Basin is our foundational asset comprising nearly 30% of our total reserves. Production exceeds expectations across focus areas and margins are enhanced through investment high-grading and cost cutting. We sell $1.5 billion in assets and use the proceeds to fund capital expenditures and manage short-term debt. Offshore China, we bring the Pearl field online. We  reduce our capital budget by 40%, issue $815 million in senior notes and replace existing higher cost debt. We upsize our credit facility by $400 million to $1.8 billion and extend its term by two years.      
 







 2013



Newfield celebrates its 25th silver anniversary. 
The Company accelerates domestic growth through the planned exit from its international businesses. Significant well cost reductions in core development plays help to drive efficiencies and deliver “top tier” performance. Newfield reaches an agreement to sell its Malaysian business for $898 million. The STACK play was unveiled and the Anadarko Basin was the Company’s fastest growing region.








 2012



Investments in our oil and liquids-rich developments allow us to grow and differentiate ourselves from our peers. More than 50% of our production comes from liquids. This oil focus includes the Uinta Basin oil plays of Utah, the Williston Basin of North Dakota, the Eagle Ford Play of Texas and assessment of our new position in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. 







 2011



A substantial portion of Newfield's $1.9 billion budget is oil-focused. The Company is growing its oil production and taking advantage of the price disparity between oil and natural gas. We expand our footprint in the oil-rich Uinta Basin to 280,000 acres. Additional plays are being assessed. Our corporate headquarters relocates to The Woodlands, Texas, in September.







 2010



Our capital budget is $1.6 billion with more than 70% allocated to resource plays, primarily in the Rocky Mountains and the Mid-Continent. We acquire more than 300,000 net acres in the Maverick Basin prospective for the Eagle Ford development. Newfield continues to focus on its oil assets with year-end oil production more than 20% over 2009. Newfield is named to the prestigious S&P 500.








 2009



We add more than 500,000 net acres in prospective resource plays and make a discovery in the Pearl River Mouth Basin of China. We enter the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania. Lee K. Boothby is named president and CEO, third in the history of Newfield. With a diversified portfolio positioned for future growth, the Company moves into its third decade of operation flexible and financially sound.







 2008



Production volumes continue to climb from Oklahoma’s Arkoma Woodford Shale and Monument Butte. A new oil field begins production offshore Malaysia and four successful deepwater discoveries are drilled, along with nine successful wells in the Williston Basin. Nearly 90% of Newfield's reserves are located onshore U.S. A robust 24% YOY growth was led by stronger than forecast volumes from the Woodford Shale, Malaysia, the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico.







 2007



We announce the sale of our GOM Shelf assets for $1.1 billion and UK North Sea assets for ~$500 million. We also announce a $578 million acquisition of assets in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. These assets provide an entry into many of the Rockies' most attractive exploration and development areas.  We close out the year with ~41 MMBOE in production.








 2006



Half our proved reserves are now located in longer-lived resource plays including Monument Butte in Utah, the Woodford Shale  in  Oklahoma and the Granite Wash in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. We drill more than 350 wells in the Mid-Continent and ~200 wells in Utah. At year-end, we are producing from four deepwater fields and preparing for production on our first operated development -- Wrigley. We commence production from two oil fields in China's Bohai Bay and prepare to bring the Grove Field in the U.K. North Sea and the Abu oil field in Malaysia on-line.







 2005



We replace nearly 300% of 2004 production with new reserves which are more evenly distributed among our focus areas. We make several significant  discoveries including Grove in the U.K. North Sea and Wrigley in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We initiate a  multi-year joint venture with a major oil company and gain access to 52,000 acres in South Texas where initial wells are successful. We drill nearly 200 wells in Monument Butte, and begin development of four fields offshore Malaysia and two fields in China's Bohai Bay. For the second time, Newfield wins the National Safety Award for Excellence.







 2004



We acquire the Monument Butte Field in Utah from Inland Resources for $575 million and establish a new focus area in the Rocky Mountains. We also set-up operations offshore Malaysia where the portfolio includes current production of about 10,200 BOPD (gross), exploration and development opportunities in shallow water and high potential exploration prospects in deepwater. We replace nearly 300% of our production with new reserves. Forbes Magazine names Newfield as one of the “Best Managed Companies in America.”








 2003



We announce a record $200 million exploration budget. We drill ~70 wells in South Texas and Louisiana—seven times as many as the previous year—and our first in the Oklahoma Arkoma Woodford Shale. In the deep shelf play of the Gulf of Mexico, we drill a significant discovery at West Cameron 73. We celebrate 15 years in business with nearly half our production coming from onshore fields, and end the year on a high note with production of 37 MMBOE—a 25 percent increase. 







 2002



We announce the purchase of EEX Corporation, which provides an asset base in South Texas and about 60 blocks in the GOM. Nearly half our production is now onshore. Excluding the acquisition, we added 181 Bcfe domestically, replacing 105% of domestic production. Including the acquisition, we replaced 255% of 2002 production with new reserve additions.  In the GOM, we drilled four successful wells and posted finding costs of less than $1.50 per Mcfe. We also make our first discovery in Bohai Bay China. 







 2001



 A $333 million acquisition of Lariat Petroleum establishes a new focus area in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. More than just properties, Newfield acquires a skilled team of employees with a track record of adding value. In the Gulf of Mexico, we make exciting discoveries at West Cameron 294 and Eugene Island 251. A year of extreme volatility in the energy sector, we  manage the instability by hedging our oil and gas production, shifting spending levels and curtailing production in periods of weak pricing. A share buy back program also is  initiated. 








 2000



The year was our best to date on virtually all metrics. Cash flow and production reached record levels. Newfield acquired three producing gas fields in South Texas for $139 million. This acquisition established the Company as a serious onshore player and represented our first step in asset diversification. Gulf of Mexico production increased 10% in 2000. David A. Trice is named the Company’s second president and CEO.







 1999



Two significant acquisitions are completed in the GOM, adding more than 170,000 net acres and new prospects. GOM production reaches record levels. We acquire two producing oil fields offshore Australia - our first international production. Production climbs to ~19 MMBOE, an increase of 28%.







 1998



We begin to diversify our asset base and extend our reach to onshore Texas and South Louisiana. We drill a significant discovery in the Broussard area near Lafayette. Newfield wins the prestigious National Safety Award for Excellence. Net production is up 20 percent continuing an uninterrupted string of production growth since 1990.








 1997



Our footprint continues to spread as we begin operations along the Gulf Coast and enter China. A $143 million acquisition in the GOM, a successful wildcat and four delineation wells lead to growth.







 1996



Newfield begins drilling activities offshore Louisiana at West Delta 152 and Ewing Bank 947 Fields. The drilling programs are successful and add significant new reserves. Production in these fields increase to more than 100 MMcfe/d.







 1995



 We drill four successful exploratory wells and two development wells.Our GOM production continues to expand following the installation of three platforms. Net production climbs nearly 20 percent to 17 BOEPD.








 1994



 Newfield drills five successful wells and installs a new platform and pipeline. Acquired in late 1993, Eugene Island 251/262 remains one of our most significant fields.







 1993



Newfield completes its initial public offering of common stock and goes public on the New York Stock Exchange at a split-adjusted share price of $4.38 - trading under the ticker symbol "NFX." 







 1992



Newfield has a history of adding value behind acquisitions. The acquisition of Eugene Island 181/182 results in a successful seven well drilling program and production tops 10 BOEPD.








 1991



We make our first operated discovery at Ship Shoal 157. A six well drilling program increases production to 4,500 BOEPD. Multi-disciplinary teams use “state-of-the-art” technology to analyze new 3-D seismic data on our fields.







 1990



Newfield purchases its first GOM property, Eugene Island 172. We participate in our first discovery, but after several dry holes, cash runs low. An infusion of $37 million from private capital institutions boosts spirits. Investors include Warburg, Pincus Investors, L.P., Yale, Duke and Dartmouth College.







 1988 / 1989



Newfield is founded by Joe B. Foster, former Tenneco executive, and 26 handpicked individuals. The plan: focus on the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The Company is capitalized with $9 million by an investment group led by Charles Duncan, the University of Texas endowment funds and Newfield employees. The Founding Business Principles are established—becoming the foundation for the Company’s future business strategy and success.

Lets Take Profitability As A Major Consideration: Newfield Exploration Company (NFX), The Allstate Corporation (ALL)

By Grady Hoffman -   July 25, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE:NFX) observed rebound of 4.71% since bottoming out at $25.46 on Jul. 07, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.89% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -34.17% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -46.68% from $50 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 12, 2016, but are collecting gains at -40% for the past 12 months.
NFX Target Price Reaches $40.47
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Newfield Exploration Company (NFX)’s shares projecting a $40.47 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Newfield Exploration Company (NFX)’s Sales Declined?
 NFX’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -3.3% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 46.8% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
The Allstate Corporation Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Newfield Exploration Company net profit margin for the 12 months is at -28.6%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 5.64%, and the sector’s average is 79.87%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -1.07% since hitting a peak level of $90.74 on Jun. 16, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 1.65% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 21.11% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 34.89% higher from $66.55, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 07, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 21.07% for the past six months.
Analysts See The Allstate Corporation 2.77% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for The Allstate Corporation (ALL) to grow. At recent closing price of $89.77, ALL has a chance to add $2.77 or 3.09% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($92.54) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.09 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, The Allstate Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly 25.4%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 14.85%, annually.
Is ALL Turning Profits into Returns?
 The Allstate Corporation (ALL)’s ROE is 11.63%, while industry’s is 9.18%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.81%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 The Allstate Corporation’s ROA is 2.15%, while industry’s average is 1.59%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.54. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

History[edit]
Newfield Exploration was founded in 1988 by former chairman of Tenneco Oil Company, Joe B. Foster.[3]
Through investments by Charles Duncan, Jr., the University of Texas at Austin endowment funds and the founding employees, the company was capitalized with $9 million.[3]
In 1990, Newfield purchased its first production property in Eugene Island Block 172 in the Gulf of Mexico. Through various workover programs in an attempt to increase efficiency, production of Eugene Island 172 increased from 0.2 million cubic feet per day (5,700 m3/d) to over 20 million cubic feet per day (570,000 m3/d) by the end of the year. Even to this day, Eugene Island 172 continues to produce.[3]
In November 1993, Newfield became a public company via an initial public offering of 3.125 million shares of common stock.[4]
In 1999, the company acquired Gulf Australia Resources Limited, which had assets in the Timor Sea, offshore from northern Australia.[5]
In 2000, the company acquired assets in south Texas for $142 million.[6]
In 2001, Newfield acquired Lariat Petroleum in a $333 million transaction, establishing a new focus area in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma.[7]
In 2002, the company acquired EEX Corporation and its asset base in South Texas in a $640 million transaction.[8]
In 2004, Newfield began operations in the Rocky Mountains with the acquisition of Inland Resources.[9]
In 2005, Newfield explored the South China Sea in a partnership with CNOOC.[10][11]
In 2007, Newfield announced the $575 million acquisition of exploration and development areas in the Rocky Mountains from Stone Energy.[12]
In 2007, the company sold its assets in the North Sea for $486.4 million.[13]
In 2009, along with Hess, the company leased land in Pennsylvania in the Marcellus Formation, but the company pulled out of those leases in 2013.[14]
In 2012, the company sold its remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore.[15]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Malaysia to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad for $896 million.[16] The sale resulted in a gain of $388 million.[2]
In 2016, the company acquired 42,000 acres in the STACK formation of the Anadarko Basin from Chesapeake Energy for $470 million.[17]
In 2016, the company sold its assets in Texas for $390 million.[18]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
In early 2012, Newfield discovered potential violations of the Clean Water Act relating to possible unpermitted discharges of fill materials into certain wetlands and drainages in the Uinta Basin. In 2015, the company resolved these issues with the Environmental Protection Agency and paid a fine of $175,000.[19]

In 1990, Newfield purchased its first production property in Eugene Island Block 172 in the Gulf of Mexico. Through various workover programs in an attempt to increase efficiency, production of Eugene Island 172 increased from 0.2 million cubic feet per day (5,700 m3/d) to over 20 million cubic feet per day (570,000 m3/d) by the end of the year. Even to this day, Eugene Island 172 continues to produce.[3]
In November 1993, Newfield became a public company via an initial public offering of 3.125 million shares of common stock.[4]
In 1999, the company acquired Gulf Australia Resources Limited, which had assets in the Timor Sea, offshore from northern Australia.[5]
In 2000, the company acquired assets in south Texas for $142 million.[6]
In 2001, Newfield acquired Lariat Petroleum in a $333 million transaction, establishing a new focus area in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma.[7]
In 2002, the company acquired EEX Corporation and its asset base in South Texas in a $640 million transaction.[8]
In 2004, Newfield began operations in the Rocky Mountains with the acquisition of Inland Resources.[9]
In 2005, Newfield explored the South China Sea in a partnership with CNOOC.[10][11]
In 2007, Newfield announced the $575 million acquisition of exploration and development areas in the Rocky Mountains from Stone Energy.[12]
In 2007, the company sold its assets in the North Sea for $486.4 million.[13]
In 2009, along with Hess, the company leased land in Pennsylvania in the Marcellus Formation, but the company pulled out of those leases in 2013.[14]
In 2012, the company sold its remaining assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore.[15]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Malaysia to SapuraKencana Petroleum Berhad for $896 million.[16] The sale resulted in a gain of $388 million.[2]
In 2016, the company acquired 42,000 acres in the STACK formation of the Anadarko Basin from Chesapeake Energy for $470 million.[17]
In 2016, the company sold its assets in Texas for $390 million.[18]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
In early 2012, Newfield discovered potential violations of the Clean Water Act relating to possible unpermitted discharges of fill materials into certain wetlands and drainages in the Uinta Basin. In 2015, the company resolved these issues with the Environmental Protection Agency and paid a fine of $175,000.[19]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
