Discovery Meeting
The goal of the first discussion is to figure out what makes you tick financially. You’ll cover seven areas: values, goals, relationships, assets, other advisors, contact preferences and interests. Your advisor needs to understand what matters to you most.
Investment Plan Meeting
Two weeks following the Discovery Meeting, you will  meet with your advisor to discuss your Investment Plan. Before making your final investment decisions, you’ll explore three areas: how much risk do you feel comfortable taking, what is your time horizon, and what is your required rate of return.
Mutual Commitment Meeting
Now comes the big decision – it’s time to make a commitment. We’ll formalize the relationship and the new investment plan.
45-Day Follow-up Meeting
A check-up meeting. We’ll organize all of your account paperwork, confirm that you’re comfortable with the relationship, and address any outstanding issues.
Regular Progress Meeting
To ensure that we’re staying on track and meeting your goals, we’ll review your progress on a regular schedule. Life happens, so we’ll use these meetings to make any minor adjustments to your investment plan.
 At TCI, the core of our client relationships is to ensure that one’s entire financial picture is considered upon design and implementation of his or her investment plan. This approach to wealth management considers not only investment consulting but also the advanced planning issues of estate planning and tax management, as well as wealth transfer and preservation.  We strive to deliver this expertise while maintaining a superior level of client service.

You are here: Home / About TCI / Our PhilosophyOur Philosophy
Our goal in serving our clients is to insure that each one has a successful investment experience. We have discovered in our many years of working with investors that it is not that difficult to have a successful investment experience. Historical data shows us that making a good investment is relatively easy. So why isn’t everyone successful? Because making a good investment requires the management of not only an individual’s assets but more importantly, their behavior. Most of us fail at one or the other. Perhaps we get excited and invest in a local start-up or a real estate limited partnership because our friends say it is sure to go up. Maybe we have made good investment decisions, but when markets get rocky, we panic and sell our diversified portfolio. The result in both cases is the same: A poor investment experience.
The realization of one’s dreams does happen in some instances by pure luck, however in most cases it is the result of a well thought out plan. Specific resources are deployed based upon solutions and strategies resulting in quantifiable success. Realizing success should never rest in the hands of chance or the results of short-term economic conditions.
This process does not happen overnight and is most commonly the result of years of careful thought, action and adjustment. This process must include a strategic balance between a client’s current or future living expenses and the assets that the client wishes to preserve for future generations or philanthropic purposes. A “one-size fits all” approach to goals, aspirations, and commitments is a sure recipe for disaster. Success is realized by executing a clearly defined set of strategies and solutions that result in fulfilling your promises to yourself, to your family, and to your legacy.
Our team of investment advisors specialize in helping our clients achieve their financial aspirations by helping them care for their financial well-being.

You are here: Home / About TCIAbout TCI

TCI Wealth Advisors, Inc. (“TCI”) was founded in 1990 with the fundamental principle of putting clients’ interests first through trusted, respectful, honest and open communication. With offices in Tucson, Scottsdale, Flagstaff, Reno/Tahoe, Santa Fe, Denver, and Santa Monica, TCI is one of the largest independent, registered investment advisory firms in the West.
TCI maintains all the best parts of a small firm while leveraging the benefits of a large firm. Our proactive process focuses primarily on client values, goals, interests, and desires allowing TCI to provide a complete financial solution – balancing wealth and well-being.
Independent and Fee-Only. TCI is committed to the practice of providing independent investment and financial planning advice. TCI is 100% owned by shareholders active in the firm, thereby allowing the company to steer clear of any conflicts of interest that may arise when a firm is owned by a company that has a proprietary product-based investment solution. TCI’s fee-only independence, combined with our long-standing relationships with other like-minded financial professionals, allows the firm to provide successful conflict-free and unbiased financial guidance, based solely on the needs and expectations of each client.
Evidence-Based Investing. Our investment philosophy is based on award-winning academic research and, when coupled with comprehensive planning, we believe it provides an effective solution to assist our clients in having a successful wealth management experience. We believe in a structured approach to investing which utilizes, low-cost and tax-efficient investment solutions.
100-Year Firm. TCI is committed to the concept of a 100-year firm; a company that will be around for not only our clients today but for their children and grandchildren into the future. Planning to meet individual and family goals includes focusing on future aspirations and generations. In 2012, TCI launched the ASPIRE program designed to provide younger people with access to sound financial planning and investment management. Historically, this type of service has not been readily available to this part of the population. TCI is committed to providing sound financial advice to you, your family, and the generations that will carry on your legacy.
Having recently celebrated our 25th anniversary, TCI serves over 1,500 clients and manages over $1.7 billion in assets. Our firm has been recognized in many different publications and rankings over the last few years and although we are very honored by these recognitions, we truly attribute all of our success and growth to our amazing group of clients. They have supported us over the years and we feel lucky to be able to empower, educate and advise them as they work towards their personal definition of success.
