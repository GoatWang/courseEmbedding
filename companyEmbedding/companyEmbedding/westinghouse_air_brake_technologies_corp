Good morning, and welcome to the Wabtec First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Wesley. Please go ahead.
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our 2017 first quarter earnings call. Let me introduce the others who are here with me in the room, Al Neupaver, Executive Chairman; Ray Betler, our President and CEO; Pat Dugan, our CFO; and John Mastalerz, our Corporate Controller. We'll be happy to take your questions after we make our prepared remarks. And of course, during the call, we will make some forward-looking statements, so we ask that you review today's press release for the appropriate disclaimers.
Al, do you want to get started?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter adjusted earnings were in line with expectations with growth in our transit business offsetting lower revenues in our freight business. We expect our sales and earnings to improve each quarter this year. And today, we affirm the guidance we issued in February. Ray and Pat will discuss our results and operations in detail shortly.
But before I turn it over to Ray, I'd like to comment about the progress we've been making on the integration of our acquisition of Faiveley Transport, an acquisition we completed only a few months ago. After completing the purchase of the family stake in December, we began a tender offer for the remaining public shares. By late March, we had acquired more than 95% ownership, which enabled us to move forward with a squeeze-out process to complete the transaction in late March.
As we said before, this acquisition represents the most strategic acquisition we've made today and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in the synergies. We now have a strong position in the global transit market that provides increased diversity of our revenue base across markets, across products and across geographies to offset the cyclicality of the U.S. freight market.
We also have a strong established platform of products and service capabilities in Europe and in Asia Pacific, the two largest transit markets in the world, with a full range of technologies to serve these as well as other global markets. Let me give you a little update on the synergy activities.
We estimate synergies to be about $15 million to $20 million in 2017, and we expect the long-term annual synergies of at least $50 million to be achieved by year three through revenue growth, through supply chain efficiencies, operational excellence and cost savings, and by leveraging our engineering and administrative capabilities.
In total, we're tracking more than a 100 synergy projects. We have active projects in every operational and functional area. We're generating early successes in sourcing new product development optimization, tax planning and in reduced redundant activities and resources. Work on longer-term synergies is also proceeding with a focus on facility consolidation, global and market expansion and new product development. So once again, just a few weeks into the integration process, we're pleased with the progress of – and excited with the long-term opportunities and benefits we expect to achieve.

I'll turn it over to Ray now.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thanks, Al. Financially, our performance in the first quarter met earnings expectations with an adjusted EPS of $0.84. Al will cover the adjustments later in his remarks. During the quarter, our backlog increased 2% compared to the fourth quarter backlog and our book-to-bill was 1.1, which is a positive indicator. We're still facing challenging conditions in some of our freight markets and we continue to reduce cost as necessary, although we saw freight aftermarket revenues increased for the second quarter in a row, which is another positive.
During the quarter, we purchased the remaining shares of Faiveley and made good progress on the integration. We acquired Aero Transportation Products, ATP, a manufacturer of hatch covers and outlet gates for freight cars with annual sales of about $40 million. We announced the signing of a $97 million contract to provide signaling and communication services to TEX Rail.
And then earlier this month, we acquired Thermal Transfer, a manufacturer of heat exchangers in industrial markets with annual sales of about $25 million. And we acquired Semvac, a European-based manufacturer of sanitation systems for transit vehicles with annual sales of about $15 million. So, we've been busy running the company day-to-day and making strategic investments for the future.
Based on our first quarter performance today, we affirmed our 2017 guidance. For the year, we expect revenues to be about $4.1 billion with earnings per diluted share between $3.95 and $4.15, excluding restructuring and transaction charges and non-controlling interest related to the Faiveley acquisition. The midpoint of the EPS range represents growth of about 6%, 7% compared to the 2016 adjusted results.
Due to the ramp-up of projects already in the backlog and the timing of synergies from the Faiveley acquisition, we expect our revenues and adjusted EPS to improve sequentially during the year, with more acceleration in the second half. Accretion from Faiveley will increase during the year as projects and synergies kick in.
Other assumptions include the following. Revenue growth for the year will come from our Transit Group with the Freight Group expected to be slightly down. Faiveley will be accretive, but its financial impact will be reduced by expenses for additional interest and a higher share count, along with purchase price accounting charges.
We're assuming foreign exchange headwinds of about $55 million at current rates. And our tax rate is now expected to be about 27.5% for the year. We're now assuming diluted shares outstanding of about 96 million for EPS calculation purposes, that's a bit higher than the 95 million we were previously assuming.
Our goals in 2017 remain the same as we discussed earlier in the year. Those goals are to meet our financial plan, to right-size our business and remain disciplined when it comes to controlling cost, to generate cash to invest in growth opportunities while strengthening our balance sheet, and to ensure smooth and effective integration process with Faiveley, and to capture the synergies and growth we expect.
As always, we will strive to control what we can and manage our business effectively. Our transit markets remained stable, both in the U.S. and abroad with new projects expected to ramp up this year, and good bidding activity to continue overall.
Reflecting this activity, our transit backlog remains at a record high. During the quarter, we won orders for air conditioning equipment in Sweden, brakes and couplers in Italy, brake systems in Dubai, and in particular, our orders for aftermarket services were strong, which certainly helps our margin outlook.
Over the next several years the strongest market growth is expected to be in Western Europe, Germany, France and the UK, as well as Asia Pacific, India and Australia, while talk of infrastructure-focused spending in the U.S. could also provide additional opportunities.

We're bidding on several significant future projects in the U.S., France and Australia, and expect to announce some of these project wins, as we go forward through this year. In addition to sales growth, we are focused on improving margins in transit. Many of the synergy projects that Al mentioned involve plans that we believe will drive significant margin improvement over time and we're committed to delivering on those plans.
Let's turn to the freight markets. In NAFTA, freight rail traffic is rebounding after being down for two consecutive years. Through mid-April, total traffic was up about 4%. As a result, we are seeing a slight pickup in our aftermarket business, and we should see more benefits as we go through the year if the rail traffic continues to improve. We see no change to our 2017 freight assumptions.
Railroad CapEx, which declined about 15% in 2016, is expected to be down again in 2017. Locomotives down about 6% worldwide, including down about 30% in NAFTA. Freight cars down about 10% worldwide, including about 30% in NAFTA. Combined, that represents a headwind of about $120 million in revenue.
We have opportunities still to offset most of these headwinds because of our growth strategies and diversified business model. Aftermarket in the U.S. and elsewhere, international projects in places like India, acquisitions we've completed in 2016, which will add incremental revenues of about $100 million through Graham-White, Unitrac, Pride Bodies, Workhorse are all positives to offset the headwinds.
We continue to focus on growth. Our priorities for allocating free cash have not changed, although we also expect to reduce debt during the year. So, our use of free cash will be to fund internal growth programs, including product development and CapEx, to pursue acquisitions, which are strategic and have ample opportunities to deploy capital in this area.
And thirdly, to return money to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock buybacks, our current share repurchase authorization program which still exists. So we remain focused on increasing free cash flow by managing cost and driving down working capital, controlling capital expenditures.
Our corporate strategic growth initiatives continue to be the same. We're focused on new products and technologies. We're focused on global expansion. We're focused on aftermarket expansion and on strategic acquisitions.
So let's talk about each of these. In the area of new products, we have always viewed our mission is helping customers to increase their safety, productivity and efficiency. So our future product roadmap is focused on just that, whether it's data analytics through electronics and sensors or train control automation using onboard computers. We have an extensive pipeline of innovation in both freight and transit around the world. We're also working on a number of green initiatives, which are environmentally-friendly product developments, such as charging systems for electric buses and ferries, low-energy consumption HVAC systems and a compact lower weight door mechanism.
On the global and market expansion front, for the quarter sales outside of the U.S. were $590 million, or 65% of our total revenues. Examples of recent orders include ECP brake systems, and other freight components in Australia, sensors in wayside monitoring equipment in India and pantographs in South Africa.
In the area of aftermarket expansion, sales for the quarter were $519 million, or 57% of our total. As I mentioned, we have started to see some slight pickup in our freight aftermarket business due to increased rail traffic in the U.S. If freight traffic continues, we expect to see more benefits.
Let's talk about train control and signaling. Train control and signaling remains an important part of our long-term growth opportunities, although it's part of the reason why our freight revenues were down in first quarter. In first quarter, revenues from train control and signaling were about $68 million. For the year, we expect them to be flat to slightly up.

We have been selected for several PTC projects in transit and hope to announce details of those soon, some of which are expected to begin later this year. Long-term, we expect PTC in signaling will be a growth business for Wabtec based on the following opportunities: multi-year maintenance and service agreements which include software and product enhancements, international projects, and continued growth in signaling through organic investment and acquisitions.
We're beginning to see some evidence that our long-term strategy is working. We signed a $97 million contract to provide signaling and communication services to TEX Rail, for a new commuter rail line in the Fort Worth, Texas area. We signed several maintenance and service agreements related to train control, but once again, our new product roadmap includes considerable activity in this particular product area.
On the acquisition front, our pipeline continues to be active and we're pleased with the opportunities we're reviewing. This year, so far, we've acquired Aero Transportation Products, a manufacturer of hatch covers and outlet gates for freight cars with annual sales of about $40 million, which increases our market share. Thermal Transfer, a manufacturer of heat exchangers for industrial markets with annual sales of $25 million, which provide synergies with our existing heat exchanger businesses. And we acquired Semvac, a European-based manufacturer of sanitation equipment and systems for the transit market with annual sales of about $15 million, which fits with our existing Microphor business here in the U.S.
So each company meets our strategic criteria either with new products, more geographical coverage or strong aftermarket opportunities.
So with that, I'd like to ask Pat to talk about some of the financial details.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Okay, thanks, Ray. So sales for the first quarter were $916 million, and when you look at the breakdown between the segments, Transit segment sales increased 72%, mostly driven by the Faiveley acquisition. Acquisitions contributed about $270 million of additional sales. FX was a drag, actually reducing our Transit segment sales by about $23 million and the rest was flat organic sales for the quarter.
Looking at the Freight segment, those sales decreased about 21%. We had lower organic sales mainly from PTC, from freight OE, and aftermarket businesses, that was down about $130 million, and it had a small FX impact of about $2 million and that was offset by some acquisitions of about $37 million positive. In a positive sign, freight sales were higher than the prior quarter for the first time in nearly two years. And if rail traffic continues to increase, we would expect that trend to continue.
Our operating income for the quarter was $115 million. This included transaction expenses of about $8.9 million related to the Faiveley acquisition. Of this, $3.4 million was a one-time purchase price accounting adjustment and included in cost of sales, and the rest is reflected in the SG&A line. If you exclude these expenses, operating income was $124 million and about 13.5% of sales. Going forward, we expect SG&A to be about $120 million per quarter. Engineering expense and the amortization were up mainly due to the Faiveley acquisition, and we expect similar run rates for the rest of the year.
Interest and other expense, which is a net number, was about $15 million for the first quarter, the higher interest expense was due to the borrowings for the acquisition. And going forward, we expect a similar run rate for interest and other expense, although we are focused on generating cash and reducing our debt and the related interest expense throughout the year.
Income tax expense, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%, and this included an expense of about $2.1 million for an adjustment related to the opening balance sheet for the Faiveley acquisition. Going forward, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be about 27.5%. And I always remind you that, that's an annual forecast, and our quarters may vary due to timing of any discrete items.

Just to help a little bit on the earnings per share and help you reconcile, just some more information here. Our GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter about $0.77. The effect of the restructuring and transaction expenses, the tax adjustment, and our non-controlling interest related to the Faiveley acquisition, reduced EPS by about $0.07. So adding that back, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.84.
Just to put some numbers and some to this. Net income per diluted share $0.77 in accordance with GAAP. You add back our one-time PPA in the cost of sale line, that was about $0.03. You add back the restructuring and transaction expenses in SG&A about $0.04. You add back our tax expense item, I referred to, that's about $0.02, and then a deduction because the non-controlling interest was actually a positive income item was $0.02, that reconciles to $0.84 on an adjusted basis.
So moving to our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong. It provides the financial capacity and flexibility to invest in our growth opportunities, as Ray outlined them, and just I always remind you that we have an investment grade credit rating, our goal is to maintain that rating.
Working capital at March 31, we had receivables about $704 million, inventories were about $704 million, and accounts payable were $565 million. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter $280 million, mostly held outside of the U.S., and our debt at the end of quarter $1.870 billion, and it consisted of $750 million of 10-year senior notes due in 2026; $250 million of bonds due in 2023; a $400 million term loan, that's a 5-year expiration, and then a – I am sorry, that's a 3-year expiration and then a revolver for $400 million, that's a 5-year expiration. Looking at the balance sheet, you can see that our net debt-to-EBITDA is about $2.7 million.
Just a couple of miscellaneous items for the questions we always get. Our depreciation for the quarter about $16 million, compared to $11 million in last year's quarter. For the full year, we expect depreciation to be about $65 million. Our amortization for the quarter $8 million, compared to $5.3 million in last year's quarter, and for the full year, we expect it to be about $38 million. And our CapEx for the quarter $19 million, compared to an $8.5 million. For the year, we're budgeting about $110 million, we tend to lag our budget a little bit every year.
Our backlog at the end of the quarter, we have a multi-year backlog, it was a record $4.1 billion, including $2 billion from Faiveley and our book-to-bill was about 1:1. The transit backlog was $3.5 billion, and freight $582 million. Our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multi-year backlog, was $2 billion, transit was $1.6 billion, and freight about $400 million.
So with those comments, I'll turn it back to Ray.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thanks, Pat. So to summarize, our first quarter earnings were in line with expectations, and we affirmed our guidance for the year. Even though we continue to face some challenging conditions in the freight market, we continue to stay focused on controlling what we can and on investing in growth opportunities.
We're pleased with the progress we're making on integrating Faiveley and on our synergy planning. We're confident that our diversified business model and our balanced growth strategies will enable us to respond to both long-term opportunities as well as short-term challenges.
And with that, we'll be happy to answer your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

The first question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.

Good morning, Allison.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
When we look at the revenue assumption for 2017 of $4.1 billion, I think last we spoke, you talked about potentially a low single-digit organic growth assumption embedded in that, based on sort of where we started in Q1. Are you still comfortable with that low single-digit or sort of the components of that $4.1 billion assumption change?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. We're still comfortable with that Allison. We're not surprised by the slow start for the year. We've just put it that coming into 2017. Our expectations are the freight traffic is going to continue to grow, and that we're going to pick up in the aftermarket area later in the latter part of the year. Second half was where our expectations were focused.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Most of the drag in revenue will still come from the transit area. Keep in mind that our transit projects as we tried to explain on the last call, a lot of these projects are queued up and we'll see revenue recognition getting greater in the second quarter and then with more acceleration in the third and fourth quarter.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. So, that's a good point what Al explained, that also means projects are three year to five year in length. So, you literally have those programs into revenue plan, and with the great backlog that we have and continue to build, that revenue stream will systematically build as a result.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, thanks. And then on the PTC and signaling, you still talked about flat, but you also noted a number of new contracts. So we assume there is a time early probably for 2018 and beyond, I mean, how should we think of the ramp of this, and I guess are you hearing any delays push up still in the near-term?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Well, actually, the phenomenon in the PTC and signaling area, on the signaling side, it's similar to what Al just described for transit projects. As you put those big projects there, three, four, five years in length to execute the first part of the project normally is relatively low revenue recognition because it's associated with the engineering. So, you don't start to get equipment revenues and delivery revenues until second and third year. So yes, those will start to influence us in terms of added revenue more in two to three year time period.
As far as PTC goes, the hardware actually buy (27:35) was up in Q1. I think that was fundamentally a pickup or a catch-up associated with the shortfall that existed in 2016. We expect most that the hardware for PTC to be bought out this year. There may be slight amounts left for 2018. The commissioning will – and integration will probably take place over this year and next year. So PTC, as you've known it, over the last four, five years, is going to change from hardware to maintenance and service contracts and enhancements. And then, we're going to get more and more of these – hopefully get more and more of these train control and signaling projects, which we continue to with.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you.

The next question is from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes. Please go ahead.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Yes. Just a follow-up on that last question on PTC, given the shift in mix from hardware to maintenance and service for 2018. Would you expect the overall revenues to be higher in 2018 versus 2017?

Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No. PTC, so let's take each component. PTC hardware will not be higher in 2018 and 2017. On signaling projects, then, they will continue to generate revenue. We're saying for this year, we expect the revenue to be about flat. Obviously, next year's revenue are going to be influenced by how many new projects we can win. We have several new projects that we're bidding on and we're relatively confident that we're going to win, so that will influence the revenue stream for next year.
In the MSA revenue we've booked, entered into contracts with the majority of the Class I's, there's still a couple left that we're negotiating with. And that revenue stream we'll build over time. In the first year it will taper up, it will grow and then it will reach annual flat revenue base which we've given numbers of about 5% to 10% compared to the installed base that we have on PTC hardware.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I think, it's awful early, it's early for us to really comment specifically on 2018. But I think it's important to note that this is really the focus not only for us, but it's really the focus of the freight and transit railroads around the world and that's to improve the safety, efficiency and productivity. And that's exactly what Ray talked about when he was talking about his roadmap, and that is that we see a lot of opportunities in the signaling area, in the onboard train control area, in the enhancements and ways of trying to take our installed base of the onboard computer and add features to that, that will help in the efficiency and the productivity for the railroads.
So long-term, this is definitely a growth area for us. It's a segment that we're really excited about and one of the areas that we will see growth. As far as specifically looking at 2018, we'll know more as the year goes on. But we're pretty sure right now based on the backlog and what projects we're aware of, that our sales should be flat from 2016 to 2017, and possibly even slightly up. We could win some more projects, and we could get them going.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
All right. That's helpful. And then looking at your forecast for your freight business for 2017, are you assuming that freight traffic continues to grow at around that 4% level or what are the expectations there? Thanks.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah, that's our assumption. We don't have any information to assume anything else. It seems to be fairly consistent. It goes up and down week by week, but it seems to be fairly consistent since beginning of the year.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. And it depends a lot on the comparison. I mean that number really is a comparison number. So what we are planning is that the volumes in the carloadings will improve as the year goes on. Whether that percentage does or not depends on the comparisons, whether they are tough or easier.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
And then finally, it sounds like you've got some positive early signs with the Faiveley acquisition. I was just wondering, if you've seen any material employee turnover, increased competition or any other short-term disruptions from the acquisition?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No, we have not. The integration has gone very well. We haven't seen any unexpected losses of key personnel or anything like that. I think people are pretty excited in all areas of our corporation about the future.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Sounds great. Thanks a lot.

The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Good morning.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Good morning.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Can we start just on Faiveley? Is there any way where you can give us a number for and how much revenue in the quarter was from Faiveley and maybe how much operating income or pre-tax income was from Faiveley? And then of the about $15 million to $20 million of synergies, how much you've realized so far?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
If you looked at the numbers that Pat gave, most of the increased revenues that we have in the transit area is coming from that acquisition. So, that comes out about $270 million or so. Other than that, the internal growth rate is, we had a flat business other than that and there was another small acquisition that's added to that number.
As far as commenting on the margins, we typically do not provide that and we're going to stay key (34:35) to that, you have to realize right now, there is a lot of different things happening. We're integrating businesses, so it's a complex analysis. We are in the start-up phase as far as getting and realizing synergies. You take advantage of some sourcing as I said, where we're trying to take a look at tax planning. We're getting synergies here. We're getting synergies as far as duplication of engineering projects. We've got some duplication of actual head count, and we're tracking all those.
We had about a 100 as I said, a 100 different synergy projects that we're tracking almost on a two-week to three-week basis, and we've got the whole team involved on it. Those synergies, the realization of them, it will take time and it will grow as the year goes on and into 2018, keeping in mind that we still think that after a run rate in the third year we should be at a $50 million synergy addition to our current business plan. So we're pleased where it's at, we've got a lot of work to do, and we're really pretty focused on a lot of different areas.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Just so I'm clear on the way you guys are talking about synergies, is the $15 million to $20 million a full-year 2017 number or a run rate synergies by the end of the year?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Full year.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay, okay. So...
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
(36:15).
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. From a full year guidance standpoint, I know you talk about a sequential ramp in earnings. And if you look at first quarter as a percent of a typical year, it implies something a good amount below your guidance. So, maybe it'd be helpful, at least would be helpful for me like, can you help us think about the sequential progression that you're thinking in terms of second quarter and then third and fourth quarter? And what kind of sequential earnings increases you're thinking about, just because the model is a little tough right now?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
We've never given quarterly guidance and we really don't want to do it. I think that the statements that we made is that we will sequentially get better with more acceleration in the second half. There is the business model has changed quite a bit. I think traditionally, we've only had, if you go back to history, the first quarter has always been a pretty good quarter, the second quarter was – very usually had seasonalization in the third quarter because of the European impact and the fourth quarter was going bank busters.
And we still expect to see a fall back in that third quarter because of the European effect from a general business level, but I don't think you'll see much different, and the fact that now we are a project-based business with large transit projects that we know are in our backlog and we'll kick-in as the year goes on. And that's the big change because as the models change, we were 60% freight business and the 40% transit business and it's flip-flopped.

Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay, okay. And then just last question, just going back to PTC, I sometimes go just confused with the numbers in terms of PTC versus total signaling. Can you give us the breakdown of like the $250 million of sales last year? How much of that was PTC hardware? How much was signaling? And then, maybe, what you're thinking for this year's PTC versus signaling, if that's the right way to break it down?
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hey, Scott. This is Tim. So last year, we did about $350 million in train control and signaling, that was about $250 million in train control and a little under $100 million in signaling. And what we will see then – and that's the extent of the breakdown, we're not going to get into the details of all the other different line items within those. And then this year, what we've said is, we expect that about $350 million for train control and signaling to be flat to slightly up. We could see the train control piece down a little bit and the signaling up a little bit.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And then the first quarter number that you gave of $65 million, I think was $65 million, what was that, was that a total signaling or just PTC?
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
It was $68 million and that's both, so that's train control and signaling, so that's consistent with the – about $350 million of those two that we did last year, total of last year.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. Thanks a lot for the time, guys. Appreciate it.

The next question is from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks, and good morning.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Justin.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Just wanted to ask first about transit revenue, it seem like it was a little bit light in the quarter relative to Street expectations. And I just wanted to clarify, was there anything that surprised you in the transit business year-to-date or as you talked about before, is this just a timing issue due to the projects that ramp more significantly over the next several quarters?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
There is definitely nothing that's surprised us, Justin. Again, we have these projects programmed in there, it's hardcore revenue, the only thing that would impact our forecast over the year would be if a project would get cancelled, which is extremely unusual in the transit market and/or delayed which is not unusual in the transit market. But once the project startup, normally the projects are not delayed in process. So the delays normally come at the front end of the project. So, you might delay revenue for transit projects case-by-case. So once those projects start to ramp up and generate revenue, it's pretty much continuous flow. And the project execution, again, really, if you get into the details of when these transit projects are very, very predictable. So all I can tell you is that we have to your point, to Scott's point, we have a very a detailed forecast and a revenue plan and it supports our expectations for the year.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, great. And maybe on those transit projects that are ramping, could you give some more color on whether those are OE related or aftermarket related or maybe a combination of both, just trying to figure out how that ramp in the top-line will kind of flow through to margins?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So the majority are OEs related and it's projects like German high-speed trains where we have brake stores, air conditioning. We have double deck trains in France where we have brake stores, air conditioning, auxiliary power supplies, pantographs. In France, we have brake stores, electronics. In the U.S. we have R179. We have PTC projects in the transit area which you're aware of. So there is a lot of OE, but we continue to build our aftermarket.

The beautiful thing about transit market, as we've talked before, is that once you have that installed base and we're expanding geographically, we're about to book some very significant orders in the markets I talked about. And once you have that installed base, you're there for 40, 50 years and that aftermarket business is good margin business. It's equal to the aftermarket margins in the freight side. So, what you're seeing on a top-line basis is dominated by only business, but we are building our aftermarket.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
That's helpful. And maybe one last question. Longer-term, I just wanted to get your view on the outlook for locomotive, and the locomotive and railcar cycles in North America. And if you think we're in a situation where we remain below replacement levels for multiple years, are there more aggressive restructuring or cost cutting efforts that you could start to deploy?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. So to be honest, Justin, we haven't stopped the cost cutting and restructuring efforts. So, you know that the freight car build is down as well as the locomotive build is down this year and down significantly. If you look at locomotives, I just had a meeting with the GE folks last weekend, we want you to forecast on a worldwide basis. We're talking about a significant drop, I mentioned 30% in my comments in this country, the build maybe only around 500 and worldwide maybe 600. So, and car builds down to 40%. Where it's headed, the GE folks I can tell you are focused on international. We're focused on international, that's a benefit of us expand in our geographical footprint over the years. Now, we can localize and support projects there.
So, as far as the trend goes on the freight car side, for this year, we still are looking at about 40,000, I think the build was 10,200 or something like that in Q1. And next year, the backlog there has been deteriorated. Next year, it could drop again, we've said that before, it could drop to 20, could drop to 30. Right now, we don't have enough visibility to predict that. But we're not anticipating freight car builds going up next year and we're not anticipating locomotive builds going up. So we're managing based on the facts we have in front of us which means we've got to cut costs and we got to continue to restructure our business and that's what we're doing.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.

The next question is from Saree Boroditsky of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just had a follow-up on the questions regarding guidance. So you maintain the guidance of around $4.1 billion despite the bolt-on acquisitions and then lower FX headwind. So, I just want to see if there's anything else that changed in your outlook that offset those.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No, the bolt-on acquisitions, they're relatively small annual revenue, but they're nice strategy acquisitions. Faiveley was – we closed last year, so it was in our plan already. So no, it's, again, we have a very detailed forecast that supports our revenue guidance.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess, there's still a fairly wide range in your EPS forecast. So I was just wondering if you could just help us understand what needs to happen to reach the higher end of that versus the lower end.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Okay. I felt badly for Pat, so I'm going to let him answer the question.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.

I think the guidance, the range on the EPS guidance really comes down to some of the seasonality and some of the revenue volumes when they hit, and lastly, just being cautious on the recovery in the aftermarket business for North America freight.
So, I think we've got a lot of moving – as the questions sort of have focused on correctly. A lot of moving parts, a lot of changes are occurring with the business. We're assuming some recovery in North America aftermarket business, and also some restructuring in synergies that are coming with the acquisition. So a lot of things moving, and so we're putting a range out there to be careful.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for answering my questions. I'll get back in queue.

And the next question is from Mike Baudendistel. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. Just wanted to see, can you provide any comments at all on the potential for Siemens Rail and Bombardier, merging? I mean, what impact would that have on you? Can you give us a sense for how big a customer is Bombardier or how big of a direct competitors is Siemens Rail, and any types of those comments would be great?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. They're both big customers of ours, and they're one of the big four. Big three being European at CRC, and the industry, one of the big four worldwide. We have no insight into what is going on, Michael one (48:59), between Siemens and Bombardier, other than what we read in the paper, rather there's been a lot of consolidation in the industry over four decades I've been in the industry and I suspect it's going to continue. So what those two decide to do in the end, we'll adjust accordingly. Bombardier, as you know, has been rumored to be combined with several other companies in the past. So this could just be rumors or superficial discussions, who knows? But we certainly have no influence or insights.
Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Got it. Thanks for those comments. Just also wanted to ask you – just on the income statement. You talked about interest expense and other income, you netted those amount, but if you look at them separately and it looked like the other income was a $2.3 million favorable impact that you really haven't had the last few quarters. And I was just wondering is that something that's sustainable or any specific reason for that?
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. When we do our guidance, we really are anticipating that, that's a relatively flat number, those are variety of things including gains from FX translation, gains and losses on foreign exchange. And so we have, on occasion, had losses – had income there. And so, just with the change, I mean, in some of the base currencies for us that we have a slight gain this quarter. So going forward, we're expecting it to be neutral and interest expense to improve as we bring cash and repay debt.

And the next question is from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah. Good morning, everyone.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Sam.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Good morning.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
So maybe just to start off with, can you talk a little bit about the business through the first 25 days of the quarter here, just 2Q trends across however you guys want to slice it across the segments, across the components of the segment. Just curious how the second quarter is looking for you?

Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. I think it's in line with what our guidance has been and I don't think there's been any big surprises, but clearly at 25 days we continue to focus on all the same things we have talked about, which is integrating the businesses and making sure we're hitting all our targets and so, on that I don't think there's lot more we could talk about.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
The only thing we'd say – we just have an awful lot of pending closure on orders right now. That's probably a positive and we're not seeing any drastically difference between the first and the second quarter. Just little pickup that we're seeing in freight carloadings, that continues, but there's nothing else that's drastically changing other than the amount of I think large projects that we're trying to finalize it.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's helpful. And maybe continuing on that line, can you talk about, you mentioned obviously aftermarket is starting to accelerate, is there a way to talk about within the first quarter, what the growth was within the aftermarket portion of freight?
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Sam, this is Tim, if you look at fourth quarter versus first quarter, we saw about $25 million of aftermarket revenue growth in freight from the fourth to the first, probably about half of that was acquisitions and then the rest was organic. So we have started to see some slight pickup there like we talked about.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
But still down year-on-year?
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yes. Yes. Still down year-on-year.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay.
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Comparing the first quarter of this year to first quarter last year, yes, still down.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. And maybe a few other housekeeping items. I think you went through a little bit before of the cash flow items. I don't know if you commented about what total cash from operations was in the quarter?
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Well, cash from operations was actually a negative, it was about $26 million negative. But that's so that you've got to adjust that number because an awful lot of our deal cost, which were accrued for in the fourth quarter were paid, okay, so when you back out the one-time items, it's about $30 million worth of deal costs that were paid in the first quarter that were accrued for at the end of 2016.
Now, then when you look at the normalized performance in terms of cash flow, we usually have first quarter is a challenge for us. On top of that, we have the normal things that get paid in the first quarter, some benefits and incentive-related accruals, tax, interest, a number of items. And so, we typically have our weakest performance in the first quarter and then, it improves throughout the year.
So nothing that I don't think is normal and we remain on our budget and plan for the full year, once you take into account the items that we paid for related to the acquisition.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's super helpful. And maybe just two other quick questions here. Just on your non-rail business, I think there's been a few pieces of M&A within the historical non-rail portion of your Freight segment, how was that performing throughout the course of the quarter? How is that performing versus the fourth quarter? Certainly, there's a lot of positive data points on general industrial market. So just curious what you're seeing on that non-rail business?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I think in the industrial business, non-rail business is improving. We're seeing some improvements in the elastomer and rubber business, we're seeing some improvements in the heat exchanger business. So I think in generally, it's trending along with the economy. So, it's not dramatic improvement, but we are seeing some slight improvement in those areas.

Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And if I can sneak one more in here, I'm sorry. Just on the 2016 versus 2017 for PTC, you commented that maintenance revenue is going to be growing really – for the software revenue is going to be growing. I'm curious as a percentage of that $350 million, what was it in 2016 and what are you anticipating for 2017? Thank you.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So the revenue in 2016 was – did we give a number? It's a relatively small number for 2016, Sam, because we were literally just booking those contracts. So, the contracts will ramp-up over a year period. And then will reach a steady-state. So, overall – we've given that number?
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Okay, overall this year – (56:29) you guys don't want me to be disclosing the details of the service agreements, but what will happen is we have two, three months service agreements to book. We're in the process of negotiating those. So, throughout the course of this year, we'll reach a steady state on the service agreement. So service agreements are fixed – basically fixed fees agreements with opportunities then for enhancement revenue, which will be incremental.
So, the fixed fee opportunity is 5% to 10% of our installed base that we talked about before. And then what we're trying to concentrate on now is we're going to generate enhancement opportunities. So there's upgrades and other things but data analytics and software enhancements, productivity improvements or we're speaking with the Class I's.
And then longer term comes the, the focus on our product roadmap that I talked about. And that focus really, if you look at, it's out 5, 10 years, you know our focus is on fully automated railroads.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
It could be just a relative number, we expect that particular line item, of all the – if we add them all up to be there's – almost three, four times what we were – three or four times than we accomplished in 2016. So, it's significant, yeah.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. That's super helpful, guys. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you.

Good day and welcome to the Wabtec fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Wesley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Timothy R. Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Let me introduce the other Wabtec team members who are here with me, Al Neupaver, our Executive Chairman; our President and CEO, Ray Betler; Pat Dugan, our CFO; and our Corporate Controller, John Mastalerz. We'll have our prepared remarks, and then of course be happy to take your questions. Certainly, during the call we will make some forward-looking statements, and we just ask that you review today's press release for the appropriate disclaimers.
Al, go ahead.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone.
As you know, 2016 was a very challenging year for Wabtec due to the recession in the freight rail market and sluggish conditions in many other industrial markets. In this environment, we are focused on controlling what we can and on investing in growth opportunities. With that in mind, 2016 was also a year of tremendous accomplishments for Wabtec. I think we'll look back on it as the year that we took steps to position our company for a new era of growth and performance.
So let's talk about those accomplishments. Financially, although we did not meet all of our 2016 targets, we did compile some of the best results in our history and generated significantly more cash from operations than net income. Operationally, we reacted aggressively to our challenges by cutting cost. Strategically, we acquired majority ownership of Faiveley Transport, which has strengthened our diversified business model, expanded our global footprint, and added new products and technologies to our portfolio.
Before I turn it over to Ray, I'd like to say a few words about the integration of Faiveley and what it means to our company. As most of you know, we have been interested in acquiring Faiveley for many years, and we were finally able to come to an agreement in mid-2015. Throughout 2016, we spent countless hours dealing with regulators in the U.S. and Europe, and we received the necessarily approvals to move forward in the fourth quarter.
On December 1, just 12 weeks ago, we announced the purchase of Faiveley's family stake. And in late December, we began a tender offer for the remaining public shares. That process is ongoing, and we hope to achieve our goal of at least 95% ownership in the first quarter of this year. There is no doubt that Faiveley represents the most strategic acquisition we've made to date, and we're very excited about the growth opportunities we can pursue together.
Faiveley's strong position in the global transit market provides increased diversity of our revenue base across markets, across product lines, across geographies to offset the cyclicality of the U.S. and global freight markets. The company has a particularly strong platform of product and service capabilities in Europe and Asia-Pacific, both of which are much larger markets than the U.S. Thanks in part to its geographic diversity, Faiveley generated organic sales growth of about 5% in 2016. Faiveley strengthens our innovation and technology initiatives and brings products that Wabtec has not been able to offer such as high-speed brake for door and door systems and HVAC equipment.

The company also brings a strong and experienced management team to complement our existing organization. Over half of Faiveley's revenues are project-based and backlog-driven, which provides long-term stability and visibility. And finally, we believe the combination of Wabtec and Faiveley will result in significant synergies to drive our growth synergies and cost improvements.
We estimate synergies of about $15 million to $20 million in 2017, and we expect long-term annual synergies of at least $50 million to be achieved by year three through revenue growth, supply chain efficiencies, operational excellence and cost savings, and by leveraging our engineering and administrative capabilities.
Here are just a few examples of synergies we're working on. Sourcing, combined we have spend of more than $2 billion annually, which gives us leverage with suppliers. By optimizing our product portfolio and new product development, where we offer similar products, we will select the best that each company has to offer in each geographic market and we'll eliminate redundant product development costs.
From an internal supply standpoint, Wabtec currently manufactures some products such as rubber and castings that Faiveley purchased from outside suppliers. Now they will be buying from Wabtec. Facility consolidations, there are numerous opportunities for manufacturing and office consolidations. For example, Faiveley's existing Indian plant will be used to meet localization requirements for contracts that Wabtec has won, which means we do not have to invest in a new plant there, a savings of more than $5 million in capital. In all, we're tracking more than 100 synergy projects and seeing positive interaction and cultural integration among the teams.
So once again, just 12 weeks into the integration process, we're pleased with the progress so far and excited with the long-term opportunities and benefits we expect to achieve.
I'd like to now turn over the presentation to Ray.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thanks, Al.
I'd like to mention one more reason for our excitement. Two weeks ago, we held our first annual leadership conference for the new Wabtec. We brought together the top business leaders in our company. About half the participants this year were from Faiveley. It was very gratifying to see the two executive teams come together and focus on our conference theme, Stronger as One. I think we're off to a really good start.
Our business leaders shared ideas for new products. They shared best practices and disciplines, such as quality and Lean. We discussed new acquisition targets and we explored cultural differences and ways to overcome them. We have no illusions. This integration will be complex, but we're committed to exceeding our synergy targets and to making Wabtec a stronger company for all of our shareholders.
With that, let's talk about the current state of our business in our markets. So first we'll focus on fourth quarter 2016. During the fourth quarter, we not only purchased the majority ownership of Faiveley, but we started the tender offer process and began the integration of two other recent acquisitions, Workhorse Rail and the Gerken Group. We completed also a $750 million senior notes offering, and we continued to manage through a challenging downturn in the freight market.
Overall, our financial performance in Q4 did not live up to our expectations, with sales of $760 million and adjusted EPS of $0.81. There were several factors that affected our performance. Sales were about $20 million lower than we expected and product mix was unfavorable. For example, revenues from train control and signaling did not meet our sales targets. We added sales of about $100 million from Faiveley, which were dilutive to operating margins.

Integration costs and activities related to Faiveley were significant and they did create distractions throughout our organization. As usual, we also booked some year-end adjustments, none of which were significant individually. On the positive side, we did generate strong cash from operations of $202 million and our backlog increased 10% compared to the third quarter, even excluding the Faiveley backlog of $1.9 billion.
Throughout 2016, our management team responded to difficult market conditions with aggressive actions to reduce our costs. These actions enabled us to maintain good adjusted margin performance for the year within 100 basis points of 2015 despite an 11% drop in sales.
We reduced total plant employment by more than 10% during the year and we continue to adjust that as necessary going forward. We made further cuts in discretionary spending at corporate and across all business units when we stepped up our efforts associated with the Wabtec excellence program which includes lean, supply chain initiatives and quality initiatives.
Let's move to 2017 guidance. Today we issued our guidance for the first time. For the year, we expect revenues to be about $4.1 billion with earnings per diluted share between $3.95 and $4.15. Excluding restructuring and transaction charges and non-controlling interest related to the Faiveley acquisition, the midpoint of the EPS range represents growth of about 6% to 7% compared to 2016 adjusted results.
Due to the ramp up of projects already in the backlog, and the timing of synergies from the Faiveley acquisition, we expect our adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2017 to be similar to the adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2016. And we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half.
Accretion from Faiveley will increase during the year as projects and synergies kick in. Other assumptions include the following. Revenue growth for the year will come from our Transit Group with the Freight Group expected to be down slightly. Faiveley will be accretive but its financial impact will be reduced by expenses for additional interest and a higher share count along with purchase price accounting charges.
We're assuming foreign exchange headwinds of about $65 million at current rates. Our tax rate is expected to be about 29.5% for the year. We're assuming diluted shares outstanding of about $95 million for EPS calculation purposes. But our goals for 2016 are straightforward, to meet our financial plan, to rightsize our business, and remain disciplined when it comes to controlling cost, to generate cash to invest in growth opportunities while strengthening our balance sheet, and to ensure a smooth and effective integration process with Faiveley to capture the synergies and the growth that we expect. As in the past, we strive to control what we can.
So, let's talk about the freight rail market. In NAFTA, freight rail traffic was down about 5% in 2016. In the first few weeks of this year the numbers are slightly better with traffic up about 2% on average. We're are not seeing yet any benefits from this as customer inventories of aftermarket parts remained lower than normal levels and equipment storage rates remain high. If rail traffic continues to improve. We do expect to see benefits in our aftermarket business later in this cycle, perhaps in the second quarter or third quarter.
Our 2017 freight assumptions include the following. Railroad CapEx, which declined about 15% in 2016, is expected to be about the same in 2017. Locomotives will be down about 6% worldwide and about 30% in NAFTA. Freight car builds will be down about 10% worldwide and about 30% in NAFTA. Combined, that represents a headwind of about $120 million in revenues.
We have opportunities to offset these headwinds because our growth strategies and diversified business model allow us to focus on the aftermarket in the U.S. on international projects in places such as India, on acquisitions that we've completed in 2016 which will add incremental revenue of about $100 million. Those acquisitions include Graham-White, Unitrac, Pride Bodies and Workhorse.

We also remain focused on increasing our global footprint and our product offering beyond our traditional NAFTA aftermarket because about 75% of our installed base for locomotives and freight cars are outside of the U.S. Our transit markets remain stable both in the U.S. and abroad with good bidding activity overall. Reflecting this activity, our transit backlog is at a record high for legacy Wabtec business and Faiveley's backlog is near record high.
Over the next several years, the strongest growth is expected to be in Western Europe, Germany, France, UK and Asia-Pacific, specifically India and Australia while talk of infrastructure-focused spending in the U.S. would also provide additional opportunities.
Current projects include brake stores and HVAC equipment for high-speed trains in Germany; brakes, auxiliary power supply, HVAC, couplers, pantographs for regional and commuter trains in Belgium; brake stores, electronics for the regional network trains in France. And we're bidding on significant future projects such as subsystem and component business, maintenance for commuter trains in Sydney, Australia, as well as subsystems in commuter component projects for the New York City acquisition, which is forthcoming.
In addition to sales growth, we are focused on improving our margins in transit, both in the legacy Wabtec business and the Faiveley business. Many of the synergy projects that Al mentioned involve plans that we believe will drive significant margin improvements and we're committed to delivering on those plans.
We continue to focus on growth and cash generation. In 2016, we generated $449 million of cash from operations, which gives us ample capacity for investment. Our priorities for allocating free cash have not changed, while we continue to strengthen our balance sheet.
First, we would fund internal growth programs including product development and CapEx. Second, we would focus on acquisitions where we have ample opportunity to deploy capital. And third, we would return money to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock buybacks. In May, we announced a dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year, and during 2016, we purchased 3,046,408 shares of our common stock for about $212 million or about $69.63 per share. We have about $138 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.
We remain focused on increasing free cash flow by managing our costs, by driving working capital down, and by controlling capital expenditures. Our growth strategies remain the same. They are global and international market expansion, aftermarket expansion, new product development and technologies, and acquisitions. So, let's talk about each of these strategies.
On the global expansion side, for the quarter, sales outside the U.S. were $450 million or 59% of our total. We're particularly excited about growth opportunities in India, where we have orders for brake systems and event recorders for locomotives, and Faiveley has several orders for doors, brakes, and air conditioning equipment for various transit projects and bidding activity there continues to be strong.
In France, after years of flat or declining volume, the bidding activity is very strong, including the largest commuter project ever in Europe for RER regional fleet, which includes 240 high capacity trains. Aftermarket expansion sales there for the quarter were $433 million or 57% of our total. Gerken, one of the 2016 acquisition companies, recently won two multi-year contracts to supply its aftermarket carbon products in China and in Germany.
And, then, on the new product side, we introduced several new products last year. We built a new plant in China to build intercoolers for the power generation market. We introduced the new generation of sintered brake pads for high-speed rail. We developed bogie-mounted brakes specifically for the South African market and Faiveley has a new NeoFlexx brake disc which they've introduced to the market.

Moving to train control and signaling, control and signaling remains an important part of our long-term growth opportunities. Although, it's part of the reason why our freight revenues were down in 2016. As you know, our customers were working hard to implement PTC but decreases in freight rail traffic caused the railroads to reduce their CapEx budgets for both infrastructure and rolling stock. In addition, the deadline extension to at least 2018, resulted in changes in their spending plans.
The result of all that are the revenues from train control and signaling decreased 30% in 2016 to about $350 million. We expect that to be flat to slightly up in 2017. Long term, we expect PTC and signaling will be a growth business for Wabtec based on the following opportunities. Multi-year of maintenance and service agreements, which includes software and product enhancements, international project opportunities and continued growth in signaling through organic investment and acquisitions. In 2016, we acquired a small but very strategic signaling company in the UK to allow us to focus on growth in that market.
We're beginning to see evidence that our long term strategy is working. We've signed several maintenance and service agreements related to train control, including the 10-year contract in Brazil to provide a variety of train control and signaling services.
On the acquisition side, our pipeline continues to be active and we're pleased with the opportunities we're reviewing. In addition of Faiveley, during the fourth quarter, we acquired Workhorse Rail, which is a supplier of engineered freight components, mainly for the aftermarket. The company has annual sales of about $35 million. Workhorse supplies freight car couplers, knuckles and related parts for a variety of Class I railroad and freight car options.
Workhorse offers a variety of product designs and sells primarily in the North American market, that brings an excellent reputation and strong engineering capabilities in new products to our portfolio. In addition, we believe Wabtec's geographical presence in aftermarket footprint, will provide new opportunities to expand Workhorse Rail's customer base in North America and around the world.
So with that, I'd like to ask Pat to talk a bit about some of the financial details.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Okay. Thank you, Ray. So, everybody, I'm going to go through our normal review, but also spend a little bit of time on the adjustments just to help everybody with their math and their models and understanding what actually was recorded in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
So sales for the fourth quarter were $760 million. And when you compare this to a year ago quarter, that includes a negative effect of about $22 million from changes in foreign exchange rates. If you exclude that FX impact, sales would have been about 6% lower than the last year's quarter. And this decrease can be attributed to the difficult market conditions in our Freight segment.
Our consolidated sales figure included about $100 million from revenue with a dilutive impact on EPS, including lower margins and higher interest costs. When you look at our segments, from a year ago, the freight sales decreased about 32%. That's mostly due to lower organic sales mainly from PTC, from freight OE, and aftermarket, about a $174 million impact. Negative FX, which is about $3 million, which in those two items more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions, which would have added about $17 million of revenue.
Our Transit segment sales increased 26%. The acquisition of Faiveley and others contributed about $120 million of revenue to the segment. That more than offset lower organic sales of about $14 million and negative FX of about $19 million.

Operating income for the quarter was $63 million, and this included the following: transaction expenses of about $26 million related to the Faiveley acquisition; some adjustments for contracts and restructuring expenses of about $15 million. And if you exclude these expenses, our operating income would have been about $104 million or about 14% of sales. Most of these expenses were included in SG&A in the quarter. So that's the main reason why it's so much higher than the year-ago quarter. Going forward, our run rate for SG&A is expected to be about $130 million. Our engineering expense was down slightly and our amortization was up mainly due to the Faiveley acquisition.
So I'd like to repeat what Ray said earlier, that our adjusted operating margin for the year was 17.6%, and that's less than 100 basis points lower than 2015 despite the drop in sales. That's a good performance in a difficult market.
Looking at interest and other, interest and other expense was $30 million in the fourth quarter, and this included $22 million of debt refinancing expenses and additional interest costs incurred from the delay in closing the Faiveley acquisition. Going forward, we expect quarterly interest expense to be about $16 million. But be assured, we are focused on generating cash to reduce that number going forward.
Interest (sic) [Income] tax expense was actually a tax benefit in the quarter due to two items related to the Faiveley acquisition. First was an expense of about $9 million as certain transaction costs become non-deductible and we have to make an adjustment in our tax provision, but then we also had income of $27 million reducing a deferred tax liability.
We had discussed the expense, the $9 million expense, with you in December. The income from the reduction of the deferred tax liability occurred late in the fourth quarter after we had already completed the purchase of Faiveley. We were required to reduce the amount of the deferred tax liability that we had set up on the opening balance sheet because of changes in the statutory tax rate in France. We expect the 2017 annual effective rate to be about 29.5%. And I always want to remind everybody that's an annual forecast. The quarters will vary due to timing of any discrete items.
So focusing on the fourth quarter EPS, earnings per diluted share were $0.42. The effect of all the items that I had discussed and the $9 million non-controlling interest expense related to the Faiveley acquisition reduced EPS by $0.39. So our adjusted EPS is $0.81. So just to bridge you from the $0.42 to $0.81, we start at $0.42 of earnings per share in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. You add back about $0.21 of transaction expense. That would show mostly in our SG&A line about $26 million, contract adjustments and restructuring expenses, mostly recorded in the cost of sales line, about $0.12. You add back additional interest and other expenses of about $0.17. And then we deduct the net tax benefit of the two adjustments that I referred to earlier, that's about $0.20, and the minority interest about $0.09, and that gets you from $0.42 to $0.81.
So going through same exercise for the full year, our earnings per diluted share were $3.34 and the effect of all the items I discussed and the $9 million of non-controlling interest related to the acquisition reduced EPS by about $0.51. So our adjusted EPS was $3.85.
So again, I'll just bridge you from $3.34 to $3.85: $3.34 is our Generally Accepted Accounting Principles number; transaction expense and SG&A about $0.31; contract adjustments and restructuring costs $0.13, mostly in cost of sales; additional interest and other expense about $0.17; the benefit of the net tax adjustments about $0.19; and the minority interest of about $0.09. That gets you to $3.85.

Okay, to talk about our balance sheet, it remains strong and it provides financial capacity and flexibility to invest in the growth opportunities we discussed earlier. We have an investment-grade rating for our credit rating, and our goal is to maintain it. Our working capital at the end of the year included trade and unbilled receivables about $943 million. Inventories were $659 million and payables were about $530 million.
At the end of the year, we had almost $400 million in cash, mostly held outside the United States. Our debt balances at the end of the year, our debt balance was about $1.9 billion. And that consists of the following: a $750 million bond offering that we had entered into in 2016 due in 2026; $250 million of bonds that are due in 2023; a bank term loan of $400 million; and about $400 million outstanding on our revolver.
When you look at the balance sheet, if you just do a simple calculation from our balance sheet at the year end, our net-debt-to-EBITDA is about 2.5 times – 2.7 times, I'm sorry. But if you do a kind of a full pro forma, it's lower, it's below 2.5 times. And then when you look at what we expect to do in 2017 with our cash generation that we expect to be below 2 times. So lots of strength on our balance sheet, lots of capacity and helps reassure everybody that we're going to maintain that investment grade rating. Cash from operations, we generated about $202 million for the quarter and that brings to about $449 million for the year. That exceeds our net income of $313 million, so a strong performance and in line with our goals.
So, just a couple of miscellaneous items we always review. Our depreciation was up $14 million compared to $11 million in last year's quarter, and for the full year, we expect it to be about $65 million. Amortization expense was $6.6 million compared to $5.7 million in last year's quarter, and we expect it to be about $35 million for the year.
Our CapEx for the quarter $19 million compared to $16 million a year ago, and for the year, about $50 million compared to $49 million in 2015. In our budget, and we always budget and tend to spend a little bit less than this, but we're budgeting right now for the combined organizations to be about $110 million for 2017.
Looking at our backlog, at December 31, our multiyear backlog was a record $4 billion, including $1.9 billion from Faiveley. Even if you exclude Faiveley, our backlog was up about 10% in the fourth quarter. Transit was $3.4 billion. Freight was $576 million. Changes in FX rates reduced the backlog by about $65 million compared to the end of 2015.
Our rolling 12-month backlog, which is a subset of the multiyear backlog was about $2 billion, transit was $1.6 billion and freight about $400 million. The total backlog figures don't include about $170 million of pending orders and contract options. We don't count them in the backlog until the customer exercises them.
So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Ray.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thanks, Pat.
So to summarize, as Al said at the beginning of our call, we had to deal with some very difficult and challenging conditions in our freight and industrial markets in 2016. But we stayed focused on controlling what we can, while investing in growth opportunities. We still face some of these challenges in 2017 and we'll continue to attack our costs aggressively, while driving our growth opportunities. We expect to get back on track as a growth company here this year in 2017, based on current market conditions and our existing strong backlog of projects.
We're pleased with the Faiveley acquisition and the progress we're making on integration and synergy planning. We're confident that our diversified business model and balanced growth strategies will enable us to respond to both long term opportunities as well as short term challenges.

And with that, we'll be happy to answer any of your questions.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks and good morning.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Justin.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
So, hi, how are you? So looking back on 2016, obviously, results missed expectations and I totally understand it's been a tough demand environment to battle. But especially with the month of December being so far below expectations, could you just comment on your visibility and confidence in the outlook for 2017 and as you do that I'm also curious if you've changed your methodology in terms of forecasting the business based on what we saw last year?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
The methodology has not changed. We have a very detailed bottoms-up methodology that we use for forecasting and we're basically analyzing that on a week-by-week basis to make sure that we have as a good visibility as possible, Justin.
I think the Q4 results were disappointing. We had issues that that we had to address some on our contracts. We had a few contracts where we had to take contract adjustments and the freight business did not recover. The electronics business did not recover. We didn't expect it to.
But we were trying to negotiate some MSAs that we were hopeful would develop revenue opportunities sooner than they did. So it was a host of issues that resulted in the shortfall. I think on lot of those issues were one one-time unique issues that we addressed and we think that the forecast for 2017 and the guidance is solid.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, great. And maybe to build on that a little bit looking at the 2017 guidance, could you talk about what you're assuming for organic growth in the Freight segment and also what's you are assuming for organic growth in the Transit segment?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
And, so, we're expecting overall, as I said, about 6% – 7% Freight. We expect to be basically flat to slightly down. We will monitor very, very closely obviously, the aftermarket opportunity. Our opportunity in Freight to a large extent it's going to be dictated by how fast we start to derive benefits from traffic. If traffic continues to pick up then, again Q2 – Q3 we should start to see some of the benefits from that.
We know that on the OEM side that car builds are going to be down. We do anticipate some growth opportunities on the international side, but overall, we expect traffic to be down. Transit organic growth about 5% over the year is what we anticipate and if you analyze the backlog in Transit both on Wabtec and the legacy Faiveley side, it's again, basically, a record high and we continue to pick up new orders. The project – the good thing about the project business is it is pretty predictable and we anticipate improvements in revenue throughout the year.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay, that's really helpful. And I guess, lastly, when you look at the business, just on an organic perspective, what are you assuming for the change in operating margins in 2017? Do you think, knowing the environment you just described from a top line perspective, margins will improve?
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Justin, this is Pat. So I think what you're going to see, just due to the way the year should progress that we'll get to about a 15% operating margin by the end of the year. That is in line with what we discussed earlier. Clearly, the overall margin is impacted by the higher mix of Transit sales from Faiveley acquisition. So there's going to be a steady improvement in margin throughout the year. We expect to execute on the synergies and the other integration plans and so we'll also see benefits from that too.

Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I might add that the one thing that you might ask, you look at December and we had a pretty good view. I just want to point out that because of the antitrust reasons, we really did not have a good view of the Faiveley business and how it would roll out during 2017. We assumed a lot about an equal business across, but the way they did a lot of completion on some projects in the fourth quarter, and our Faiveley business will really start out slow during the beginning of the year, and these projects will start kicking in as the year goes on. And they're in the backlog, they're planned, and a lot of these projects you do percentage completion type accounting, so we have good visibility on this.
This is not like our Freight business, which is a component business that you have much better equalized sales, but you don't have the visibility as much as we do, and that's really the strength of this diversified business model and the strength of the Faiveley acquisition. And as Pat points out, these synergies, they will build up as the year does and that's one of the reasons, we said we'll start out slow and be stronger in the second half of the year.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
That's helpful, Al. Lastly, Pat, I just want to clarify on the operating margin comment, you said around 15% all-in, but would you be willing to share what the year-over-year change is or what you expect in terms of the organic margin profile of the business?
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah, I think I would rather – let's just stick with the kind of the overall group, the combined margin and because the organic growth, I mean the organic margin, I don't see that really changing but I think we need to do a little more in analysis to make sure that we have that for you.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for your time today.

Our next question comes from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah, good morning, everyone. So just on the PTC asset here, PTC was down and PTC and signaling, I believe was down about a $150 million year-over-year based on that 30% decline. Can you talk about which buckets between signaling and kind of core onboard electronic PTC, how much of those were each declining? And then is there any change in the mix expectations for your flat guidance for 2017?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So Sam, on PTC, PTC hardware was down because capital spend was down. So we anticipate that this year the Class Is will buy after remainder of the PTC hardware. On the signaling side, we had one of the reasons we missed Q4, we had a pretty significant drop. It was actually a delay, a cancellation, but it's anticipated to come back in 2017. A delay in one of the major projects. It is associated with PTC, but we were doing signaling construction on that project. So it was for us, the scope was signaling category.
So about $250 million of PTC last year out of the $350 million total train control and signaling was the revenue mix. So the signaling really was pretty constant at about $100 million 2015 to 2016 and the drop was in the PTC part of it.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. That's helpful there. And then where you called out these contracts adjustments and, certainly, it was a decent size headwind this quarter, is there a way to get a final point on what specifically these contract adjustments are? Are there cost overruns that are going on? Are you taking lower margins on longer term contracts because I don't know there are issues with it? I just wonder to have a better understanding of where these are being impacted, which segment, what specifically, any kind of greater details that you can give us on that would be great.

Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. The contracts were really associated with the overall delivery performance problems, Sam. They're very different – there were three contracts that were in different industries and different geographical markets, but for the most part they were associated with cost overruns unit due to supplier problems in two cases and basically late deliveries and all that.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Maybe just one last one. Are there any – you guys called out the synergies for 2017, but are there any additional cost saving actions that we need to be mindful of> I think this year there was pretty significant cost savings. So is there anything else that we should be mindful of entering next year in order to get to you roughly a 15% EBIT margins for the full year?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
We're going to continue the initiatives that we had last year. So, we'll continue to try to proactively as much as possible adjust our discretionary spending. So that includes all our expense items, travel and the like head count things like that as well as the synergy programs. So the synergy programs are very explicit. We have over 100 DTL programs with people responsible to deliver on those programs. We managed those on a day-to-day basis, but we have a unconsolidated meeting on a monthly basis.
So, we have very good tracking mechanisms visibility and our focus is to accelerate those as much as possible, look for additional opportunities to add to that portfolio and to deliver on the ones we've already defined. And they're across the board, across the world, across every business. Every business unit leader, every functional leader has a target with specific projects associated with their responsibility.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And, Ray, just to follow up on that, is there any number that you can put behind the 2016 cost saving on the discretionary items? Thanks and I'll hop back in queue.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I'll let Pat chime in.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I've got to say that that's a little – we get that question a bit. I think the reality is that until we got to the fourth quarter and we had done a very good job of maintaining a margin with dropping revenue, and so those cost-saving initiatives in 2016 really are reflected in that improved margin. There was no one specific program initiative. All we did was we were constantly focused on identifying variable costs related to the volume change, but also being mindful of taking fixed cost out that would allow us to maintain that margin. So going forward, as Ray said, the real focus is on these synergies and integration opportunities we have, and we'll continue to do the same thing with the changes in volume.

Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group. Thanks for the time. Going to your...
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Ivan.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning. Can you provide a little bit more detail on your updated guidance? You lowered your revenues by about $100 million from $4.2 billion to $4.1 million (sic) [billion]. Can you put that into which bucket is that in, what product lines, what segments? Is that all freight?
And then a similar question on the earnings guidance, where that's also been lowered from your original preliminary guidance in December as well. Are you seeing higher expenses in certain cost bucket? A little more color would be great.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.

Okay. As far as the revenue job, that's associated with a host of things. It's associated with the Freight market certainly, but also things like FX and other cost-related items. As far as the second part of the question, can you repeat It?
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Yes. Just similarly, are you seeing higher expenses in certain areas that prompted you to lower your earnings guidance from your preliminary projections in...
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No, we're focused, as we said, on reducing expenses, driving down our overall SG&A and our costs and continuing to improve our margins. It's really about all against reduced revenues that we're trying to fight.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Got you, okay. Secondly, can you describe the current acquisition pipeline both in the U.S. and internationally? Are certain markets a little more active than others? And I just want to get a sense of what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
We have still a very healthy pipeline. The pipeline is strong both in North America and internationally. One of the benefits of the Faiveley acquisition is they obviously have their own acquisition candidates. So we're now including those in our overall portfolios as we consider prioritizing acquisitions. So we have both international as well as domestic and Freight as well as Transit.

Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Allison.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I just want to go back on the positive train control and signaling comments. I think you mentioned flat to up slightly. Obviously, the biggest headwind was on the PTC side. What's changed? As we go heading towards the 2018 deadline, I would assume that would ramp up. Is there a piece, whether it's system, design or something that's not coming back to where you thought it was? Just help me understand that a little bit.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I think for 2018, they're going to basically have to catch up in 2017 and 2018, and it has to be more loaded towards 2017 because by the end of 2018, the requirement is basically that all the equipment be installed and ready for commissioning. So there is about 20% – 25% of the hardware that they still have to buy, and we expect that most of that is going to get bought out this year.
Relative to the signaling side, a lot of infrastructure work has been completed, but they did pull back significant on the infrastructure. And then on top of that, we have new opportunities that we're booking for commuter lines and other railroads. So there is some pickup in new business associated with new projects as well as the completion associated with the existing PTC procurements.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I know the aftermarket piece is a bit new, but it sounds like you're getting some maintenance agreements and so forth in there. Is it tracking where you thought it was, a little bit more, a little bit less, any color there?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So there were delays a little bit, Allison, honestly again another impact on last year's revenue. We were hoping to negotiate and close those earlier in the year. It was a long, protracted negotiation in most cases. Railroads are very good at what they do and we have most of the Class I's under contract now. So those start off slow, low. And as the PTC implementation continues, they'll ramp up. And the contracts are negotiated basically at the level that we thought they would be. We said 5% to 10% of the hardware OEM equipment level, and that's about where we're going to end up it looks like. We're pretty happy with the way the negotiations went once they were finished.

Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Agree. And then just last on Faiveley, are you – => I guess would a low to-mid-single-digit organic growth assumption be the right way to look at it in terms of your visibility for this year for them?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Overall, we think organic growth, low to mid-single digits is about where we think we'll be.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you, good morning. Could you provide some more color on the performance of the industrial business, and then just how you are thinking about that into 2017?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Sure. On the industrial business, we're not seeing any significant improvements in Industrial. It's pretty much similar to Freight. We're hopeful that that will change, but at this point we're not seeing any significant changes.
On the other hand, we do have growth opportunities associated with industrial through the new product development and geographical extension that we talked about. So that intercooler project represents growth. We have businesses like industrial controls businesses in Australia and other places in the world that serve the power distribution and power generation market. So, I think we're forecasting a flat market for industrial similar to what we are at Freight but there are improvement areas that will offset the continued depressed areas that you see in this country.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you, that's helpful. And then just going back to the guidance, is the implied ramp in earnings, is that just due to Faiveley projects and synergies, or is there anything else that we should be thinking about?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No, I think it's a total mix of our business. We're going to continue to manage our improved profitability in all of our businesses as we always do. That comes through our focus on cost improvement, on Lean, on reduced cost, support quality as well as the backlog that's associated with and the mix associated with Freight and Transit. Aftermarket business is strong, working to grow the aftermarket business in both of those areas to more OEM business you get in Transit to more aftermarket business, you have a 30 – 40-year life. So it's a mix across the entire business that margin generation.
Patrick D. Dugan - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yes, you are right. I mean, the two things are going to be the major factors is the project phasing that again we did not have the visibility of back in December. And, the second thing is, as we generate the synergies through the year, those are going to be the major contributors, but as Ray points out, these aren't the only two factors and we do have a tremendously diverse business model now that really provides us with the opportunity to deal with large headwinds. Think about the headwinds that we're going to be faced with, just FX and our headwinds from the Freight business in the U.S. both rail car and locomotive. So, I think that really speaks to the strength of our business model.
Saree Boroditsky - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, that's very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Yes. So I wonder if you could discuss what your expectations are for ECP in 2017?

Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
If you're referring to the regulation, it's being contested. We don't anticipate that issue is going to get resolve, Jason, this year. But I think it's going to continue to be debated and we haven't forecasted any revenue associated with ECP in the U.S.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Right. And how about the outlook for raw material cost? Are you seeing any beginnings of increases there?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So for our raw materials cost, basically, only about 6% of our total spend is associated with raw materials. We have indexes under contracts for each of the raw materials copper, aluminum, steel, et cetera. Some of the raw materials that are going up are offset by raw materials that are going down like rubber, glass, wood. So bottom line is we feel pretty comfortable that we're going to be able to manage any raw material inflation across our business for the year.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
But most importantly, we had either indices or surcharges with our customers and we also have fixed pricing with our suppliers.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
And where we're renegotiating those contracts to drive both fixed prices down frequently.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
And can you remind us what percent of your total sales are derived from freight OEM currently?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
You mean, freight car and locomotive OEM?
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Correct.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Less than 10% of the business is related to new freight cars and locomotives in North America.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
All right. And then, just final housekeeping question, would you happen to have the shareholders' equity balance in the quarter?

Our next question comes from Matt Brooklier of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So I had a question around Faiveley synergies. I believe the $15 million to $20 million of synergies you anticipate to capture this year, that's up from your previous expectations. Maybe if you could just talk to what's changed why you believe you're going to be able to capture, roughly I think twice the amount of synergies that you've formally anticipated in 2017?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
That number really is basically the same and it's a gross number. We still have costs that are associated with that. And as we go through the year, we've already had, I can't tell you how many meetings we've had that's been concentrated on a program. We have a full time individual that's devoted to it. As we develop our synergy program, maybe the next call Ray and Pat could provide a lot more color and visibility on it. But right now, this is the best we have, is a gross number between $15 million and $20 million of synergies. But I think someone I know – I think I'd mentioned that we're tracking over 100 different projects right now.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. So the number hasn't changed, it's just the $15 million to $20 million of growth.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
No, it's the same.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
You're anticipating some there's cost offset that gets you back on to the, I think, it's like a net $8 million to $10 million.

Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Exactly.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay, that helps. And then just broadly speaking, of the $50 million of total targeted synergies., could you talk to how much of that is related to cost and maybe how much of it is potentially related to some revenue synergies that you could capture with the combination of the business?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I think that's an excellent question because I think long term that's really where the synergy is, is how we capture market share and grow our volume. I mean that's the whole reason, that's really the most profitable way to grow and we're really focused on it. There is some of that in the $50 million, but you have to be realistic about the acquisitions and ability to do that. We first have concentrated and focused on getting the integration, get the teams culturally combined and focused on the right thing. So, that will probably not be something you would expect in 2017, but beyond 2018 and 2019, it should start to grow, and that really is our long-term synergy, the main reason we keep saying this is the most strategic acquisition that Wabtec has ever done.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. So just to clarify, the majority of the $50 million at this point in time are more focused on the cost versus the sales synergy potential?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
I don't know how you define majority, but yes, most of them (1:03:33) add-on cost and not on growth.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
I'm just trying to get the confidence level in terms of hitting that number.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
And then...
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. I've always classified them as hard synergies and soft synergies, and typically this revenue is a soft one.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then do you – for fourth quarter, do you have the breakout in terms of PTC revenue, how much of it was Freight and how much of it was Transit?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
75% was freight, roughly.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. And then just lastly, you talked about, well, actually Ray mentioned, I wanted to clarify something that at this point in time, you've already signed the Class I rails into contracts for PTC maintenance and services. Moving forward, is that – did I hear that correctly?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. Most of the Class Is are under contract, yes.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. And the expectation is revenue from those contracts are expected to ramp as their systems go live, so probably expecting kind of minimal contribution from those contracts in 2017, is that a fair way to think about it?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yes, that's right.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay, that's helpful.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
They'll will ramp up to a steady state this year, Matt.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. And again, just to clarify, 5% to 10% of total revenue on – I guess on the equipment side of things for the class ones, that's a fair way to think about, the total annual maintenance and services to the revenue moving forward?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
So we've said 5% to 10% of our PTC hardware the installed base that is out there.
Matthew S. Brooklier - Longbow Research LLC
Okay, thank you for the time.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.

Thanks, Matt.

Our next question is a follow-up question from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey, sorry. Just a quick question here. Just on organic growth, there were a bunch of numbers that were thrown around. I thought, Pat, you said 6% to 7%, but then you also said flat to down on Freight and up 5% Transit. So, just help me kind of square. What are you guys expecting for organic growth in 2017? If you could put a number on it, that would be great?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. I think the confusion is around how much acquisitions play in that, whether you include Faiveley or not. The overall volume is up tremendously but internal growth is low to single-digit growth.
Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.
All right. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Okay.

Our next question comes from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate all the detail...
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Hi, Steve.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
...on the call so far. I just wanted to ask one a little further out. If you do look forward a few years to the point where the integration is well underway and we have say a stable to modestly growing freight market. Do you have a thought on what consolidated operating margin will look like given the new mix?
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
The only thing I would say is, if you take a – if you step back and you take a look at the Faiveley business and we've identified in three years $50 million of synergies, one could easily just add that to their current position and you would have an indication on what their margin might look like. And I think, Pat, the challenge would be the margin question about our base business even under the volume demand to maintain those margins as they have within that percent. I think that long term, we should be able to maintain our high margin business in the traditional Wabtec businesses. So that would give you an idea and that's just looking at it from 20,000 feet.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Understood. So fair to say as you go towards the end of the decade that you would think there's a couple hundred basis points of improvement from the 15% full year that you're talking about right now. Is that timeframe realistic?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. Yeah.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
All right. That's all I had today. Thanks.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thanks, Steve.

Our next question comes from Kristine Kubacki of CLSA. Please go ahead.
Kristine Kubacki - CLSA Americas
Good morning, guys. A question, a little bit longer term on the acquisition strategy now, it sounded like and I get the complexity of this deal was the largest you've taken on and you made the comment about distraction. It sounds like from a financial capability, it is no problem to continue with the acquisition strategy. But where we're at with Faiveley, do you think that there is still bandwidth within management to continue at pretty aggressive acquisition strategy over the next couple of years given what's on the plate with Faiveley still?
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. I think Kristine, Faiveley brought a tremendously strong management team with them. Stéphane Rambaud-Measson has done an excellent job pre-acquisition to come to Faiveley to address some performance issues and improvement opportunities and he was well along on a transition put in place a strong management team around him and those folks are a good part of the people that are running the Transit business worldwide today.

So they have certainly their own relationship experiences and acquisition candidates that they brought with them and I personally have already participated in three different acquisition visits with folks from a Faiveley legacy, Faiveley executive team. So yeah, they're a fundamental part of our organization now. We look at them as part of us. We don't say they and we anymore. And we have plenty of capacity, probably more capacity than we had before definitely more reach.
Albert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Yeah. And I'd add to that is, what I'm think, focuses is the integration and the synergy related to the acquisition. And as Ray mentioned in his prepared remarks, he said we're not having delusion that this is going to be a slam dunk easy acquisition. So the question is a very valid one and one that we take serious.
And I think that when you look at where we're at in the integration process on this, from my years experience, I think we're kind of where we thought would be. I think the biggest hurdle was still one of cultural integration. And I think we'd be careful in going ahead with a huge one, although we have the capacity. I think you worry about resource allocation. You worry about attention to details. But I don't think we're years away from that. I think we're months away from that point.
Kristine Kubacki - CLSA Americas
Okay. And that's very helpful. Thank you very much, guys.
Raymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.
Thank you.

For the second quarter the company reported net sales were $932,253,000 compared to $723,601,000 for the same period a year ago. Income from operations was $113,701,000 compared to $133,284,000 for the same period a year ago. Income from operations before income taxes was $96,729,000 compared to $127,086,000 for the same period a year ago. Net income attributable to Wabtec shareholders was $72,025,000 compared to $90,485,000 for the same period a year ago. Basic and diluted net income attributable to Wabtec shareholders was $0.75 compared to $1.00 diluted per share for the same period a year ago. CapEx for the quarter was about $19 million compared to $11 million a year ago. Cash from operations was $14 million. 
 
For the six months the company reported net sales were $1,848,287,000 compared to $1,495,632,000 for the same period a year ago. Income from operations was $228,559,000 compared to $275,465,000 for the same period a year ago.

Diluted net income attributable to Wabtec shareholders was $1.52 compared to $2.02 for the same period a year ago. Year-to-date, it actually used cash, resulting in about a $14 million of cash from operations. 

Compared to the first two quarters of the year, Wabtec expects modest improvement in its third quarter results and a stronger fourth quarter with an adjusted operating margin target in the fourth quarter of about 15%. 

For the full year 2017, based on the revised timing of sales and projects already in backlog, market conditions rebounding slower than expected, and the expected ramp-up of synergies from the Faiveley integration, Wabtec updated its guidance as: sales are now expected to be about $3.85 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share is expected to be between $3.55 and $3.70 excluding expected restructuring and transaction expenses, and non-controlling interest related to the Faiveley acquisition. Previously, the company expected full-year sales of $4.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.95 to $4.15. The company expects that the effective tax rate for the rest of the year to be about 27.5%. The company expects to have a spend for capital expenditures of about $80 million for the year. It expects depreciation to be about $65 million.

1 - Event Recorder
Meets and exceeds FRA, IEEE, GM/RT and EEIG crash protection standards
Today's rail transportation industry is more dynamic and complex than ever before. Rail transport companies are rapidly adopting high-tech solutions to help manage and maintain their fleet. Event data recording is a very effective solution that has been deployed throughout the rail transportation industry. Recording vehicle data is essential to operating and maintaining safe and efficient vehicles, and providing an effective health monitoring system.
 
Recorded data provides vital information for accident investigations, train handling studies, fuel conservation, vehicle performance, and preventative maintenance programs.
 
 Bach-Simpson™ Event Recorders are engineered for maximum flexibility, meeting your immediate needs while allowing for future expandability. Bach-Simpson Event Recorders are complimented with a Windows® PC software package for service personnel to download and graphically analyze data from the Event Recorder.
 
A typical Bach-Simpson Event Recorder system is capable of monitoring and recording discrete frequency, analog voltage, digital input signals and Train-line network communications, as well as controlled outputs and optional features to support features that include a Train Monitoring (Alerter) System for operator alertness, remote download capability, speed display, auxiliary light control, horn sequencing, and various other control and monitoring functions.
 
The internal Crash Hardened Memory Module (CHM) meets or exceeds the latest FRA and IEEE 1482.1 crashworthy requirements for event recorders. This Crash Hardened Memory Module protects data from the most extreme conditions; Fire, Shock, Crush and Volatile Liquids.
 
 The Train Monitoring System (TMS) or Vigilance/Alerter can be integrated within the event recorder, to ensures operator vigilance at all times. The TMS examines the engineer's control handling actions and will automatically bring the train to a stop should the engineer become incapacitated or unable to perform normal duties.
 
The Auxiliary Light Control consists of 2 sets of relay contacts for independent control of the Left and Right Auxiliary Lights. The operation of the two ditch light control outputs is user programmable for the auto mode flashing trigger source (Bell, Horn or both) and flashing rate and hold period timing parameters.
 
The Horn Sequencer responds to a single operator’s command to an external horn control relay, for providing the appropriate horn sequence activation.
 Electrical Specifications:
Compliant to EN50155
Nominal Voltages: 110VDC, 74VDC, 32VDC, 24VDC
Reverse polarity, over voltage and transient protected (±4,000 V @ 80j)
Isolated signal inputs to IEEE1482.1
Environmental:
Compliant to EN50125-1
IP54 with IP67 Crash Hardened Memory
Operating -40C to 85C (-40F to 185F)
 Other Technical Data:
Crash Hardened Memory Module meets or exceeds FRA, IEEE, GM/RT and EEIG crash protection standards
Records discrete frequency, analog and digital channels. Provides multiple control outputs
Train network and communication compatibility (MVB, Ethernet, RS232/422/485, CAN, LonWorks)

2.6 x 3 Truck Pulling Turbocharger
While the 2.6 x 3 is a pure competition charger, some light street use is not out of the question due to the smaller 3” turbine wheel and the T4 footprint. This is a great option for someone who is just getting into pulling and may not have all the supporting mods to run a big charger or someone who wants to drive the truck on the street every once in a while. Keep in mind that an upgraded fuel system is still a must for this charger.
 PTE's 2.6 x 3 Truck Pulling Turbocharger features the following:
Exclusive Competition Engineered Aerodynamics (CEA®), CNC-machined 2618-forged aluminum compressor wheel
Air-cooled, dual ceramic ball-bearing center housing rotating assembly (CHRA) for reliability and performance
Greater efficiency than other aftermarket units
Easier to stay on top off it due to the ball bearings and the CEA® turbine wheel.
Capable of higher boost pressure with less heat
Map Width Enhancement (MWE) cover
Turbine housing options:    -T4 divided .98 A/R with 4” OD (outer diameter) V-band discharge    -T4 divided 1.12 A/R with 4” OD (outer diameter) V-band discharge    -T4 divided 1.28 A/R with 4” OD (outer diameter) V-band discharge
Standard units are built to PPL 2.6 rules
Custom units are available upon request (just send us a copy of the class rules)
 
Precision Turbo and Engine has been building championship and record setting Chargers for over twenty years and knows what it takes to put you in the sand pile.






 


2.6 x 3.6 Truck Pulling Turbocharger
The 2.6 x 3.6 is the largest of the three PTE 2.6 chargers and it makes the most power. Multiple dynos have confirmed that it is a good 60 hp over our competitors’ best product. This is not a street friendly charger and is for high level competition only. Increased converter stall speed is recommended for automatics to light this charger as well as at least 5,000 rpm off the line for the manuals. The 2.6 x 3.6 is purpose designed and manufactured from compressor wheel to turbine wheel for competition purposes. It is not a reworked OE turbo; every part is engineered to work with the next as a complete turbocharger assembly. Champions like Brandon Overmyer relied on our technology to secure the 2012 ITPA 2.6 championship.
 Optional Guillotine/Air Horn Assembly Available
 PTE's 2.6 x 3.6 Truck Pulling Turbocharger features the following:
Exclusive Competition Engineered Aerodynamics (CEA®), CNC-machined 2618-forged aluminum compressor wheel
Exclusive Competition Engineered Aerodynamics (CEA®), inconel turbine wheel.
Air-cooled, dual ceramic ball-bearing center housing rotating assembly (CHRA) for reliability and performance
Greater efficiency than other aftermarket units
Easier to stay on top off it due to the ball bearings and the CEA® turbine wheel.
Capable of higher boost pressure with less heat
Map Width Enhancement (MWE) cover
Optional integrated guillotine valve and air horn that offers a smooth transition from the air horn to the compressor wheel.
Turbine housing options:    -T5 .96 A/R with 5” OD (outer diameter) V-band discharge (ideal for 5.9 Cummins)    -T5 1.08 A/R with 5” OD (outer diameter) V-band discharge (ideal for 6.6 Duramax)
Standard units are built to PPL 2.6 rules
Custom units are available upon request (just send us a copy of the class rules)
 
Precision Turbo and Engine has been building championship and record setting Chargers for over twenty years and knows what it takes to put you in the sand pile.

Acquisitions Drive Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp's Revenue Higher
The rail products and service provider affirmed its full-year guidance.

After more than a year of waiting, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB), or Wabtec, finally closed its acquisition of Faiveley Transport during the first quarter, which provided a noticeable boost to revenue. However, earnings didn't track that increase since the deal added some restructuring and transaction expenses, which when combined with weaker sales to freight customers, caused earnings to slide. That said, despite continued freight weakness, the company remains on track to hit its full-year guidance.

What happened with Wabtec this quarter? 
The Faiveley Transport transaction was the story this quarter:

Thanks to the Faiveley deal, revenue within the company's transit group jumped 72% to $568.1 million, which more than offset a 21% drop in freight group sales as a result of lower train control related equipment and service revenue and lower industry deliveries for new freight cars and locomotives. In addition, foreign exchange headwinds continued to impact results, cutting $25 million off the top versus last year's first quarter.
This year has been a busy one for Wabtec on the strategic front. Not only did the company finally close the Faiveley Transport acquisition this quarter but it also acquired Aero Transportation, which has $40 million in annual sales. Meanwhile, the company signed a $97 million contract to provide signaling and communications services to a new commuter rail line in Fort Worth. Finally, the company completed two additional acquisitions after the quarter closed, buying Thermal Transfer and Semvac, which had annual sales of $25 million and $15 million, respectively
Several factors impacted earnings during the quarter, including weaker freight group sales. In addition, the company had $8.9 million in restructuring and transaction costs related to the Faiveley deal, which sliced $0.07 per share off the bottom line. Meanwhile, interest expenses rose sharply as a result of the incremental debt needed to complete that transaction while the share count, likewise, increased due to that deal.






What management had to say 
CEO Raymond Belter commented on the company's results by saying that,

Our first quarter adjusted earnings were in line with expectations, and we expect improvement during the year. As we work to integrate Faiveley and our other recent acquisitions, we are managing our costs aggressively based on market conditions. We continue to invest in our balanced growth strategies and expect to benefit from our diversified business model and rigorous application of the Wabtec Excellence Program.

While Belter notes that rail market conditions have been challenging, there have been some green shoots of optimism in 2017. Railcar maker The Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:GBX), for example, recently reported expectation-beating fiscal second-quarter results. Furthermore, Greenbrier CEO William Furman noted in the earnings release that "We are encouraged by the upward trend in rail traffic, order activity in our current quarter, and earnings contribution from our activities in international markets." Meanwhile, industrial giant GE (NYSE:GE) noted some positives in the rail market on its quarterly conference call. GE's CFO Jeffrey Bornstein stated on the call that "Domestic market dynamics were slightly more positive, building on the modest improvement we saw in the fourth quarter." However, he did caution that "Although these signs of improvement are important, they're off a weak base and, as of yet, have not signaled a consistent trend." The said, GE did report robust orders in its transportation unit, with equipment orders rocketing 500% thanks to 37 new locomotive orders, including 24 in North America, which was the first order of this type it has taken since 2014. 
Looking forward 
Given those positives in the market, Wabtec remains confident in its full-year outlook. The company continues to expect revenue of around $4.1 billion and earnings between $3.95 to $4.15 per share, excluding restructuring and transaction expenses. Driving this outlook is the company's backlog, which has several projects ramping up later this year, as well as the expectation that it will capture between $15 million to $20 million of synergies from the Faiveley deal by year-end.

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp Rides Its Latest Acquisition to Higher Revenue
The rail products and service provider tapped the brakes on its full-year guidance due to a slower-than-expected rebound in market conditions.

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB), or Wabtec, continues to feel the impact of its recent acquisition of Faiveley Transport, which is providing a revenue boost while dragging down earnings due to additional costs. However, those costs weren't the only items affecting the quarter, as a slower-than-expected ramp-up of some of its projects along with a similarly slow rebound in market conditions also weighed on results. Those factors led the company to revise its full-year guidance.

What happened with Wabtec this quarter? 
The Faiveley Transport transaction continues to have a significant impact:

Sales in the company's transit group soared 80% to $587.4 million thanks primarily to the acquisition of Faiveley Transport. That deal more than offset a 13% decline in sales in its freight group, which fell to $344.8 million due to lower revenue from freight car and locomotive components as well as the slower ramp-up of certain projects. In addition to that, foreign currency headwinds lopped another $15 million off the top line compared to the year-ago quarter.
The weaker sales in the freight group along with $9 million, or $0.05 per share, in additional restructuring and transaction expenses relating to the Faiveley deal impacted earnings. In addition to that, interest expenses rose to $15.4 million in the quarter, up from $5 million in the year-ago quarter due to the incremental debt the company took on to close the transaction.
Wabtec closed two additional deals during the quarter, buying Thermal Transfer and Semvac, which had annual sales of $25 million and $15 million, respectively
The company booked several new orders during the quarter, boosting its multiyear backlog to $4.5 billion, which is up 10% from the first quarter. These new orders included more than $350 million of transit projects in Europe and Australia and $60 million in train control and signaling projects in the U.S.






What management had to say 
CEO Raymond Belter commented on the company's results in the second quarter:

We remain confident in our future growth opportunities, even as we manage aggressively through our short-term challenges. In transit, we have a record and growing backlog, with significant projects in all major markets around the world, and we are making meaningful progress in the Faiveley integration, with margins improving during the year. In freight, our backlog has now increased for three consecutive quarters, and demand appears to be stable in our key markets. Finally, we continue to invest in our balanced growth strategies, including new products and acquisitions, around the world.

Rail market conditions haven't improved as quickly as Wabtec expected this year. While there are some positive signs in the market, the industry as a whole remains cautious. That uncertainty was evident in rail car maker The Greenbrier Companies' (NYSE:GBX) recently reported fiscal third-quarter results. On the positive side, Greenbrier noted that it received 11,000 rail car orders during the quarter, which boosted its backlog to 31,000. However, CEO William Furman stated, "While we see emerging improvements in North American and European rail markets, we still expect a challenging commercial environment into calendar 2018."
Looking forward 
Given those challenges, as well as the revised timing of sales and projects already in the backlog, Wabtec is adjusting its full-year guidance. The company now anticipates that revenue will be about $3.85 billion and earnings will be $3.55 to $3.70 per share. That forecast is a bit lower than the one it provided last quarter, when it expected full-year revenue of around $4.1 billion and earnings between $3.95 and $4.15 per share.
