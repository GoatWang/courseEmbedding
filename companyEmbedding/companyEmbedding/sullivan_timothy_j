Timothy J. Sullivan has had a long history working with fragrances. Most
			    of his career in advertising centered on the development and
			    marketing of fragrances, cosmetics and related products; his
			    first “gig”,
			    fresh from the army, was at Avon Products in New York where he
			    was Assistant to the Director of Advertising. Chosen for Avon’s
			    in-house fragrance panels, his “nose” was considered “too
			    sophisticated” so
			    his opinions of a fragrances being tested usually meant those
			    selections would never reach the mass market. 

			    While at Della Femina, Travisano & Partners in NYC, Tim helped to
			    introduce Stick Ups, Carpet Fresh and other fragrance products for Airwick
			    Industries. He spent 14 years with the agency researching and developing
			    new fragrance products. Airwick taught Tim a very basic premise…the
			    fragrances we put in the atmosphere are completely different and shouldn’t
		    be confused with those we put on our skin.







Then, to Publicis Conseil in NYC working on Lancôme’s advertising
			    and new product introductions. He worked on national campaigns with Isabella
			    Rossellini and helped to introduce Cosmair skincare and fragrance products
			    to the US market. 
Now, Tim travels around the country and throughout Europe in search of
			    new fragrances and concepts. He maintains his contacts with the
			    major fragrance houses, so his nose is always up to date, if
			    occasionally a bit ahead of itself. “My clients don’t want
			    to wait for what’s next,” he says. “They want it now.
			    So I  create it for them.”

The Beverly Hills Hotel, Saks Fifth Avenue, Treillage NYC, The Monogram
						Shops and dozens more prestigious retailers all agree…our Private
						Label Program keeps their product line unique and distinct. Their customers
						keep coming back for more of their “signature” fragrances.
					Besides, the loyalty factor, the prestige value is enormous.
The same holds true for companies and corporations such as PARADIGM,
						DREAMWORKS, DANA BUCHMAN and HARRIS BEACH who use our products for promotion
						or as corporate gifts at Holiday time and all through the year.
There is something more than special about a package that’s personal
						and reflects the persona of the store or company. It adds the all-important,
						distinctive difference. And for companies, it’s a perfect way to
						promote products and services or to say “thank you”.
And there are so many choices we have to adapt your store or company
						to our products. Naturally, we do all the work…we’ll help
						you design your label, adapt the designs to fit the packaging, recommend
						and assist with your fragrances choices.
AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO ORDER THOUSANDS!
An initial order of 12 dozen will get your program rolling and you have
						our 27 fragrances to choose from. Just click on the Program FAQs icon to
