Why Cantab?Cantab employs a multi-strategy, multi-asset approach within the systematic space.  We aim to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns with low correlation to traditional investments in a technology driven environment.“Investors usually ask about the models Cantab employs... but the smarts, the core of what we do, is in the software”.Dr Tom HowatChief Technology Officer
	Risk-adjusted returns
To us, investment management equals risk management.  Cantab utilises sophisticated and robust proprietary risk management systems to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Multiple complementary and interlocking systems dynamically re-allocate risk across the entire portfolio.  We employ a rules-based investment approach which enables us to tailor risk on demand and build portfolios that target a constant level of volatility.

	Meaningful diversification
Cantab’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that combining uncorrelated sources of return produces superior results over time.  Unlike many systematic investment managers, who rely exclusively on trend-following strategies, our institutional-standard infrastructure has enabled us to build portfolios that adopt a multi-asset, multi-strategy approach.  We develop and implement investment and portfolio construction processes that aim to  deliver returns uncorrelated to long-only investments as well as to traditional hedge fund strategies.

Scientific rigour 
Science is the ethos that permeates the whole of Cantab.  It drives our culture.
Our scientists are at the heart of our business.  Based in Cambridge in the UK, close to the University and the city’s cluster of high-tech companies, our work resembles that of a scientific research organisation rather than a London City trading firm. 
Our discipline and flat structure provide a platform for our scientists to research, test and implement multiple systematic strategies.  It allows us to be creative while applying science to finance.  Our research is based on the scientific method and is hypothesis-driven rather than data-driven.
We have an iconoclastic view of the world and approach investing like few others.  We perform research and risk management as part of multiple teams across a non-hierarchical research environment that inspires scientists to work together across disciplines, rather than in silos.
With industrial strength, institutional-standard infrastructure, we believe we are a different type of manager and that our success rests on a collegial research environment, which in turn allows our team to produce work of the highest quality.

UK Stewardship Code - Cantab - Part of GAM Systematic




































 

Why Cantab?Why Systematic?Meet the Team About CantabWe thinkThe Investment ProgrammesJoin UsNews, Events and AwardsContactInvestor login 








UK Stewardship CodeCantab Capital Partners LLP UK Stewardship Code DisclosureUnder Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, Cantab Capital Partners LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers, as follows:

The seven principles of the Code are that institutional investors should:


		Publicly disclose their policy on how they will discharge their stewardship responsibilities;

		Have and publicly disclose a robust policy on managing conflicts of interest in relation to stewardship;

		Monitor their investee companies;

		Establish clear guidelines on when and how they will escalate their activities;

		Be willing to act collectively with other investors where appropriate;

		Have a clear policy on voting and disclosure of voting activity; and

		Report periodically on their stewardship and voting activities.

The Firm pursues a technical trading strategy and has developed in-house trading programmes that make all our investment trading decisions.  Investment holding periods are determined solely by the proprietary models, which do not consider corporate governance issues.

Therefore, the Firm pursues an investment strategy to which the aims of the Code are not relevant.

Consequently, while the Firm supports the general objectives that underlie the Code, the provisions of the Code are not relevant to the type of trading currently undertaken by the Firm.  If the Firm's investment strategy changes in such a manner that the provisions of the Code become relevant, the Firm will amend this disclosure accordingly.

Join UsYour FutureVacanciesOur Culture Beyond ScienceYour FutureCantab is investment science in action.  We apply our scientific backgrounds to developing statistical strategies and fully-automated execution systems, as well as optimising our Friday lunch order.
	The challenge
Cantab is a quantitative investment manager based in Cambridge, where computer strategies, rather than human traders, make the trading decisions. Developing strategies that aim to forecast some aspects of market behaviour is a highly intellectual exercise and requires fairly radical assumptions.  Much of our work involves taking ideas and results from academia and applying them to financial data.  It's an empirical science and the world's financial markets are, in some sense, our laboratory.

	Big & Small
Cantab is a small company in terms of people, but we have an impressive and highly sophisticated infrastructure behind us, which really is the best of both worlds.  Everyone is accessible and there is lots of communication and collaboration.  We have the data and tools to prototype and test ideas in a matter of minutes, and then - after rigorous discussions and reviews - to go live with new strategies.

	The success
Our technology and team have earned us a fantastic reputation, which means that we have been growing steadily since our launch in 2007 and are now a multibillion dollar investment manager with some of the most sophisticated and prestigious investors as clients.

	Getting involved
We have a very flat hierarchy, and have a weekly research meeting where we discuss ideas and hear what everyone has been working on.  Our collegial structure means that you can be involved across the board, if you want to.

	Your future
Our approach, and the way we think about things, means that we need people with strong statistical and programming skills.  We hire people from a range of scientific disciplines, and they don't need to have previous financial experience.
If you think you'd be a good fit, please have a look at our current vacancies. We look forward to hearing from you.

Pillar 3 Statement - Cantab - Part of GAM Systematic




































 

Why Cantab?Why Systematic?Meet the Team About CantabWe thinkThe Investment ProgrammesJoin UsNews, Events and AwardsContactInvestor login 








Pillar 3 StatementPillar 3 Disclosure and Policy for a Full Scope UK AIFM (Collective Portfolio Management Investment Firm)
	Introduction
	 

	Regulatory Context

The Pillar 3 disclosure of Cantab Capital Partners LLP (“the Firm”) is set out below as required by the FCA’s “Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and Investment Firms” (BIPRU) specifically BIPRU 11.3.3 R.  This is a requirement which stems from the UK’s CRDIII implementing Regulations which represented the European Union’s application of the Basel Capital Accord.  The Firm is no longer formally subject to CRD but remain subject to the UK’s implementation Regulations of CRD III.  The regulatory aim of the disclosures is to improve market discipline. 


	Frequency

The Firm will be making Pillar 3 disclosures at least annually.  The disclosures will be as at the Accounting Reference Date (“ARD”).


	Media and Location

The disclosure will be published on our website.


	Verification

The information contained in this document has not been audited by the Firm’s external auditors, as this is not a requirement, and does not constitute any form of financial statement and must not be relied upon in making any judgement on the Firm.


	Materiality

The Firm regards information as material in disclosures if its omission or misstatement could change or influence the assessment or decision of a user relying on that information for the purpose of making economic decisions.  If the Firm deems a certain disclosure to be immaterial, it may be omitted from this Statement.


	Confidentiality

The Firm regards information as proprietary if sharing that information with the public would undermine its competitive position.  Proprietary information may include information on products or systems which, if shared with competitors, would render the Firm’s investments therein less valuable.  Further, the Firm must regard information as confidential if there are obligations to customers or other counterparty relationships binding the Firm to confidentiality.  In the event that any such information is omitted, we shall disclose such and explain the grounds why it has not been disclosed.


	Summary

The CRD, to which the Firm remains subject as a consequence of the UK CRDIII implementing Regulations, have three pillars; Pillar 1 deals with minimum capital requirements; Pillar 2 deals with Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (“ICAAP”) undertaken by a firm and the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process through which the Firm and Regulator satisfy themselves on the adequacy of capital held by the Firm in relation to the risks it faces and; Pillar 3 which deals with public disclosure of risk management policies, capital resources and capital requirements. 

The Firm is a Full Scope UK AIFM of EEA/non-EEA AIFs and also undertakes additional activities which result in the Firm being a BIPRU firm.  It acts solely as agent, so the main protection to our customers is provided through client money and asset arrangements.  The Firm’s greatest risks have been identified as business and operational risk.  The Firm is required to disclose its risk management objectives and policies for each separate category of risk which include the strategies and processes to manage those risks; the structure and organisation of the relevant risk management function or other appropriate arrangement; the scope and nature of risk reporting and measurement systems; and the policies for hedging and mitigating risk, and the strategies and processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges and mitigants.

The Firm has assessed business and operational risks in its ICAAP and set out appropriate actions to manage them.

A number of key operations are outsourced by our clients, typically the AIFs to which we are an AIFM, to third party providers such as administrators reducing our exposure to operational risk.  The Firm has an operational risk framework (described below) in place to mitigate operational risk.  The Firm’s main exposure to credit risk is the risk that management and performance fees cannot be collected and, therefore, credit risk is considered low.  The Firm holds all cash and performance fee balances with banks assigned high credit ratings.

Market Risk exposure has been assessed by the Firm and is limited to the Firm’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and hence to any assets held on the Firm’s Balance Sheet denominated in a foreign currency. The Firm’s Reporting Currency is GBP and all foreign currency assets are converted into GBP where possible on a regular basis.


	Background to the Firm
	 

	Background

The Firm is incorporated in the UK and is authorised and regulated by the FCA as an AIFM of EEA/non-EEA AIFs.  In addition the Firm undertakes MiFID activities which give it the categorisation of a ‘BIPRU Firm’.

This Committee along with various groups (including but not limited to the legal and compliance group) at the Firm are responsible for ensuring adequate risk management in their respective areas of authority.

Regular Management Information is reviewed frequently by the Risk Committee detailing the risks to which the AIFs are exposed. In doing so, the Risk Committee is able to assess and analyse the risks to which the AIFs are exposed. Any significant findings of the Risk Committee are escalated to the Partnership.


	BIPRU 11.5.4
Disclosure: Compliance with BIPRU 3, BIPRU 4, BIPRU 7 and the Overall Pillar 2 Rule


	BIPRU 3 (Credit Risk)
For its Pillar 1 regulatory capital calculation of Credit Risk, under the credit risk capital component the Firm has adopted the Standardised approach (BIPRU 3.4) and the Simplified method of calculating risk weights (BIPRU 3.5).

Please note: As per GENPRU 2.1.46R, the Credit Risk Capital Requirement is only required to be calculated in respect of our designated investment business. This does not include our activities as an AIFM.

Disclosure: Credit Risk and Dilution Risk

The Firm is primarily exposed to Credit Risk from the risk of non-collection of management fees.  It holds all cash and performance fee balances with Banks assigned high credit ratings.  Consequently risk of past due or impaired exposures is minimal.  A financial asset is past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due. Impairment is defined as a reduction in the recoverable amount of a fixed asset or goodwill below its carrying amount.

Acquisition of Cantab completed, new quantitative strategies launching under GAM Systematic name













Press Release
4 October 2016

Acquisition of Cantab Capital Partners LLP (“Cantab”) closed on 3 October 2016 following regulatory approval
Cantab forms the cornerstone of newly created GAM Systematic platform
First product development milestone will be achieved with the launch of two new UCITS strategies under the GAM Systematic name

GAM has completed the acquisition of Cantab Capital Partners LLP (“Cantab”), which was first announced on 29 June 2016. Cantab, an industry-leading, multi-strategy systematic manager based in Cambridge, UK, manages USD 4.1 billion in assets for institutional clients worldwide (as at 1 October 2016).
The acquisition is expected to be accretive to GAM’s underlying earnings per share in the first full year of ownership. It will expand and diversify GAM’s active investment capabilities into systematic investing – a segment with growing investor demand, where returns show low correlation to traditional asset classes.
Systematic strategies use complex computer algorithms to make investment decisions and manage risk based on a wide range of information including technical and trading analytics, as well as fundamental and macroeconomic data.
Cantab, founded in 2006 by Dr Ewan Kirk, employs 55 people, all of whom will continue to work out of Cambridge post the transaction close. The firm’s investment philosophy and processes will remain intact and be driven by Cantab’s investment team. Cantab is renowned for its rigorous scientific research and multi-strategy approach to systematic investment. The firm’s state-of-the-art infrastructure and proprietary technology allow Cantab to run a suite of models across more than 150 macro markets and a universe of over 2,500 equities. The strength of the firm’s systems and data analytics is bolstered by best-of-breed trading and execution systems.
Successful development of two new GAM Systematic strategies
Cantab’s technology and its team of over 30 scientists, led by Dr Ewan Kirk, form the cornerstone of GAM Systematic. This new investment platform is co-headed by Adam Glinsman, CEO of Cantab, and Anthony Lawler, Head of Portfolio Management at GAM’s Alternative Investments Solutions (AIS) group.
GAM Systematic is dedicated to developing and running quantitative products and solutions across liquid alternatives and long-only strategies, in multiple asset classes from futures and forwards, to equities, debt and credit.
Two new UCITS funds are to be launched and will be based on Cantab’s proven methodology and tested investment strategies. Subject to regulatory approval, these new funds will offer daily liquidity and be available under the GAM Systematic name. Both funds will be designed to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns as well as offering diversification to equity and bond investments over the cycle. The new funds will also be structured to be cost-effective.
The systematic global equity market neutral strategy will contain Cantab’s established equity-focused models, which have delivered a successful return track record as part of Cantab’s flagship Quantitative Fund launched in 2007. It will invest in liquid equities globally using Cantab’s proprietary research and trading systems, without taking equity market beta. Over a three-year cycle, the strategy will aim to deliver attractive returns with annual volatility of 6-8%.
The systematic diversified macro strategy will be a multi-strategy, multi-asset product based on Cantab’s established Core Macro fund, which launched in 2013. It will seek to generate returns uncorrelated to traditional asset classes by identifying persistent and recurring sources of return across over 100 markets in currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities. Over the cycle, it is expected to deliver attractive returns with negligible correlation to traditional markets and annualised volatility of 10-12%.
In addition to the existing Cantab fund range, the GAM Systematic platform will also include GAM’s existing Alternative Risk Premia strategy, managed by Dr Lars Jaeger, one of the pioneers in the field of alternative beta.
GAM Systematic will serve as the Group’s innovation hub for the development of new technologies and approaches in systematic strategies. The GAM Systematic range will, over time, encompass products that apply systematic investing to alternative as well as long-only investment strategies.

Over a three-year cycle, the strategy will aim to deliver attractive returns with annual volatility of 6-8%.The systematic diversified macro strategy will be a multi-strategy, multi-asset product based on Cantab`s established Core Macro fund, which launched in 2013. It will seek to generate returns uncorrelated to traditional asset classes by identifying persistent and recurring sources of return across over 100 markets in currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities. Over the cycle, it is expected to deliver attractive returns with negligible correlation to traditional markets and annualised volatility of 10-12%.In addition to the existing Cantab fund range, the GAM Systematic platform will also include GAM`s existing Alternative Risk Premia strategy, managed by Dr Lars Jaeger, one of the pioneers in the field of alternative beta.GAM Systematic will serve as the Group`s innovation hub for the development of new technologies and approaches in systematic strategies. The GAM Systematic range will, over time, encompass products that apply systematic investing to alternative as well as long-only investment strategies.Further details on GAM Systematic can be found on: www.gam.com/en/systematicForthcoming events:   20 October 2016   Interim management statement Q3 2016     2 March 2017   Full-year results 2016     26 April 2017   Interim management statement Q1 2017     27 April 2017   Annual General Meeting    For more information, please contact:Read MoreGAM Media Relations: London: +44 (0) 207 393 86 99Zurich:  +41 (0) 58 426 62 65GAM Investor Relations:Zurich: +41 (0) 58 426 31 36Cantab Media Relations:Andrew Honnor, Georgiana Brunner or Rob WhiteGreenbrook Communications +44 (0)20 7952 2000 Visit us at: www.gam.com Follow us on: Twitter, LinkedIn and XINGAbout GAM GAM is one of the world`s leading independent, pure-play asset managers.

Cantab Capital Partners is a hedge fund based in Cambridge, England, co-founded by Dr. Ewan Kirk and Erich Schlaikjer. Cantab operates quantitative funds using computer models to drive investment decisions.[1] As of Feb 2015 Cantab had $4.5 billion in assets under management, after launching with $30 million in 2006.[2] The firm takes its name from Cantabrigia, the medieval Latin name for Cambridge.[3] It is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority. Cantab Capital Partners was acquired by GAM in 2016 and is since part of GAM Systematic.[4]

Funds[edit]
Cantab's stated investment philosophy is that algorithmic trading can help to overcome cognitive biases inherent in human-based trading decisions, by exploiting persistent statistical relationships between markets. Taking a multi-asset, multi-model approach, the majority of Cantab's traded instruments are liquid futures and forwards, across currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities.
Cantab manages two investment funds: the CCP Quantitative Programme (launched 2007, with $30m) and the CCP Core Macro Programme (launched 2013). Both are computer-based algorithmic trading systems, also known as automated trading, black-box trading, algo trading or systematic trading.
In January 2013, Goldman Sachs became a minor investor in Cantab. Kirk is a former Goldman partner; Schlaikjer is a former Managing Director and European Chief Technology Officer of Goldman's Quantitative Strategies Group. Cantab is reported to have been granted access to Goldman's technology infrastructure.[5][6]
Performance[edit]
At the end of December 2014 Cantab's leading fund, the CCP Quantitative Fund, had gained 39.3% over the previous 12 months. The fund gained 13 percent over January 2015 alone. These gains brought the fund to an annualized return of 11.38 percent since inception in March 2007; the Quantitative fund now has $3.5bn in assets under management. [7]
The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantab's 2014 results took place in the context of renewed investor interest in computer-traded funds and commodities-based funds.[8][9]
Fee structure[edit]
Cantab’s Core Macro Programme is notable for its fee structure, charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 10 per cent of profits. Industry-standard fees among hedge funds are often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits. Although algorithm-based hedge funds tend to offer lower fees, made possible by their technological infrastructure, The New York Times reported that Cantab had "...lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do.[6] Some industry experts, such as Robert Leonard of Credit Suisse, believe that such commission levels are unsustainable.[10]
Employees[edit]
Cantab is largely staffed by mathematicians and scientists, many of whom have ties to nearby University of Cambridge.[6] In a 2013 interview with the Financial Times, Kirk said “We have made a commitment to investors that we have no plans to be bigger than 80 professionals."[11]
Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information[edit]
In 2015 Cantab donated £5 million to launch the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information at Cambridge University. The research institute will use mathematical science techniques to analyse data for application in fields such as medicine, meteorology, urban planning and financial risk analysis. The Institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph.D. students.[12]
The Institute was set-up in order to address the lack of philanthropic funding for data research, and to stimulate cutting-edge research in the area. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Kirk said "...it is much easier to get funding for medical science or computer science [than for] more theoretical subjects like mathematics”. Kirk also characterised the donation as "philanthropic” and that the firm plans to keep its research in-house, while maintaining a "rewarding dialogue" with the Institute.

Recent market volatility caught many investors flat-footed. Among the few winners were traders who let a computer be their guide. Hedge-fund managers who employ complicated, automatic-trading strategies made millions off the wild swings in currency and commodity markets in recent weeks, investors said. Many of these so-called quants...performed well because they positioned themselves ahead of market moves that befuddled traditional investors. In many cases, they ramped up bets on the momentum against the euro and reaped a huge win when the Swiss National Bank removed its currency peg

Why Cantab?Cantab employs a multi-strategy, multi-asset approach within the systematic space.  We aim to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns with low correlation to traditional investments in a technology driven environment.“Investors usually ask about the models Cantab employs... but the smarts, the core of what we do, is in the software”.Dr Tom HowatChief Technology Officer
	Risk-adjusted returns
To us, investment management equals risk management.  Cantab utilises sophisticated and robust proprietary risk management systems to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Multiple complementary and interlocking systems dynamically re-allocate risk across the entire portfolio.  We employ a rules-based investment approach which enables us to tailor risk on demand and build portfolios that target a constant level of volatility.

	Meaningful diversification
Cantab’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that combining uncorrelated sources of return produces superior results over time.  Unlike many systematic investment managers, who rely exclusively on trend-following strategies, our institutional-standard infrastructure has enabled us to build portfolios that adopt a multi-asset, multi-strategy approach.  We develop and implement investment and portfolio construction processes that aim to  deliver returns uncorrelated to long-only investments as well as to traditional hedge fund strategies.

Scientific rigour 
Science is the ethos that permeates the whole of Cantab.  It drives our culture.
Our scientists are at the heart of our business.  Based in Cambridge in the UK, close to the University and the city’s cluster of high-tech companies, our work resembles that of a scientific research organisation rather than a London City trading firm. 
Our discipline and flat structure provide a platform for our scientists to research, test and implement multiple systematic strategies.  It allows us to be creative while applying science to finance.  Our research is based on the scientific method and is hypothesis-driven rather than data-driven.
We have an iconoclastic view of the world and approach investing like few others.  We perform research and risk management as part of multiple teams across a non-hierarchical research environment that inspires scientists to work together across disciplines, rather than in silos.
With industrial strength, institutional-standard infrastructure, we believe we are a different type of manager and that our success rests on a collegial research environment, which in turn allows our team to produce work of the highest quality.

Cantab Capital Partners is a hedge fund based in Cambridge, England, co-founded by Dr. Ewan Kirk and Erich Schlaikjer. Cantab operates quantitative funds using computer models to drive investment decisions.[1] As of Feb 2015 Cantab had $4.5 billion in assets under management, after launching with $30 million in 2006.[2] The firm takes its name from Cantabrigia, the medieval Latin name for Cambridge.[3] It is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority. Cantab Capital Partners was acquired by GAM in 2016 and is since part of GAM Systematic.[4]

Funds[edit]
Cantab's stated investment philosophy is that algorithmic trading can help to overcome cognitive biases inherent in human-based trading decisions, by exploiting persistent statistical relationships between markets. Taking a multi-asset, multi-model approach, the majority of Cantab's traded instruments are liquid futures and forwards, across currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities.
Cantab manages two investment funds: the CCP Quantitative Programme (launched 2007, with $30m) and the CCP Core Macro Programme (launched 2013). Both are computer-based algorithmic trading systems, also known as automated trading, black-box trading, algo trading or systematic trading.
In January 2013, Goldman Sachs became a minor investor in Cantab. Kirk is a former Goldman partner; Schlaikjer is a former Managing Director and European Chief Technology Officer of Goldman's Quantitative Strategies Group. Cantab is reported to have been granted access to Goldman's technology infrastructure.[5][6]
Performance[edit]
At the end of December 2014 Cantab's leading fund, the CCP Quantitative Fund, had gained 39.3% over the previous 12 months. The fund gained 13 percent over January 2015 alone. These gains brought the fund to an annualized return of 11.38 percent since inception in March 2007; the Quantitative fund now has $3.5bn in assets under management. [7]
The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantab's 2014 results took place in the context of renewed investor interest in computer-traded funds and commodities-based funds.[8][9]
Fee structure[edit]
Cantab’s Core Macro Programme is notable for its fee structure, charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 10 per cent of profits. Industry-standard fees among hedge funds are often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits. Although algorithm-based hedge funds tend to offer lower fees, made possible by their technological infrastructure, The New York Times reported that Cantab had "...lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do.[6] Some industry experts, such as Robert Leonard of Credit Suisse, believe that such commission levels are unsustainable.[10]
Employees[edit]
Cantab is largely staffed by mathematicians and scientists, many of whom have ties to nearby University of Cambridge.[6] In a 2013 interview with the Financial Times, Kirk said “We have made a commitment to investors that we have no plans to be bigger than 80 professionals."[11]
Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information[edit]
In 2015 Cantab donated £5 million to launch the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information at Cambridge University. The research institute will use mathematical science techniques to analyse data for application in fields such as medicine, meteorology, urban planning and financial risk analysis. The Institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph.D. students.[12]
The Institute was set-up in order to address the lack of philanthropic funding for data research, and to stimulate cutting-edge research in the area. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Kirk said "...it is much easier to get funding for medical science or computer science [than for] more theoretical subjects like mathematics”. Kirk also characterised the donation as "philanthropic” and that the firm plans to keep its research in-house, while maintaining a "rewarding dialogue" with the Institute.
