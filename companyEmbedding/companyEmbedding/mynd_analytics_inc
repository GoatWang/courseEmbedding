MYnd Analytics's Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry, or PEER Online®, is a cloud-based platform which allows physicians to exchange outcome data referenced to their patients' neurophysiology.

Finding the right medication for an individual patient suffering from mental health issues is one of the biggest challenges facing medical professionals. Most mental health medications are currently prescribed through trial and error, a process that can be detrimental to patients and their families. Medications affect everyone differently, and with over 130 psychotropic medications to choose from, it is difficult for physicians to know which regimen is best. 

PEER Online is a service that allows physicians to compare and learn which medication treatments have been effective, and which have not been effective for their peers treating patients with similar brain patterns. It builds on the company's original physician-developed database, Referenced-EEG® (rEEG®​).

It's based on a transformative idea used to help treat pediatric cancer.  In the 1970's, oncologists treating pediatric cancer developed a registry that helped them network and compare treatment regimens and patient outcomes, in order to advance knowledge of pediatric cancer. The system, which is still in place, enables physicians to learn what works and what does not for treating pediatric cancer, and has significantly improved children's cancer survival and recovery rates. 

As a cloud-based outcome registry, PEER Online provides the same kind of vital exchange of information between medical professionals treating patients with mental health issues.

Research Summary  





From a rapidly growing research base, 100 peer-reviewed studies of Quantitative EEG (QEEG) neurometrics (n = 6,025) have demonstrated the utility of these markers, including:12 randomized controlled trials of QEEG neurometricsfor predicting medication response (n = 2,087)88 observational cohort studies  (n = 3,938)More information on these studies can be found below.
 






 










​PEER Product Description
PEER Online® is a clinical decision support database that uses a combination of software, analytics, and clinical outcomes to provide objective, adjunctive medication response information to physicians treating patients with non-psychotic behavioral disorders.  PEER Reports™ represent the output of the Psychiatric Electroencephalography Evaluation Registry (PEER), an outcome registry developed by physicians in order to build better evidence for prescribing in brain disorders.PEER Online uses a statistical analysis of EEG outputs and other patient information to generate a report that indicates the statistical likelihood of the patient’s responsiveness to classes of central nervous system (CNS) medications (i.e. antidepressants), groups (i.e. SSRI) and individual agents (i.e. fluoxetine). A discriminant analysis compares neurophysiologic abnormalities of the patient to patterns of abnormalities of known responders to CNS drugs in the company’s outcomes database of symptomatic patients. This provides a probability estimate of the similarity of the patient’s profile with the profile of groups of individuals constituting the normative and clinical (symptomatic) database, which provides the treating physician guidance to which treatments the patient will most likely respond to, and those treatments to which the patient is least likely to respond. This is adjunctive information, to be interpreted only within the context of the overall clinical assessment of the patient by the attending physician.
​PEER Outcomes Database
PEER Online is based upon a database of patient outcomes that has been collected by physicians for over 20 years, and physicians have been using this ‘practice based evidence’ data to help provide adjunctive information to guide the treatment of their patients. The practice of utilizing practice based evidence (PBE) to guide treatment has been well documented (Horn, et al., 2007) and utilized by multiple medical disciplines where solid evidence based guidelines were unavailable or inadequate, i.e. pediatric oncology. It is not surprising that physicians have taken the initiative to develop PBE databases to support the treatment of their patients.The database initially developed by Suffin and Emory now contains data on over 9,900 patients with over 37,000 clinical endpoints, representing known patient responses to over 30 commonly used psychotropic medications. The database continues to grow as PEER physicians add patient outcomes to treatment medications that are correlated to a patient’s QEEG.  As more medication outcomes are added to the database by practicing physicians, PEER Online will be able to provide even more predictive information to assist physicians in treating their patients with non-psychotic behavioral disorders.
PEER Process
Procedurally, PEER Online utilizes standard 21-lead digital electroencephalographic equipment measuring the patient in a resting (but awake) state. The recording generally takes 30-60 minutes. Patients are classified based upon the 1,142 variables calculated in the recording (FDA-approved neurometric system) and categorized based on the outcome history in treating patients with similar neurophysiologic outputs. From these outputs and the correlation to the outcome database, reports may indicate single or multiple medications based on the nature of the physiologic abnormality discovered. The entire procedure is rapid, non-invasive, devoid of radiation or high strength magnetic fields, and results in a report, the PEER Outcome Report that is easily used by clinicians given its similarity in format to antibiotic sensitivity testing.
The Body of Evidence for PEER 
Medication Response Research Using Quantitative EEG Since the 1970’s EEG recordings have been digitized and subjected to quantitative analysis (QEEG), which yields more information than can be appreciated by simple visual inspection. QEEG extends EEG technology beyond qualitative identification of abnormality and allows for comparison of an individual patient's EEG pattern with large public databases of age matched, asymptomatic (control) group EEG values (Duffy et al. 1979; John et al., 1977).  Medication-induced changes in EEG and QEEG data have been reported for a broad range of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, stimulants, antipsychotics, lithium salts, and anticonvulsants (Herrmann et al., 1979, Itil et al., 1973, 1979; Saletu et al., 1987; Small et al., 1989; Struve, 1987). These drug changes are specific in regard to effects on distinct components of the EEG pattern and are dose-dependent, reversible upon medication withdrawal, and measurable across psychiatric syndromes and in asymptomatic volunteers.In those studies obtaining baseline, medication-free EEGs, investigators demonstrated unique QEEG features that could be used to aid in treatment guidance. For example, patients with major depressive illness with excess alpha wave magnitudes were retrospectively reported responsive to antidepressants that reduce alpha magnitude (Ohashi, 1994). Similarly, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with excess alpha wave activity responded best to antidepressants (Prichep et al., 1993). In contrast, a subgroup of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with elevated theta wave activity did not respond favorably to antidepressants that are known to increase theta wave magnitudes and would therefore be predicted to exacerbate the symptoms of these patients (Prichep et al., 1993). Finally, patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed a general decrease in EEG patterns and were predicted to respond favorably to methylphenidate, an agent that accelerates EEG frequencies (Satterfield et al., 1973).Subsequent work in depression led to a large multicenter trial (n = 375) (Leuchter et al., 2009) that examined “cordance” - a frontal QEEG index’s ability to predict response to the SSRI, escitalopram, after one week of treatment. Subjects were subsequently randomized to remain on treatment or crossed over to alternative treatment. Seventy-five (75) subjects remained on escitalopram and 52% responded to therapy after 49 days. In these subjects, the QEEG pattern indicated response with a 74% accuracy, demonstrating that changes in asymmetry composite EEG index one week into pharmacological treatment can be predictive of positive response to escitalopram at the end of treatment.These studies found that there were significant EEG heterogeneities within neuropsychiatric disorders. The existence of these subgroups suggests that different patients within the same neuropsychiatric disorder would differentially respond to medications and indicates that EEG patterns could predict the most effective pharmacotherapy for a specific patient.






PEER EvidencePEER Online, the successor to ‘referenced EEG’ (or ‘rEEG’), has been studied for over 20 years and the evidence supporting the effectiveness of using a physician based outcomes database to guide treatment is significant (see ‘Evidence Table for PEER Online’). PEER Online is similar to a standard QEEG in that it uses QEEG output variables, but differs from a standard QEEG in that it references the QEEG to a normative and then symptomatic database. By comparing a given patient’s QEEG to a database of QEEGs of subjects who have tried and responded to a specific medication, PEER Online can provide useful information regarding the response of neurophysiologically similar patients to a wide number of medications. PEER Online may thus have the advantage of providing physicians with useful information as to medication outcomes before a medication regime is started. As important as the positive findings (e.g. Sensitive finding) from PEER Online may be, physician users have also reported that negative findings (in which neurophysiologically similar patients reported resistant outcomes for certain medications) can be extremely useful in reducing trial and error pharmacotherapy. It has also been used to help select the medication that best matches the QEEG brainwave pattern, regardless of “symptom clusters,” currently used for diagnostic nomenclature.The initial publication of results using the information from an EEG-based database to guide treatment was the Suffin and Emory article in which they examined attentional and affective disorders and their association with pharmacotherapeutic outcomes (Suffin and Emory, 1995). This was a retrospective analysis of treatment outcomes in sequential patients with Attention Deficit Disorder and Affective Disorders. One hundred medication-free patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for attentional and affective disorders underwent pretreatment QEEG, where the data was submitted to a normative database. Following the EEG, attention-disordered patients were first treated with a stimulant, secondarily with an antidepressant, and tertiarily with an anticonvulsant. Affectively disordered patients were treated initially with antidepressant, and secondarily augmented with anticonvulsant or lithium. Tertiary treatment was a stimulant. Patients were assessed up to 6 months. A Clinical Global Improvement score was assigned. Similar Neurometric subgroups were identified within both the attentional and the affectively disordered patients. Without regard to DSM-III-R diagnosis, there were robust correlations between Neurometric subgroup membership, responsivity to selected pharmacologic agent class(es), and clinical outcome resulting in an 87% response to antidepressants. Another subgroup was 100% responsive to stimulants and a third was 85% responsive to anticonvulsants/lithium. A fourth subgroup was 80% responsive to anticonvulsants. Patients with similar Neurometric features responded to the same class(es) of psychopharmacologic agent(s) despite their DSM-III-R classification.Other smaller, preliminary studies have suggested a potential role in using this information for medication selection for depression, to name just one psychiatric disorder. A prospective, randomized, controlled 25-week study at a Veterans Affairs hospital consisted of two groups of treatment-resistant depressed patients (n=6 control, n=7 experimental) (Suffin, et al. 2007). The trial used these quantitative EEG features to guide prescribing of psychotropic medications, while the control group received treatment as usual. The results indicated that six of seven subjects augmented with QEEG data received ratings of moderate to marked improvement on both the Ham-D and Beck’s Depression Inventory. Only a single subject in the control group did this well. When unblinded, that same subject had been treated successfully with the medication that was consistent with the EEG patterns in the report. Pilot studies using these QEEG variables in eating disorders (Greenblatt, et al. 2011) and substance abuse (Schiller, 2008;Shaffer, et.al. 2005,) demonstrated similar promising results.Another pilot study (DeBattista, et al. 2008) was conducted to compare this same methodology with the Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) algorithm for patients with treatment-resistant depression. This 10-week study (n=18) found the data derived from the QEEG variables resulted in statistically greater change from baseline scores for the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR16) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) than TMAP-guided therapy. It also found that five subjects in the TMAP group received a successful TMAP therapy that was identical to what would have been prescribed with the information obtained for the variables from the referenced-EEG database (DeBattista, et al. 2008).Based on these earlier studies which suggested that using the information from shared outcomes based on QEEG patterns could assist clinicians in being cautious yet efficacious in their choice of medications, especially for treatment-refractory patients, a larger trial was run. In a multicenter, randomized trial, DeBattista found the referenced-EEG database treatment group (experimental) was compared with an optimized treatment based on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study guidelines (control) initially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in patients with treatment-refractory major depressive disorder (DeBattista, et al. 2011). The experimental group’s selection led to statistically better outcomes compared with the control group. The improvement in the group guided by the QEEG data over the control group was significant as early as two weeks and the improvement continued throughout the 12-week study and demonstrated significantly greater improvement on both primary endpoints (QIDS-SR16 and Q-LES-Q-SF, i.e. the same as in the STAR*D study) of P <0.0002 compared with control, as well as statistical superiority in nine of 12 secondary endpoints. Because there are innumerable combinations of therapies available from the databases’ report, the DeBattista study was not intended to evaluate any one medication against another, but to examine it as a tool to improve outcomes in this difficult population.In a recent retrospective chart review in the treatment of depression in Eating Disorders, Greenblatt reported on 22 patients with a 2-year previous history to using the referenced-EEG database to guide treatment and followed them for 2-5 years. Patients demonstrated significant decrease in depressive symptoms (Ham-D), severity of illness (CGI-S), and overall clinical global improvement (CGI-I). The group also had substantially fewer inpatients, residential and partial hospitalization days within the 2-year follow up period compared to the two years prior to the use of the report. (Greenblatt, et al. 2011)
﻿Evidence for Current Treatment
Psychiatry is plagued by the lack of a clinically useful biomarker assessment system to guide treatment. Instead, pharmacotherapy is typified by an inductive trial and error process resulting in significant additional morbidity, mortality, and costs due to failed medication trials. Despite extensive research resulting in more than 130 FDA-approved medications used in treating psychiatric disorders, evidence-based guidance is largely lacking for selecting amongst these options to treat refractory patients.Lack of EffectivenessIn 2007, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), released a report on a systematic review they conducted on “Comparative Effectiveness of Second-Generation Antidepressants in the Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Depression”. In this extensive review of 293 published articles, AHRQ noted almost 40% of patients did not respond to these treatment medications and that over 50% of the patients failed to achieve remission (AHRQ; Effective Health Care #7, Executive Summary, 2007). Although not an impressive response rate, the authors were encouraged by a new study that that was not included in their review due to its late publication; the STAR*D study.STAR*D (Rush, 2006) is the largest study to date evaluating pharmacotherapy for depression and was designed to provide guidance in selecting the best ‘next-step’ treatment for the many patients who failed o get adequate relief from their initial SSRI treatment. By enrolling over 4,000 patients first treated with escitalopram, STAR*D ensured a sufficient number of treatment failures for its step 2, 3, and 4 comparisons. Discouragingly, there were no significant differences found in the five next-step comparisons of eleven pharmacologically distinct treatments even though the N per each specific treatment ranged from 51 to 286 patients and was therefore more than sufficient to identify differences if any existed. STAR*D does document some of the negative consequences from failed medication trials (see table below). These include progressive step-by-step:Decreasing remission and response ratesIncreasing relapse rates; andIncreasing dropout rates despite STAR*D’s exemplary free, acute and continuing careIn recent re-analyses of the STAR*D data, several studies have question the effectiveness of the treatments (Pigott et al., 2010; Pigott, 2011) and certainly has brought into question the tolerability of the treatments given the relapse and dropout rates noted in the table above. Pigott notes that ‘In stark contrast to STAR*D’s report of positive findings supporting antidepressants’ effectiveness, only 108 of its 4,041 patients (2.7%) had an acute-care remission, and during the 12 months of continuing care, these patients neither relapsed nor dropped out.’In response to the STAR*D reports showing limited efficacy for a variety of antidepressant strategies, the NIMH funded the recently published CO-MED study (Rush et al., 2011) testing whether starting patients with several antidepressants at the same time would be associated with increased efficacy. Six hundred and sixty-five (665) patients with MDD were randomized to a 12-week acute treatment and participants who experienced substantial benefit in the acute phase were enrolled in an additional 16-week continuation treatment. There was no significant difference between the response or remission rates observed in the three arms in either the acute phase or the continuation phase (12-28 weeks).Clearly, even in the most optimistic evaluation of available treatments for patients with any treatment resistant disorder, an effective rate of 40% indicates that most medications are simply not sufficiently effective to alleviate the patient’s symptoms and most certainly are not providing a remission of disease. This is particularly clear when it is reported that in antidepressant trials there is a placebo response rate of between 35% - 45% (Fava, et al., 2003). Therefore, it can be convincingly argued that these treatments for antidepressants are no more effective than no medication at all.Recent research raises doubts about the degree to which psychopharmacological treatment has kept pace with our advances in understanding the brain and psychiatric disorders. There is a plethora of new psychiatric medications, but there is growing recognition that these new generation medications may not hold significant advantages over older medications despite their higher costs. It has been observed (DePaulo, 2006) that, when viewed together, the three major studies (STAR*D, CATIE (Stroup, 2003), and STEP-BD (Goldberg, 2009)) question whether or not modern pharmacological provide increased benefits for the additional costs. While none of these studies (STAR*D, CATIE, and STEP-BD) have focused primarily on comparing older and newer treatments, such contrasts do not suggest any dramatic advantages for the newer medications.Low tolerabilityIt is common in treating patients with mental disorders, particularly patients who are treatment resistant, they patients stop taking their medications for various reasons, whether it is a lack of effectiveness or side effects of the medication. This lack of adherence to the treatment can collectively be considered tolerability to the treatment, and the evidence for low tolerability of these treatment medications is significant.With the STAR*D study, over 60% of the patients dropped out of the study prematurely, even though they were provided the free care throughout the study, and were managed at a level far higher than could be expected in the standard care of private practice. Whereas it is difficult to know if they dropped from the study due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment or due to side effects of the medication, there is clear evidence that the side effect profile of these treatments is significant. In the AHRQ systematic review, it was noted that 61% of the patients in the efficacy trials they reviewed had at least 1 adverse event. Further, the same report notes that between 16% and 6% of severe adverse events was reported for the second-generation antidepressants.In the CO-MED study, although there were no significant differences in efficacy, there was a significant difference in the side effect burden for the patients. In the two polypharmacy arms the maximum side effect burden was between 10% and 15% in both the acute and continuation phases, however in the single treatment arm the side effect burden was only 4% in the acute phase and 5% in the continuation phase. This large, well designed, adequately powered study suggests that for a significant number of patients with MDD, adding medication only adds to their side effects without an increase in efficacy, thus increasing to the low rate of tolerability.SummaryIn 2009, Dr. Thomas Insel made similar observations to those of DePaulo, noting that second-generation medications have consistently demonstrated no significant advantage compared with first-generation medication in multiple comparative effectiveness studies funded by the NIMH (Insel, 2009). He also felt that current medication regimes help too few people improve from the perspective of side effects, and a recent prospective study has now even called into question the widely held belief that second-generation antipsychotics produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia (Woods, 2010).It is increasingly clear that the reason there are so many treatment resistant patients (patients who have failed on two or more medication trials) is due to the lack of effectiveness of the medications and/or the high side effect burden of the treatments. The evidence points to a poor understanding of the underlying physiological causes of the symptoms of these disorders and therefore the ineffective diagnosis as the root cause of the ineffectiveness of the current medication treatments. Without objective physiologically based clinical evidence to support clinical decisions, treating physicians can only respond to their patients in the best way possible, trial and error of approved and un-approved treatments.
The case for neurometrics
Mental illness is a profound burden on the world’s health and productivity. In fact, it ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in established market economies (Murray & Lopez, 1996).  Despite the magnitude of the problem, the treatment of mental illness, and more specifically the most prevalent behavioral disorders of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and AD/HD, has been problematic. The reasons are multifaceted; first, there are no objective decision support tools to support treatment. Unlike other areas of medicine, psychiatry has lacked biomarkers that can help guide pharmacotherapy with similar reliability as bacterial assays that guide antibiotic treatment. Second, the treatment guidelines most widely used for behavioral disorders like depression are based upon little or no clinical evidence. (Insel, 2013).  And finally, diagnoses for behavioral disorders are based upon symptoms and not the underlying physiological etiology. Psychopharmacotherapy is inductive and assumes that certain behavioral symptoms respond to a specific medication class. This selection process is highly subjective.Without the objective physiologically tests available to other medical specialties or clinical decision support tools such as evidence based treatment guidelines to follow, treating physicians can only rely upon personal experience or antidotal information. In essence, physicians must resort to a trial and error process where they try a treatment and wait and see if it is effective. As noted by Thomas Insel, MD, Director, National Institute of Mental Health in the NIMH Director’s Blog of August 30, 2010, “Clinicians must often resort to trial and error before finding a treatment regimen that works, often subjecting patients to weeks of ineffective treatments or adverse side effects in the process.”As the term implies, with trial and error it is not uncommon for the first, second, or even third treatment medication to not be sufficiently effective to provide significant improvement. Even with multiple medications administered sequentially, many do not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy (Warden et al., 2007).  The STAR*D study (Rush et al., 2006), which included more than 4,000 subjects with depression, observed a only a 50% response to the primary medication, and for those patients who failed the primary treatment medication, only an additional response of around 25% was observed when switched either to two other classes of antidepressants or cognitive behavior therapy.Therefore a significant percentage of patients with non-psychotic behavioral disorders are considered ‘Treatment Resistant’ (TR). Treatment resistant are those patients that fail to achieve a significant improvement on the initial and/or subsequent treatment regimens. The prevalence of TR patients varies within the different disorders, but published data suggests that for patients with depression up to 50% did not respond to initial treatment. For patients with Bipolar Disorders, 42% of patients failed to achieve recovery (NIHM-funded STEP-BD Best Practice Treatment Pathway (Perlis, 2006)), 10-40% of Anxiety patients do not respond to treatment and many more have residual symptoms (Bystritsky et al., 2006), and for patients with AD/HD, between 30-40% of patients do not respond to repeated trails of medications (Doyle, 2006).Since the current standard of care for psychiatric patients is trial and error, and because of this process many patients do not find significant improvement to their mental disorders, treating physicians must resort to other methods to find relieve for their patients suffering. More and more, physicians are using multiple medications simultaneously, a practice known as ‘Polypharmacy’. In a study undertaken between 1996 and 2005, psychiatrists significantly increased their use of polypharmacy such that outpatient visits resulting in two or more prescribed psychotropic drugs increased from 42.6% in 1996 to 59.8% in 2005 and psychiatric visits resulting in three or more such drugs being prescribed doubled, increasing from 16.9% to 33.2% (Mojtabai et al., 2010).Additionally, physicians are frequently using off label medications to treat treatment resistant patients. Off-label prescribing of psychopharmacology is common and perhaps necessary. Off label uses of psychotropic medications can be part of a good psychopharmacology practice. This is not an unusual practice but he standard of care for psychiatry because of the evidence compared to the unmet needs of patients. The difficulty is that there is little evidence supporting many of the treatments for particular disorders and these medications are powerful psychotropic medications that have a significant side effect profile.As a result of the trial and error treatment process, patients are prescribed different medications for weeks at a time. The problem, aside from the patient not receiving relief from their disease while trying to find the ‘right’ treatment, is that the medications being prescribed, both on and off label medications, are powerful drugs that have significant side effect profiles, including the potential increase of suicidality. The side effect burden of these medications can be significant, both medically and economically.Without objective clinical decision support tools that are based upon evidence, trial and error will continue to be the standard of care for psychiatric medicine. As Thomas Insel, MD, PhD noted in his keynote address to the American Psychiatric Association at their annual meeting in 2005, “We need to develop biomarkers, including brain imaging, to develop the validity of these disorders. We need to develop treatments that go after the core pathology, understood by imaging”.
Treatment Guidelines
The current medical model for treating patients is based upon symptom-based medical practice and pathophysiologic measurement. Psychiatry is unfortunately unique among medical specialties in its lack of such measurements. This has hindered both the advancement of psychiatry in general and clinical practice in particular. Thus, in the current therapeutic model for psychiatry, and in particular of any treatment resistant disorder, psychiatrists much choose treatment medications based upon patient symptoms, response to previous treatment, and behaviors. Significant limitations result because these illness features do not have a simple relationship with medication response. Without a defined pathologic abnormality to treat, or a physiologic marker to guide treatment, psychiatrists have been forced into the position of choosing between large numbers of psychotropic medications without ample evidence to support their choices.This is particularly true for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and specifically for Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Whereas the same holds true for bipolar disorders and other psychotic disorders, MDD is very representative of the issues.Reimbursement and quality control for the treatment of depression by many payers in the US is guided by:The American Psychiatric Association (APA) treatment guidelines (APA, 2008)The Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) treatment algorithm (Crismon, 1999)Results from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study (Rush, 2006)These guidelines and reports attempt to provide insight regarding the treatment of depression from the first line therapy through more complex scenarios involving TRD.The APA guidelines document is a practical guide to the management of major depressive disorder for adults over the age of 18 and represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and rational clinical practice. This guideline strives to be as free as possible of bias toward a theoretical posture, and it aims to represent a practical approach to treatment.The TMAP is a treatment algorithm that constitutes the most extensive and comprehensive development and implementation to date of medication algorithms for persons with serious mental illness. An algorithm is a rule or set of rules that is applied to solving a problem. Medication algorithms are a subset of practice guidelines. They are distinguished by an exclusive focus on medications and by a more step-by-step approach to clinical decisions. Current projects address the treatment of Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. TMAP was initiated by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation in collaboration with a consortium of Texas academic medical centers. The development of the TMAP algorithms incorporated expert panels, literature review, and consensus conferences. The Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithms (TIMA) is the practical, clinician-targeted implementation of TMAP.STAR*D was set up to evaluate clinical strategies to improve outcomes for patients with TRD, determine the best next-step treatments for depressed patients who do not respond satisfactorily to earlier treatment attempts, and compare relative efficacy and patients’ acceptance of different treatment strategies to relieve depression. Focusing on the common clinical question of what to do next when patients fail to respond to a standard trial of treatment with antidepressant medication, STAR*D aimed a defining which subsequent treatment strategies, in what order or sequence, and in what combination(s) are both acceptable to patients and provide the best clinical results with the least side effects.Operationally, those who did not respond to a line of treatment were then assigned to either a) augmenting the first antidepressant with other medications or psychotherapy, b) changing to a different antidepressant or psychotherapy, c) adding psychotherapy or discontinuing the first antidepressant medication while switching to psychotherapy, d) switching to another antidepressant, e) augmenting the first antidepressant with other medications, or f) augmenting first antidepressant with other medications or switchingto another antidepressant. So after failing the first line of therapy, patients were randomized to the next-step (Level 2) treatment strategies based upon the above options. After indicating which options are or are not acceptable to them, patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment option within those strategies that are deemed acceptable to and medically safe for them. Patients who did not have a satisfactory therapeutic response to their Level 2 treatment were presented with additional treatment options as a third step (Level 3). Again, they were assigned randomly to one option, which included medication switching and medication augmentation, at Level 3 of the treatment protocol. Similarly, Level 4 treatment options were provided for patients who did not respond satisfactorily to the Level 3 of the treatment protocol. STAR*D reported Level 3 and Level 4 results in three trials; two trials for Level 3 and one trial for Level 4(Fava, 2006; McGrath, 2006; Nierenberg, 2006; Rush 2006). Level 3 and Level 4 randomized controlled trials in STAR*D referred to trials in patients who had previously failed two and three antidepressant medication trials, respectively.Whereas all of these guidelines are valuable, all are problematic. While the APA guidelines provide evidence support for their first line treatment recommendations, no evidence is provided for the TRD treatment recommendations and did not reference any studies specifically evaluating TRD. TMAP was primarily designed using expert panel consensus, which is considered a lower level of evidence (Level 4) on the scale of evidence used by the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM). The remission rates in STAR*D using Hamilton-D scores in all treatment arms in the three trials ranged between 6.9% - 24.7%. These rates are relatively low as response rates in excess of 20% are often observed in placebo control treatment arms (Maes, 1996). This implies that the results for STAR*D trials for Level 3 and Level 4 can be considered negative trials.Other independent analyses of STAR*D have highlighted the disappointing outcomes from the study, particularly its low level of sustained improvement during the follow-up (Fava, 2007; Ghaemi, 2008; Pigott, 2010; Pigott, 2011). Unfortunately, the overly favorable interpretations of the results of STAR*D (Gaynes, 2008) have fostered further trial and error, frequently with no solid clinical or scientific rationale.
Off-Label Prescribing
Without an effective physiological measurement to guide treatment of non-psychotic behavioral disorders, particularly treatment resistant disorders like treatment resistant depression, and in light of the poor effectiveness of the approved medications for these disorders, physicians have been forced to consider the utilization of off-label medications to treat these disorders.Off-label use of antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs for the treatment of depression and treatment resistant depression (TRD) is well documented. Radley noted that thirty-one (31%) of all psychotropic treatments prescribed are for off-label indications and upon investigation, 94% of the treatments lacked clinical evidence to support their use for the indications (Radley,2006).   The use of off-label drugs is extensive, despite the lack of appropriate evidence, and among their use in mental health disorders, off-label drugs are used the most for depression. The evidence provided for off-label use of medications for augmentation on antidepressant treatment was overall supportive of the practice with these specific treatment modalities, however Yury et al. noted that more 40% of the most popular classes of augmentation strategies, and 55% of the most frequently prescribed combination of drugs for augmentation of depression have no published scientific support (Yury, 2011). The levels of evidence ranged from 1-4 (see Evidence Table). However, the ‘Level 1’ evidence study, which was a double-blind RCT evaluating the efficacy of risperidone in 386 patients with TRD, reported a remission rate of 63%, but 54% of the patients relapsed. Another study with some notable evidence showed that only 57% of patients receiving olanzapine responded favorably in a chart review.Off-label use of drugs for the treatment resistant disorders is significant enough that clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate and offer support for the off-label use of these medications. The practice of off-label use of medications to treat treatment resistant disorders is so common that in 2007 the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), released a report on a systematic review they conducted on “Efficacy and Comparative Effectiveness of Off-Label Use of Atypical Antipsychotics” (AHRQ; Effective Health Care #6, Executive Summary, 2007) and a subsequent update on the report has been conducted.Although there is some supportive evidence for the use of these off-label medications, there is also a side effect burden that is very significant. In the AHRQ report, they noted that the several of the side effects were more common in the atypical antipsychotics than with placebo, which is not unexpected, but also, that although small, there was a significant increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular accidents in dementia patients.Even though the use of off-label medication is understandable in the void of effective approved medications for many mental disorders, the side effect profile of many of these medications may cause the treatment and cost of the treatment to outweigh the benefit. The continued trial and error process of on-label and off-label medications is expanding the cost of treatment for these patients, without demonstrating any significant improvement in their clinical outcome.
Polypharmacy
Although different authors have defined polypharmacy with different meaning, most often, the definition of polypharmacy is made with regard to the specific number of medication prescribed, and most commonly, it is the use of two or more medications to treat the same condition.There has been a rapid increase in the use of polypharmacy in psychiatry. The reasons may be multifactorial, such as an increasing number of available medications targeting new and different symptoms and receptors, or even the pressure on psychiatrists to focus on medication treatment. Regardless of the reasons, the trend is clear, with psychiatrists now frequently seeing patients presenting on multiple psychiatric medications (Hoffman, 2011).Polypharmacy of difficult psychiatric patients is rapidly becoming the norm. In a study undertaken between 1996 and 2005, psychiatrists significantly increased their use of polypharmacy such that outpatients visits resulting in two or more prescribed psychotropic drugs increased from 42.6% in 1996 to 59.8% in 2005 and psychiatric visits resulting in three or more such drugs being prescribed almost doubled, increasing from 17% to 33% (Mojtabai, 2010).The rationale for polypharmacy or augmentation strategies to enhance retention or to increase remission rates is supported by findings from empirical research. As noted by Yury et al., 2009, most patients with unipolar depression do not remit with initial antidepressant monotherapy; second, no monotherapy medication is robustly different from others in achieving remission; third, the lack of response with antidepressant monotherapy leads to high dropout rates among depressed patients; and fourth, the emergence of adverse side effects (e.g., agitation, insomnia) or persistence of some initial baseline symptoms (e.g., anxiety, insomnia) may lead to premature discontinuation from monotherapy.Yury went on to note that there are significant limitations to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines to the use of augmentation to treat depression. “First, researchers have noted a lack of data to inform the sequence in which augmentation strategies should be implemented or for identifying the types of patients for whom specific strategies might be most helpful (Fava et al., 2003;). Further, it appears that the majority of medications suggested as augmenting agents have no studies, or few examining them as augmenting agents (Thase, 2001). Thus, it is an irony of current psychiatric practice that the most common augmentation strategies for the treatment of depression may be those with the least evidence of efficacy (Thase, 2004).” As emphasized in Pigott et al., 2010, the APA’s continuation phase guideline is profoundly misguided because there is no apparent benefit for most patients from continued antidepressant drug treatment, yet this practice unnecessarily exposes such patients to significant risks.The STAR*D study was a large trail that included some augmentations. In the trial, patients who failed to respond to the step-1 medication and agreed to be randomized to augmentation strategies received either 12 weeks of a step-2 medication added to their step-1 medication. Such augmentation resulted in a 39% remission rate, but with a subsequent relapse of up to 67%. Subsequent augmentation had even lower remission and higher relapse rates. As noted by Yury et al., “one might consider the results to be disappointing and reflect and unfavorable risk-benefit ratio given that about 4% of the patients experienced a serious adverse event from the first augmentation and that about 13% had to discontinue the study because of intolerance of side effects" (Yury, 2009). Even more concerning is that the STAR*D study found that 8.6% of step-1 patients reported an increase in suicide ideation during the acute phase treatment (Perlis, 2007) and in another report (Nierenberg, 2010) 71.3 % who had a remission during the acute-care treatment reported increased weight gain and 71.7% reported residual symptoms of sleep disturbance despite having received remission (Pigott, 2011).Although the practice of polypharmacy is growing and being institutionalized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and virtually mandated by the Affordable Care Act of 2010, there is a growing number of reports and meta-analyses that the practice of polypharmacy is lacking solid evidence of effectiveness, and worse, an increase side effect burden that would off-set any benefit. Both Hoffman and Pigott have recently noted that patients either wash out or off medication may achieve similar benefit to those of polypharmacy (Hoffman, 2011; Pigott, 2011).
PEER Methodology
EEG Collection and Z ScoresThe first step of the assessment is to collect 21-channel, awake, eyes-closed, digital electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings on subjects who have either washed out their medications for five half-lives or who are currently medication free. The results are reviewed in raw form by an electroencephalographer to ensure that there are no abnormalities that would affect the data from going through the referenced-EEG database. The EEG is then screened to remove any “artifacts” that may exist in the EEG record. These artifacts include such things as muscle twitches, eye blinks, and periods of drowsiness.Neurometric analysis involves computation of a series of measures that mathematically describe the EEG. These measures are then compared with a database of “normal” EEGs. There are approximately 1,200 measures derived from the EEG component wavelengths and amplitudes. These measures fall into four main categories, i.e., power, coherence, symmetry, phase and frequency. Power is the sum of the amplitudes of the wavelengths in each band, computed on an absolute and relative basis. Relative power indicates the percentage of total power in each band. Coherence measures the synchronization of electrical activity between two channels. In mathematical terms, coherence is the phase shift between similar wavelengths at the two channels. Symmetry measure the ratio of power between a symmetrical pair of electrodes and, lastly, frequency measure the average frequency of the EEG component wavelengths with each band.Most Neurometric features are highly non-Gaussian in their characteristics. For this reason, the neurometrics are log-transformed to make the distribution more normal (Gaussian) in nature. Many quantitative EEG features also vary consistently with age. To account for the difference between the age of the patient and the age of the subjects in the normative database, these quantitative EEG features are age-regressed using a linear regression equation to yield a “standard-age” quantitative EEG feature. The comparison of the actual values of the Neurometric variables with norms is expressed as a Z score which is defined as:                                                                             Z =  observed value - normative mean                                                                                               standard deviationDevelopment of Pattern VariablesNeurometrics analysis outputs approximately 2,400 variables (known as univariables) that describe the EEG. To make this data utilizable, reference EEG transforms this data into a smaller set of multivariables (or pattern variables). These pattern variables preserve the information contained in the set of quantitative EEG univariables while retaining some degree of physical interpretation. As such, the data are not simply “mined” to come up with combinations of variables that are indicative of one state or another; instead they are combined according to anatomical location. In some cases, factor analysis is employed to give a greater weight to those univariables that preserve the largest amount of total information of all the univariables in an anatomic group. In other cases, the univariables in an anatomic group are combined in a nonlinear fashion to increase the separation of observed clusters within the data. At present there are 74 pattern variables.Correlation of Pattern Variables with Patient OutcomesThe referenced - EEG variables for historical subjects with known positive and negative clinical outcomes to various psychotropic medications are examined in order to develop a model that will allow the prospective determination of likely patient medication responsivity to these medications. The variables are examined by stratifying the distribution according to the individual medication responsivities represented. Before utilizing this apparent relationship, the appropriateness of the pattern variables are checked. Tests of skewness and kurtosis are conducted for each of the pattern variables to ensure that the original variable distribution is Gaussian. Having ensured a Gaussian distribution, mathematics can be applied that provide a comparison of other subjects with similar patterns demonstrating whether the pattern variable value for the current test in question belongs to the distribution represented by a particular medication or belongs to the distribution defined by some other group (the rest of the population). This procedure is done for all medications represented in the database and for all of the pattern variables that serve as indicators for those medications. The weightings then are averaged to calculate a “score” for each medication.Calibration against Patient RecordsThe final step is to calibrate this score against actual patient records to determine what level of score translates into a specified likelihood response to the medication. For purposes of communication, for the PEER Online service, three levels of responsiveness were created. The first is “sensitive” or “S”. This level suggests that the indicated medication, or group of medications, produced a positive outcome to treatment in 80% or more of cases. “Intermediate” or “I”, the second level, indicates that the responsivity was in less than 80% of cases but more than 35% of cases. The third level, “resistive” or “R” indicates that a response to the medication is seen in fewer than 35% of cases. In other terms, if we formulate Ho (the null hypothesis) in such a way that Ho is true if the patient is not actually responsive to the medication, then the model is calibrated to all for a type I error rate of no more that 20% in the region indicated as “S” and a type II error rate of no more that 35% in the region designated as “R”.To calibrate the report generator model against these standards, the outcomes database is queried for all subjects’ responses that were not used in the construction of the actual model. This dataset is known as the validation sample. This sample is then divided into two subsets, the first of which is known as the tuning sample and the second is the final validation sample. To complete the model development, the scoring model is run against the tuning sample and the resulting distribution of scores is compared against the known responses. Thresholds for scores are then empirically set to implement the standards of S, I, and R described above, and which are common in such medical reports as, for example, antibiotic sensitivity results. Final validation of the model is made by running the processes, complete with the thresholds that were set, against the final validation sample. In order to preserve the fully prospective nature of this validation, no adjustment of the model parameters, including the thresholds, is made after this process. If the results of this “run” meet the specifications for the previous clinical correlations, the model is then ready to be used for a new patient.The PEER methodology does not take into account the diagnosis of the patient when offering objective data on any specific medication. Response research has shown, and industry experience corroborates, that diagnosis is often an unreliable predictor of the treatment most likely to be successful for the individual patient. This is one of the fundamental improvements that shared quantitative EEG features correlated to long-term clinical outcomes brings to the practice of psychiatry.This process can provide objective neurophysiologic data to assist in avoiding the unnecessary risk that comes with the practice of trial and error psychopharmacology, which is also seen through the efficiency of treating a patient, thus reducing suffering and medical costs. The report is unique to each patient’s quantitative EEG features.

Why physicians developed PEER
MYnd Analytics's Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry is a cloud-based platform that allows physicians to exchange outcome data referenced to their patients' neurophysiology.   Physicians built this platform, contribute new outcomes as they see patients, and will never be finished building the registry.  Why?  Because it helps them with a significant, practical problem they face every day:“Why are we treating an organ, the brain, without measuring the effect of our treatment on the organ? There are over 100 medications available for the treatment of behavioral disorders. The core problem is not that we need three more, the problem is that we need to know how to use the 100 we have...”Steve Suffin, M.D., Chief of Clinical Pathology, Quest Diagnostics, CNS Response Co-founder"This could revolutionize prescribing practice in terms of helping people get the right treatment sooner. Psychiatry doesn't really have a predictive model for which disorders will respond best to which medications."Col. John Bradley, MD, US Army (Retired), in Newsmax, 5/13"We all respond differently to medications.  I like to see my patients feel better faster without trial and error.  The PEER Report™ shows what medications worked or didn't work for people with similar brains.  I'm pleased to have trained military doctors who also use the PEER Report." Dr. Michael Anderson, Psychiatrist

​Physicians who use PEER reduce trial and error prescribing. Surveys show patients think more highly of physicians who are informed by more personalized information.

	“Trial and Error” prescribing is fine. If you want more trial and error.​











	The secret about drugs is that they only work in about half of the people who take them.



















MYnd Analytics's Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry, or PEER Online, is a cloud-based platform which allows physicians to exchange outcome data referenced to their patients' neurophysiology.

Finding the right medication for an individual patient suffering from mental health issues is one of the biggest challenges facing medical professionals. Most mental health medications are currently prescribed through trial and error, a process that can be detrimental to patients and their families. Medications affect everyone differently, and with over 130 psychotropic medications to choose from, it is difficult for physicians to know which regimen is best. 

PEER Online is a service that allows physicians to compare and learn which medication treatments have been effective, and which have not been effective for their peers treating patients with similar brain patterns. It builds on the company's original physician-developed database, Referenced-EEG® (rEEG®​).

It's based on a transformative idea used to help treat pediatric cancer.  In the 1970's, oncologists treating pediatric cancer developed a registry that helped them network and compare treatment regimens and patient outcomes, in order to advance knowledge of pediatric cancer. The system, which is still in place, enables physicians to learn what works and what does not for treating pediatric cancer, and has significantly improved children's cancer survival and recovery rates. 

As a cloud-based outcome registry, PEER Online provides the same kind of vital exchange of information between medical professionals treating patients with mental health issues.

	at the time they are made and/or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject
	to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested
	by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

	carefully, including the risks of investing in our securities discussed under the section of this prospectus entitled "Risk
	Factors" and similar headings in the other documents that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. You should also

	Overview




	 



	The Company is a predictive analytics company
	that has developed a decision support tool to help physicians reduce trial and error treatment in mental health and provide more
	personalized care to patients. The Company provides objective clinical decision support to physicians for the personalized treatment
	of behavioral disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) and
	other non-psychotic disorders. While treatment for mental disorders has doubled in the last 20 years, it is estimated that 17 million
	Americans have failed two or more medication therapies for their mental disorders. The Company’s Psychiatric EEG Evaluation
	Registry has more than 38,000 outcomes for over 10,400 unique patients in the PEER registry.


	 


	The latest clinical results showed patients
	of physicians that utilized the PEER recommendations (report) to make treatment decisions had a 144% improvement in depression
	scores and a 75% greater reduction in suicidality. By comparison, a 1% increase in suicidality among children and young adults
	was sufficient to cause the addition of black box warning labels by the FDA for all antidepressants.  Finally, treatments
	which followed PEER recommendations resulted in 2.5 times greater adherence to therapy.


	 


	The Company is planning to commercialize its
	PEER Report by focusing on the following four areas: (i) payer managed care market; (ii) provider group direct market; (iii) patient
	direct; and (iv) military and veterans in the US and the Canadian Armed Forces, which will provide both NATO and Health Canada
	experience with our PEER technology. The Company has been designated an Emerging Technology by United Healthcare, permitting limited
	reimbursement, and recently received CMS certification in California to bill Medicare as a jump start to commercializing its product
	in California. The EEG test is non-invasive, and PEER Reports are available same-day at a total cost of $800.00.

	Risk Factors




	 



	Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. For a discussion of factors to consider before deciding to invest in shares of our Common Stock, you should carefully review and consider the "Risk Factors" section of this prospectus, as well as the risk factors described or referred to in any documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and in any applicable prospectus supplement.

	Risk
	Factors





	 




	Investing in MYnd Analytics
	involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the risks
	and uncertainties described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	year ended September 30, 2016, as updated in our Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q, which descriptions are incorporated by reference
	in this prospectus in their entirety, as well as any risks and uncertainties described in any applicable prospectus supplement,
	before making an investment in our Common Stock. These risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties we face.
	Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors
	that affect us. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or in any of our other SEC filings or any additional risks
	and uncertainties actually arise or occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely
	affected. In that case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.



	 




	We will need to raise
	substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on
	acceptable terms.




	 


	We had approximately $1.05
	million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016. On average, we expended approximately $250,000 of cash per month during
	the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Cash used in operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.0
	million. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital after we exhaust our current cash.


	 


	When we elect to raise
	additional funds or additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings,
	debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives, as well as through sales of
	Common Stock to Aspire Capital Fund, LLC ("Aspire Capital") under a common stock purchase agreement between us and Aspire
	Capital, dated as of December 6, 2016 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which Aspire Capital is committed to purchase
	up to an aggregate of $10 million of our Common Stock (on any trading day that our stock price does not close below $0.50 per share)
	over the 30-month term of the Purchase Agreement.


	 


	Additional equity or debt
	financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are
	unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing acquisition,
	licensing, development and commercialization efforts and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability
	will be substantially harmed.


	 


	If we raise additional
	funds by issuing equity securities (including in connection with this offering or pursuant to the Purchase Agreement), our stockholders
	will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements
	that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
	capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation
	and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and
	licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue
	streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Should the financing we require to
	sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results,
	financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations.


	 






	There is
	no guarantee that we will successfully have our Common Stock listed on the NASDAQ. Even if our Common Stock is accepted
	for listing on the NASDAQ upon our satisfaction of the exchange’s initial listing criteria, NASDAQ may subsequently
	delist our Common Stock.






	 




	In the event we are able to list our Common
	Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market upon our satisfaction of the exchange’s initial listing criteria, NASDAQ will require us to meet certain financial,
	public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our Common Stock. If we
	fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our Common Stock may be subject to delisting. If our Common Stock is delisted
	and we are not able to list our Common Stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted
	on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including
	limited availability of market quotations for our Common Stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition,
	we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future. Even if our
	Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock
	will develop or be sustained after our initial listing.

	DETERMINATION OF THE OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The public offering price of the Common Stock
	offered by this prospectus was determined by careful consideration of our management and our Board of Directors, based upon: (i)
	an analysis of trading in the Common Stock as reported on the OTCQB; (ii) the recognition that the current trading price of Common
	Stock as reported on the OTCQB may not be fully indicative of its true value due to the limited public float of the Common Stock;
	(iii) the limited liquidity of securities trading on the OTCQB, as compared to securities trading on a national securities exchange;
	and (iv) the Common Stock's limited historical trading volume. In considering and determining the price at which to offer Common
	Stock in this offering, our management and our Board of Directors also considered the prices at which private investors had offered
	to purchase Common Stock from us over the past year. Finally, our management and our Board of Directors considered discussions
	with, and advice provided by, independent brokers and investors relating to their opinions of the price at which we could succeed
	in attracting investors for this offering. We cannot provide assurances that we will succeed in attracting any investors at the
	public offering price of the Common Stock offered by this prospectus, that the public offering price is in fact reflective of the
	true value of our Common Stock, or of us, or that the markets will react positively following any such offers and sales by us of
	our Common Stock.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	We will retain broad discretion
	over the use of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered by us hereby. We currently intend to use the net proceeds
	from the sale of the securities offered by us hereunder, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including
	advancement of our PEER product.

	DILUTION




	 



	As
	of December 31, 2016, we had a net tangible book value of $[●] or $[●] per share, based on 2,261,061 of common
	stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016.  Net tangible book value represents our total tangible assets of the
	Company, less all liabilities and intangible assets, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. Without
	taking into account any changes in such net tangible book value after December 31, 2016, other than to give effect to our
	sale of [●] shares of common stock offered hereby at a fixed price of $[●] per share, the pro forma net tangible
	book value per share at December 31, 2016 was $[●]. This amount represents an immediate increase in net tangible book
	value of $[●] per share to our current shareholders and an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $[●]
	per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering.


	 


	The table set forth
	below shows the calculation of the increase in book value to current shareholders and the decrease in offering price to investors
	in this offering.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We
	are publicly offering [●] shares of our Common Stock on a “best efforts” basis at a fixed per share price of
	$[●]. The offering will be made directly by the Company, through its officers, directors and through participating brokers
	that are members of FINRA, and/or other persons exempt from the broker-dealer registration, both of which we refer to collectively
	herein as "participating brokers."  Because this is a “best efforts,” self-underwritten, offering,
	participating brokers will use only their best efforts to sell our shares and have no firm commitment or obligation to purchase
	any of our shares. As of the date hereof, the Company has not entered into any underwriting agreement, or any other agreement,
	arrangement, or understanding with any brokers or dealers.  The Company has not yet determined which brokers or dealers,
	if any, will participate in the offering or the amount of securities to be offered through each.  The Company intends
	to pay commission standard in the industry to the brokers and dealers who participate in the offering.


	 


	Pursuant
	to Rule 415(a)(1)(ix), this is a continuous offering that will commence promptly upon effectiveness and will continue for more
	than 30 days. There is no minimum investment amount for individual investors. Participating brokers in the offering are required
	to deliver a copy of the prospectus to each potential investor. We plan to make this prospectus, the subscription agreement, certain
	offering documents, administrative and transfer forms, as well as certain marketing materials, available electronically to participating
	brokers as an alternative to paper copies. An investor may receive a paper copy of these documents upon request. If a participating
	broker electronically delivers such documents to an investor, then the participating broker will be responsible for complying with
	all applicable requirements of the SEC, FINRA and any laws or regulations related to such electronic delivery. 


	 


	We
	may agree to indemnify participating brokers against liabilities to which they may become subject, under the Securities Act of
	1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or otherwise, based upon or arising out of (i) an untrue statement of a material
	fact contained in any approved sales literature, this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part,
	or any amendment or supplement thereof; or (ii) an omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated,
	or necessary to make the statement not misleading, in approved sales literature, this prospectus or the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part, or any amendment or supplement thereto. We expect to require any participating brokers to agree
	to severally indemnify us, our officers and directors against liabilities to which we may become subject, under the Securities
	Act or otherwise, based upon or arising out of: (i) an untrue statement of a material fact made by any participating broker to
	any offeree or purchaser of our shares of stock (other than any statement contained in any approved sales literature or this prospectus,
	or any amendment or supplement thereto); or (ii) an omission or alleged omission by any participating broker to state a material
	fact required to be stated, or necessary to make the statement not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were
	made, to any offeree or purchaser of our shares (other than any material fact omitted from any approved sales literature or this
	prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto). However, the SEC and some state securities commissions take the position that
	indemnification against liabilities arising under the Securities Act is against public policy and is unenforceable.


	 


	The
	offering will commence on the date of this prospectus and close at the discretion of the management. Our Common Stock will be sold
	in accordance with the laws of the states in which the Common Stock is offered and/or sold. 


	 


	Our
	officers and directors, as applicable, will sell the shares directly with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for
	any shares of Common Stock they sell. In offering the securities on our behalf, our officers and directors will rely on the safe
	harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).


	 


	Our
	officers and directors will not register as broker-dealers pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance
	upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions under which a person associated with an issuer may participate in the offering
	of the issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer.  Our officers and directors satisfy the requirements of
	Rule 3a4-1, because they are officers and directors, respectively, of the Company and:


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 





	(a)  




	are not subject to a "statutory disqualification", as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39)of the Act, at the time of their participation; and





	 





	(b)  




	will not be compensated in connection with their participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and





	 





	(c)  




	are not, nor will they  be at the time of their participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and





	 





	(d)  




	meet the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that they (A) primarily perform, or are intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) are not brokers or dealers, or have not been associated persons of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) have not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii).





	 


	At
	such time as our registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we may advertise, through tombstones, and hold investment
	meetings. Our officers and directors will also distribute the prospectus to potential investors who are interested in us and a
	possible investment in this offering. No shares of Common Stock purchased in this offering will be subject to any kind of lock-up
	agreement.


	 


	Our
	securities may be sold to purchasers both inside and outside the United States.


	 



	Regulation M



	 


	Our
	officers and directors, who will sell the shares, are aware that they are required to comply with the provisions of Regulation
	M, promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes
	officers and/or directors, sales agents, any broker-dealers or other person who participate in the distribution of shares in this
	offering from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject
	of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete.

	ITEM 14.  Indemnification of Directors
	and Officers.



	 


	The Delaware General Corporation
	Law and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws under certain circumstances provide for indemnification
	of our officers, directors and controlling persons against liabilities which they may incur in such capacities.  A summary
	of the circumstances in which such indemnification is provided for is contained herein, but this description is qualified in its
	entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and to the statutory provisions.


	 


	In general, any officer,
	director, employee or agent may be indemnified against expenses, fines, settlements or judgments arising in connection with a legal
	proceeding to which such person is a party, if that person’s actions were in good faith, were believed to be in our best
	interest, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person had no reasonable cause to believe their actions were
	unlawful.  Unless such person is successful upon the merits in such an action, indemnification may be awarded only after
	a determination by independent decision of the board of directors, by legal counsel, or by a vote of the stockholders, that the
	applicable standard of conduct was met by the person to be indemnified.


	 


	The circumstances under
	which indemnification is granted in connection with an action brought on our behalf is generally the same as those set forth above;
	however, with respect to such actions, indemnification is granted only with respect to expenses actually incurred in connection
	with the defense or settlement of the action.  In such actions, unless the court determines otherwise, the person to
	be indemnified must have acted in good faith and in a manner believed to have been in our best interest, and have not been adjudged
	liable to the corporation.


	 


	Indemnification may also
	be granted pursuant to the terms of agreements which we are currently party to with each of our directors and executive officers,
	agreements which we may enter into in the future or pursuant to a vote of stockholders or directors.  Delaware law and
	our certificate of incorporation also grant the power to us to purchase and maintain insurance which protects our officers and
	directors against any liabilities incurred in connection with their service in such a position, and such a policy may be obtained
	by us.


	 


	A stockholder’s investment
	may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required
	by these indemnification provisions.  There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers
	or employees regarding which indemnification by us is sought, nor are we aware of any threatened litigation that may result in
	claims for indemnification.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to
	the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy
	as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	solicitation or advertisement.

	s proměnným základním kapitálem ("RSJ PE"). Pursuant to the Original Note Purchase Agreement,
	the Company issued fifteen secured convertible promissory notes (each, a "September 2014 Note") in the aggregate principal
	amount of $2.29 million. Of this amount, RSJ PE purchased a September 2014 Note for $750,000. Michal Votruba, a Director for Life
	Sciences for the RSJ/Gradus Fund, subsequently joined our Board on July 30, 2015. The September 2014 Notes were also purchased
	by four additional affiliates of the Company

	(refer to the Note Issuance and Conversion Table below).



	 


	  The Original Note
	Purchase Agreement provided for the issuance and sale of September 2014 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to $2.5 million,
	in one or more closings to occur over a six-month period beginning September 22, 2014. The Original Note Purchase Agreement also
	provided that the Company and the holders of the September 2014 Notes enter into a registration rights agreement covering the registration
	of the resale of the shares of the Common Stock underlying the September 2014 Notes.


	 


	On April 14, 2015, the
	Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original Note Purchase Agreement with the majority of the noteholders in principal,
	dated as of April 14, 2015 ("Amendment No. 1"), pursuant to which: (i) the aggregate principal amount of notes provided
	for issuance was increased by $0.5 million to a total of $3.0 million, and (ii) the period to raise the $3.0 million was extended
	to September 30, 2015. The Company subsequently amended and restated the Original Note Purchase Agreement solely to update for
	the changes made pursuant to Amendment No. 1 (such amended and restated agreement, together with the Original Note Purchase Agreement,
	the "Note Purchase Agreement").


	 


	On September 14, 2015,
	the Company entered into an Omnibus Amendment (the "Omnibus Amendment") to the Note Purchase Agreement and the notes
	purchased and sold pursuant thereto, with the majority of the noteholders to fix the conversion price of all notes at $10.00 per
	share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or the like affecting the Common Stock) (the "Fixed Conversion
	Price") (i) automatically, in the event of a qualified financing of not less than $5 million, or (ii) voluntarily, within
	15 days prior to the maturity date of the note. The Omnibus Amendment also amended the form of note attached to the Note Purchase
	Agreement to reflect the Fixed Conversion Price.

	Subsequently thereto, on
	September 14, 15 and 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, as amended by the Omnibus Amendment, with each
	of six accredited investors, in connection with a bridge financing. Pursuant to these Note Purchase Agreements, the Company issued
	an aggregate principal amount of $710,000 of secured convertible promissory notes (collectively, the "September 2015 Notes,"
	and together with the September 2014 Notes and all other notes purchased and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the
	"Notes"), which amount also represents the gross proceeds to the Company from the September 2015 Notes. Four of the six
	September 2015 Notes were purchased by affiliates of the Company, or an entity under such affiliate’s control

	(refer to
	the Note Issuance and Conversion Table below)



	 


	Through December 23, 2015,
	and prior to further amendments to the Notes, all of the Notes were scheduled to mature on March 21, 2016, (subject to earlier
	conversion or prepayment), and earned interest at a rate of 5% per annum with interest payable at maturity. The Notes could not
	be prepaid without the prior written consent of the holder of such Notes. The Notes were secured by a security interest in the
	Company’s intellectual property, as detailed in a security agreement. Upon a change of control of the Company, the holder
	of a Note had the option to have the Note repaid with a premium equal to 50% of the outstanding principal.


	  


	On December 23, 2015, the
	Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (which further amended and restated the
	Note Purchase Agreement, as modified by the Omnibus Amendment) (the "Second Amended Note & Warrant Agreement") with
	each of 16 accredited investors, pursuant to which (i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes available for issuance was increased
	from $3.0 million to up to $6.0 million, (ii) the maturity date of the Notes outstanding prior to such amendment was extended from
	March 21, 2016 to December 31, 2017, (iii) the time during which Notes may be issued was extended and (iv) certain warrants were
	issued to holders of both previously issued and Notes issued under the Second Amended Note & Warrant Agreement.


	 


	Pursuant to the Second
	Amended Note & Warrant Agreement, on December 23 and December 28, 2015, the Company issued to the two purchasers thereof, who
	are both affiliates

	(refer to the Note Issuance and Conversion Table below)

	of the Company, (i) an aggregate principal amount
	of $1,000,000 of secured convertible promissory notes (each, a "December 2015 Note"), which amount also represents the
	gross proceeds to the Company from the December 2015 Notes, and (ii) a Note Warrant to each holder of December 2015 Notes to purchase
	the Company's Common Stock, in an amount equal to 100% of the shares underlying their December 2015 Note (each, a "Note Warrant").
	Each Note Warrant was exercisable, in whole or in part, during the period beginning on the date of its issuance, and ending on
	the earlier of (i) December 31, 2020 and (ii) the date that was forty-five (45) days following the date on which the daily closing
	price of shares of the Company's Common Stock quoted on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace (or other bulletin board or exchange on which
	the Company's Common Stock is traded or listed) exceeded $50.00 for at least ten (10) consecutive trading days. The Note Warrants
	were subsequently cancelled. For additional details on cancellation of the Note Warrants, see "

	―Note Conversion and
	Warrant Cancellation

	" below.


	 


	Between February 23, 2016
	and June 30, 2016, the Company issued to seven accredited investor purchasers thereof (i) an aggregate principal amount of $1,100,000
	in eight separate Notes and (ii) a warrant to each holder of such Notes to purchase the Company's Common Stock, in an amount equal
	to 100% of the shares underlying their respective Note (each, also a "Note Warrant"). A total of 110,000 shares of Common
	Stock in the aggregate were underlying these Note Warrants. Five of the purchasers were affiliates of the Company

	(refer to
	the Note Issuance and Conversion Table below).

	The Note Warrants were subsequently cancelled. For additional details on cancellation
	of the Note Warrants, see "

	―Note Conversion and Warrant Cancellation

	" below.


	 


	Also on December 23, 2015,
	in consideration for the agreement to extend the maturity date of the Notes, the Company issued to holders of all Notes outstanding
	prior to the date of the Second Amended Note & Warrant Agreement, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 300,000 shares of Common
	Stock (the "Extension Warrants", together with the Note Warrants, the "Warrants"). All Warrants had identical
	terms. Each such holder was issued an Extension Warrant to purchase Common Stock in an amount equal to 100% of the shares underlying
	each such holder's previously outstanding Notes. Extension Warrants were issued to affiliates

	(refer to the Note Issuance and
	Conversion Table below).

	All Note Warrants and Extension Warrants were subsequently cancelled upon conversion of the Notes.
	For additional details on cancellation of the Warrants, see "

	―Note Conversion and Warrant Cancellation

	"
	below.


	 


	On August 15, 2016, the
	Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Second Amended Note and Warrant Agreement with the investors party thereto to extend
	the time during which the Notes and the Warrants could be issued under the Second Amended Note and Warrant Agreement from August
	11, 2016 to September 1, 2016.



	 







	 


	II-

	On September 19, 2016,
	the Company entered into a Second Omnibus Amendment (the "Second Omnibus Amendment"), with a majority of over 80% of
	the noteholders, thereby amending: (i) the Notes, (ii) the Second Amended Note and Warrant Agreement, as amended and (iii) the
	Warrants. Pursuant to the Second Omnibus Amendment, the Company had the option, exercisable at any time after September 1, 2016,
	to mandatorily convert all Notes into shares of the Company's common stock at $5.00 per share (the "Mandatory Conversion").


	 



	Note Conversion and Warrant Cancellation



	 


	On September 19, 2016,
	pursuant to the Second Omnibus Amendment, the Company exercised the Mandatory Conversion and, on September 21, 2016, (i) converted
	the entire outstanding principal balance of $6,000,000, plus accrued interest of $317,000 on all of the Notes into 1,263,406 shares
	of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share and (ii) cancelled all Warrants.

	On November 30, 2016, the
	Company entered into a subscription agreement with six accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold and issued an aggregate
	of 160,000 shares of its Common Stock in a private placement, at a per share price of $6.25, and received gross cash proceeds of
	$1,000,000. Aspire Capital purchased an aggregate of 40,000 shares of Common Stock for $250,000 as part of this private placement.
	Three of the six accredited investors who participated in the private placement were affiliates who represented 50% of the cash
	proceeds as follows: Dr. Robin Smith, our Chairman of the Board, purchased 16,000 shares for $100,000; John Pappajohn, a member
	of the Board, purchased 32,000 shares for $200,000; and the Tierney Family Trust, of which our Board member, Thomas Tierney is
	a trustee, purchased 32,000 shares for $200,000. In connection with this private placement, certain investors (comprised of our
	executive officers and current and former directors) agreed to a 180-day “lock-up”, commencing on November 30, 2016,
	with respect to shares of Common Stock and other of our securities that they beneficially own, including securities that are convertible
	into shares of Common Stock and securities that are exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock. As a result, subject
	to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days following November 30, 2016, such persons may not offer, sell, pledge or otherwise
	dispose of these securities without the Company's prior written consent.


	 


	On December 21, 2016, the
	Company sold and issued a further 48,000 shares of its Common Stock, at a per share price of $6.25, in a private placement to four
	accredited investors who were new to the Company, for which it received gross cash proceeds of $300,000.


	 


	On March 20, 2017, the
	Company entered into a subscription agreement with RSJ Investments SICAV a.s. ("RSJ") pursuant to which the Company sold
	and issued an aggregate of 160,000 shares of Common Stock, at a price of $6.25 per share, in a private placement to RSJ, for which
	the Company received gross cash proceeds of $1,000,000. RSJ is a greater than 10% shareholder of the Company and Michal Votruba,
	a Director for Life Sciences at the RSJ/Gradus Fund, has served as a member of the Company's Board of Directors since July 30,
	2015. The subscription agreement between the Company and RSJ provided for the grant to RSJ by the Company of a right of first refusal
	through June 30, 2018, to license or have distribution rights in Europe with respect to any of the Company’s technology and/or
	intellectual property.

	ITEM 17.  Undertakings

	.


	 


	(a) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(1) to file, during any period in which offers
	or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:


	 


	(i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the
	Securities Act;


	 


	(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts
	or events arising after the effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof)
	which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the Registration Statement.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities
	offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering
	range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes
	in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation
	of Registration Fee” table in the effective Registration Statement; and


	 


	(iii) to include any material information with
	respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any material change to such information
	in the Registration Statement;


	 


	provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i),
	(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs
	is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of
	the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.


	 






	 


	II-

	6



	 







	 




	 


	(2) that, for the purpose of determining any
	liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating
	to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
	offering thereof.


	 


	(3) to remove from registration by means of
	a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 




	(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant
	under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned Registrant undertakes
	that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this Registration Statement, regardless of the
	underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means
	of any of the following communications, the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to
	offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i) any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned
	Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii) any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared
	by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;


	 


	(iii) the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating
	to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of
	the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) any other communication that is an offer in the offering
	made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	 


	(b) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes
	that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrant's annual report pursuant
	to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual
	report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall be
	deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
	time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to
	the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	 




	(d) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:


	 


	(1) for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities
	Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A
	and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities
	Act shall be deemed to be part of this Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective.


	 


	(2) for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment
	that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,
	and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

Analytics "THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS" 





Analytics

				Use analytics to lead your successful digital transformation.
            





					Data analytics extracts insights  from large amounts of data and turns it into value.
					We at Hitachi can help you move through the digital  transformation of your business.
				





                        Digital transformation is essential for companies to continually enhance their corporate value. This shift combines analysis and simulation, reflecting real world scenarios in a digital context. The process dramatically accelerates the actualization of business ideas and is the foundation of continuous improvement.
                    

                        Data analytics create new value by extracting insights  from large amounts of data. Repeating these analytics in short cycles allows you to further accelerate the speed of your improvements and gain new abilities, ultimately leading to significant innovations.
                    

                        At Hitachi, we support digital transformation through long-term co-creation with our clients. It’s part of our commitment to you to solve your business problems and create new value.
                    





                    Our analytics are already accelerating the digital transformation of clients in many business fields.
                

                	Engineering work and expertise can now be automated and passed on to others through digitization and data analytics.
				





                        Engineering expertise plays a vital role in optimizing manufacturing work and formulating production plans. But because it is highly specialized, this knowledge has always been difficult to define and apply to wider, more efficient uses. Now, through the continuous analysis made possible by Hitachi analytics, your company is able to automate and digitize this expertise to use it in more areas of your business. For example, we helped a manufacturing company digitally reproduce 86%  of the work involved in formulating production plans that was previously done by proficient  engineers. As a result, they were able to raise quality and shorten development cycles in more areas of their business.   It’s just one of the many challenges Hitachi has taken on as we continue to find new opportunities in automation.
                    





                	Facilities and equipment serve as the foundation of many industries. You can implement effective prevention and maintenance measures by discovering early signs of failure through an analysis of operational data.
				





                        All businesses rely on the efficiency of their facilities and equipment. In order to operate at the highest efficiency, organizations must minimize the downtime caused by malfunctions and other factors. With analytics, we’re able to proactively predict failures by collecting and analyzing the data from these operational technologies. By implementing prevention and maintenance measures before mishaps occur, we can help make the best operational use of facilities, equipment and even whole businesses.
                    





					Damages from increasing numbers of security breaches can be minimized by time series analysis of a wide variety of data.
                





                        According to the report, Global State of Information Security , worldwide security incidents increased 38% in 2015 compared to the previous year. These breaches result in an astounding economic loss of hundreds of billion dollars per year. To help protect you from these catastrophic damages, our first step is to determine the causes of security threats. We do this with time series analysis through a comprehensive process that merges a variety of data from many different sources of information.
                    





                   Hitachi’s analytics are supported by diverse technologies and physical support
