What are analysts saying about Flextronics International stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Flextronics International stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Flex's diverse end-market and expanding partner base is positive. The company has evolved into an end-to-end solutions provider, which expands its total addressable market (TAM) significantly. Its increasing focus on fast growing end-markets like converged enterprise and cloud are key catalysts going forward. However, the company’s business model has shifted toward a higher mix of businesses that possess longer product life cycles and higher operating margins, which has negatively impacted top-line growth. Nevertheless, it has benefited operating margin, which bodes well for the stock. Meanwhile, estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's Q1 earnings release. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. Notably, Flex has underperformed the broader Zacks industry on a year-to-date basis." (7/12/2017)
2. Royal Bank Of Canada analysts commented, "FLEX reported Dec-qtr results and guided Marqtr largely inline with expectations. The notable standout was strong FCF generation ($363M or $0.66/share) in Dec-qtr that highlights the strong FCF generation of this model as investors await benefits of multiple new ramps ' Nike, Bose, and other non-tech (consumer and healthcare) programs. We continue to expect in CY17 FLEX will see modest revenue growth (tech flat to down, but non-tech up double digits) and steady margin, EPS and FCF growth. We expect Nike program at volume to be $1B + revenues (2 years away) and generate op-margins of 8-10%. Maintain OP but modestly raising our estimates and adjusting our target to $17 (prior $16)." (1/27/2017)
3. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Over the past few years, the mix at FLEX has been transitioning quite a bit while providing a more sustainable source of income generation. This is a dynamic we expect to continue as non-traditional segments (IEI & HRS) have solid long-term opportunities in under-penetrated markets while segments such as CTG are overhauled into next-gen and higher tech (i.e., Nike and Bose ramps); both bring very healthy income opportunities. In the big picture, we see an improving model in terms of diversity and a solid pathway toward accelerated income growth. Consequently, we reiterate our Buy and bump our target up slightly." (1/27/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Flextronics International (NASDAQ:FLEX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy Ratings, 2 Strong Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $17.14 (2.37% upside)
