Anthony Morris, a federal vaccine specialist who was forced into retirement after public disagreements with superior officers over the efficiency of federal vaccine programs and the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, died May 31 at a health-care center in Hyattsville, Md. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Cam Esser. Dr. Morris was chief vaccine officer for the Bureau of Biological Standards at the National Institutes of Health and later with the Food and Drug Administration, when the bureau was transferred to that agency in the 1970s. He argued that research carried out by his unit demonstrated that there was no reliable proof that vaccines were effective in preventing influenza, and he accused the government of basing its mass vaccine programs for flu primarily on claims made by pharmaceutical manufacturers. The issue came to a head in 1976 when President Gerald R. Ford signed a bill appropriating $135 million to vaccinate 140 million people against swine flu that fall and the next winter. Dr. Morris was outspoken in his opposition to the inoculations. Subsequent events seemed to support Dr. Morris’s skepticism. The 1976 swine flu vaccinations were fraught with problems, and the government discontinued the inoculations after 49 million had received the vaccine. The incidence of swine flu among the vaccinated was seven times greater than it was among those who had not been vaccinated, according to news reports. In addition, 12 Americans who had been vaccinated against swine flu died of complications related to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a polyneuropathy affecting the peripheral nervous system. More than 200 were paralyzed, news accounts said. The swine-flu episode coincided with continuing long-term insubordination proceedings against Dr. Morris related to his disagreements within his agency over the administration of vaccines, not only flu vaccines, but also polio and vaccines against the common cold. In the early 1970s, with his lawyer, James Turner, Dr. Morris compiled a list of what they said were blunders and inefficiencies in the testing and licensing of vaccines, which he said cast doubt on their value to the public. It was sent to Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff (D-Conn.), who headed a Senate subcommittee that had oversight of the NIH. Ribicoff made the list public. A federally appointed investigatory panel found “only a few minor irregularities” that “did not involve any risk to the public.” The investigating panel also observed, “It is evident that there are serious personnel problems within the DBS and that the current charges are the culmination of a long series of such problems.” The disciplinary case against Dr. Morris continued and included such accusations as failure to return library books on time, Turner said. In 1980, Dr. Morris was forced to retire but retained all retirement benefits. After leaving federal service, Dr. Morris was self-employed as a consultant to people who had been harmed or injured by vaccine inoculations. Joseph Anthony Morris was born Sept. 6, 1918, in Upper Marlboro, Md. At Catholic University, he received a master’s degree and a doctorate in microbiology in the 1940s. Shortly thereafter, he began his career as a federal health officer. He was a 65-year resident of Greenbelt, Md., and moved to the health-care facility in Hyattsville a year and a half ago. Survivors include his wife of 71 years, Ruth Savoy Morris of Hyattsville; four children, Cam Esser of Annandale, Va., Marilyn Stoughton of Columbia, Md., Joseph Anthony Morris Jr. of Berwyn Heights, Md., and Lawrence Morris of Accokeek, Md.; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

[2010 Sept] On the matter of Dr Anthony J Morris by Hilary Butler
[2010 April] Little 
porkies and big porkies by Hilary Butler



He informed America, on Phil Donahue�s show, that he had 
been responsible for the testing of the Swine flu vaccine; that it could cause 
serious allergic and neurological reactions; had a very low potency, and was 
completely unnecessary as the virus concerned was an ordinary pig virus, and not 
highly pathogenic, and had died out within two weeks of it�s being detected in 
February, and had not been seen anywhere else. 
[2009 Sept] 
Dear Dr Friedlander (re Dr J. Anthony Morris)
"There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is 
effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of 
these vaccines know that they are worthless, but they go on selling them, 
anyway."------Dr. J. Anthony Morris (formerly Chief Vaccine Control Officer at 
the FDA)
In A REPORT TO THE CONSUMER (Sept., 75) by Ida Honorof, she presents a
compilation of data from the National Institute of HealthDivision of Biologic
Standards, Bulletin of World Health Organization, and Dr. J. Anthony Morris, former
Director of a branch of FDA Virus research. Dr. Morris findings show that the flu
vaccine, when inhaled by lab. animals "tended to enhance cancerous tumors." Pregnant women had been on the preferred list for shots until findings
indicated that certain substances in flu vaccine "could pose a serious threat of
fetal damage to women who might become pregnant. . ." [Book] Swine Flu Expose by Eleanora I. McBean, Ph.D., N.D.
In what is now known as "the Great Swine Flu Massacre," the 
President of the United States, Gerald Ford, was enlisted to persuade the public 
to undergo a national vaccination campaign. The moving force behind the scheme 
was a $135 million windfall profit for the major drug manufacturers. They had a 
"swine flu" vaccine which suspicious pig raisers had refused to touch, fearful 
it might wipe out their crop. The manufacturers had only tried to get $80 
million from the swine breeders; balked in this sale, they turned to the other 
market, humans. The impetus for the national swine flu vaccine came directly 
from the Disease Control Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Perhaps coincidentally, 
Jimmy Carter, a member of the Trilateral Commission, was then planning his 
presidential campaign in Georgia. The incumbent 
President, Gerald Ford, had all the advantages of a massive bureaucracy to aid 
him in his election campaign, while the ineffectual and little known. Jimmy 
Carter offered no serious threat to the election. Suddenly, out of Atlanta, came 
the Centre for Disease Control plan for a national 
immunization campaign against "swine flu." The fact 
that there was not a single known case of this flu in 
the United States did not deter the Medical Monopoly from their
scheme. The swine breeders had been shocked by the
demonstrations of the vaccine on a few pigs, which had
collapsed and died. One can imagine the anxious 
inferences in the headquarters of the great drug firms, until 
one bright young man remarked, "Well, if the swine 
breeders won't inject it into their animals, our only 
other market is to inject it into people."
    The Ford-sponsored swine flu 
campaign almost died an early death, when a conscientious public servant, Dr. 
Anthony Morris, formerly of HEW and then active as director of the Virus Bureau 
of the Food and Drug Administration, declared that there could be no authentic 
swine flu vaccine, because there had never been any cases of swine flu on which 
they could test it. Dr. Morris then went public with his statement that "at no 
point were the swine flu vaccines effective." He was promptly fired, but the 
damage had been done. The damage control consisted of that great humanitarian, 
Walter Cronkite, and the President of the United States, combining their forces 
to come to the rescue of the Medical Monopoly. Walter Cronkite had President 
Ford appear on his news program to urge the American people to submit to the 
inoculation with the swine flu vaccine. CBS then or later could never find any 
reason to air any analysis or scientific critique of the swine flu vaccine, 
which was identified as containing many toxic poisons, including alien viral 
protein panicles, formal�dehyde, thimerosal (a 
derivative of poisonous mer�cury), polysorbate and some eighty other substances. 
Meanwhile, back at the virus laboratories, after Dr. Anthony Morris has been 
summarily fired, a special team of workers was rushed in to clean out the four 
rooms in which he had conducted his scientific tests. The laboratory was filled 
with animals whose records verified his claims, representing some three yean of 
constant research. All of thr animals were immediately destroyed, and Morris' 
records were burned. They did net go so far as to sow 
salt throughout the area, because they believed their job was done.
    On April I5, 
1976, Congress passed Public Law 94-266, which provided $135 million of 
taxpayers' funds to pay for a national swine flu inoculation campaign. HEW was 
to distribute the vaccine to state and local health agencies on a national basis 
for inoculation, at no charge. Insurance agencies then went public with their 
warning that they would not insure drug firms against possible studies from the 
results of swine flu inoculation, because no studies had been carried out which 
could predict its effects. It was to foil the insurance companies that CBS had 
Gerald Ford make his impassioned appeal to 215,000,000 Americans to save 
themselves while there was still time, and to rush down to the friendly local 
health department and get the swine flu vaccination, at absolutely no charge. 
This may have been CBS' finest hour in its distinguished career of "public 
service."
    Hardly had the swine flu campaign 
been completed than the reports of the casualties began to pour in. Within a few 
months, claims totalling $1.3 billion had been filed by victims who had suffered 
paralysis from the swine flu vaccine. The medical authorities proved equal to 
the challenge; they leaped to the defense of the Medical Monopoly by labeling 
the new epidemic, "Guillain-Barre Syndrome." There have since been increasing 
speculations that the ensuing epidemic of AIDS which began shortly after Gerald 
Ford's public assurances, were merely a viral variation of the swine flu 
vaccine. And what of the perpetrator of the Great Swine Flu Massacre, President 
Gerald Ford? As the logical person to blame for the catastrophe, Ford had to 
endure a torrent of public criticism, which quite natu�rally resulted in his 
defeat for election (he had previ�ously been appointed when the agents of the 
interna�tional drag operations had ushered Richard Nixon out of office). The 
unknown Jimmy Carter, familiar only to the supersecret 
fellow members of the Trilateral Commission, was swept into office by the 
outpouring of rage against Gerald Ford. Carter proved to be almost as serious a 
national disaster as the swine flu epidemic, while Gerald Ford was retired from 
politics to life. Not only did he lose the election, he was also sentenced to 
spend his remaining years trudging wearily up and down the hot sandy stretches 
of the Palm Springs Golf course. --Eustace 
Mullins

Public Records Now can help you learn about an individual’s past using the criminal records check feature on the site.  Our goal is to collect information from a variety of sources and put it all together into an intensive report that summarizes what the individual has in their background.  Every report will have specific details regarding any crimes an individual might have committed or been involved in. The report will also include their age, gender, name and any identifiable markings.
When the information is available, the report will include:

The offense that was charged
The location of where the offense occurred
Whether the offense was a misdemeanor or a felony
Whether the individual was actually convicted of the crime or not
What the risk level is for any sex offenders

Overview of a Background Check
Criminal searches can be extremely helpful in a number of different situations.  Some of the common reasons why an individual would need someone to perform a criminal background check are:

To gather information about people who are going to interact with you or the members of your family
To learn more about whether the individual has a criminal conviction
To investigate someone’s past that you are planning to date or currently dating
To look into a new person in your neighborhood
Business related ventures
And much more

Based on what you can see, a number of reasons exist as to why you might want to perform a criminal background check on an individual.  Regardless of what it is that you need to check for, you can rely on the professionals at Public Records Now to provide you with the most accurate and comprehensive information relating to someone’s past.
