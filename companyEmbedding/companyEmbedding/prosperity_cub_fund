Prosperity Cub Fund (IRSH)



Prosperity Cub Fund

Change to the Fund

RNS Number : 3238K Prosperity Cub Fund (The) 20 September 2016  

 
 
STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT
 
For Immediate Release                                                                      20 September 2016
 
 the prosperity cub fund (the "Fund")
 
Re: Change to the Fund
 
Change of Custodian
 
The Directors of the Fund wish to announce that, with effect from 20 September 2016, Deutsche Bank AG London have been terminated as custodian to the Fund and Pictet & Cie (Europe) S.A. (the "Custodian"), established and existing under the laws of Luxembourg and with its address at 15A avenue J.F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, has been appointed as Custodian to the Fund, pursuant to Custody Agreement, dated 6 September 2016, between the Fund and the Custodian (the "Custody Agreement").  
 
The Custodian is regulated by the Luxembourg financial services regulator (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier, or CSSF).
 
The Custodian receives fees for its services, comprising: (i) a minimum safekeeping fee of US$25,000 (subject to VAT) calculated quarterly in arrears on the average market value of the portfolios as at the end of the preceding three months. The safekeeping fee will be calculated on the total assets and range from 0.025% to 0.065% for assets totaling USD$3 billion or less. For assets totaling above USD$3 billion, the safekeeping fee will be subject to negotiation; (ii) a flat settlement fee charged to each transaction settled by the Custodian; and (iii) brokerage fees charged for the trading of any marketable securities. The fees are in addition to reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Custodian in the performance of its duties under the Custody Agreement, third-party brokerage commissions, stamp duties and taxes. The Fund will maintain a sufficient cash balance in the Fund's account, or accounts with the Custodian, in order to cover the Custodian's fees and expenses. 
 
The Custodian is responsible for the custody of the Fund's cash and securities. These assets will either be held by the Custodian, banks, financial institutions or certain clearing systems (such as Clearstream and Euroclear). The Custodian (or its sub Custodian) will be responsible for the safe keeping of certificates of registration or other similar certificates relating to those securities or other assets of the Fund. 
 
Under the Custody Agreement, the Custodian is authorised to carry out all operations concerning the day to day administration of the assets of the Fund. 
 
Upon receipt of a proper instruction, the Custodian is authorised to carry out the following transactions in relation to the securities:  (i) the sale of securities, (ii) the conversion of securities, (iii) exercising any right with respect to the securities, (iv) upon termination of the Custody Agreement, the transfer of securities to a succeeding Custodian, (v) debit the account of the Fund for payment of the securities and other assets purchased by the Fund, (v) arrange for income, dividends, interest and other payments to the Fund.  
 
The Custodian will segregate the Fund's securities and cash from any securities and/or cash it holds for its own account and will use its best efforts to segregate the Fund's securities and cash from securities and cash it holds otherwise on behalf of other clients. The Fund's securities that are held through the Custodian's sub-custodian in Russia, will be identified as being held on behalf of the Fund and segregated from any other securities that the sub-custodian in Russia may hold for their own account, for the account of other clients or the Custodian's own account. 
 
The Fund has agreed to indemnify the Custodian and its officers and directors from all costs, liability and expenses resulting directly or indirectly from:  (i) the Custodian acting under proper instructions under the Custody Agreement, and (ii) any act or omission of agents approved by the Fund.  The indemnity excludes costs, liability and expenses arising from the Custodian's fraud, wilful default, negligence or breach of the Custody Agreement.   
 
Sub-Custodians may be appointed by the Custodian, provided that the Custodian shall exercise reasonable skill, care and diligence in the selection and appointment of any such Sub-Custodian so as to ensure that the Sub-Custodian is a fit and proper person and has and maintains the expertise, competence and standing appropriate to discharge the responsibilities concerned, and shall be responsible to the Fund for the duration of the Sub-Custodian agreement for satisfying itself as to the on-going suitability of the Sub-Custodian to provide custodial services to the Fund.  The Custodian must maintain an appropriate level of supervision over the Sub-Custodian and make appropriate enquiries from time to time to confirm that the obligations of the Sub-Custodian continue to be adequately discharged.
 
The Custody Agreement can be terminated by either party on not less than 120 days' prior written notice.  However, if there is a breach of any provision of the Custody Agreement by either party, the other party is entitled to terminate the Custody Agreement immediately upon 30 days' prior written notice unless the breach is cured within the period.  The Custody Agreement can also be terminated by either party without notice in the event of the dissolution of either party, or if either party becomes the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, or on election of the Fund in the event of a disclosure of a conflict of interest by the Fund that adversely affects the Fund's interests. 
 
The Custody Agreement is governed by Luxembourg law.  
 
The Custodian has been appointed in addition to PJSC Citibank and JSC Halyk Finance, who are currently appointed as additional custodians to the Fund to hold assets that are located in the Ukraine and Kazakhstan, to the extent necessary.  
 
 
Cessation of the use of Cyprus Subsidiaries
 
Once the transition to the new Custodian is complete, the Fund will cease to use Cyprus Subsidiaries.
 
For various reasons that the Manager is advised the Cyprus Subsidiaries are, on balance, no longer of benefit to the Fund, the Fund in the past made a majority of its investments through Cyprus Subsidiaries.  The Cyprus Subsidiaries have now been, or are in the process of being, liquidated. 
 
 
Termination of Russian Custodian
 
As of 20 September 2016 Deutsche Bank Limited Liability Company has been terminated as Russian Custodian to the assets of the Fund.  There has been no entity re appointed in this role. The Custodian is expected to use a sub-custodian in Russia.
 
Appointment of Placement Agents to the Fund
 
Placement agents appointed by the Fund or the Manager may receive a placement fee, by way of an initial charge of up to 3% of the moneys subscribed for Participating Shares by investors placed by them.  There has been no entity appointed as Placement Agent to the Fund as of yet.

Additional Information
                            Please add any other information that you think PCML shall take in account when assessing your

                            Please note that if you elect to be treated as a Professional Client you will lose certain rights and protections attributed to Retail Clients. The rights you loose are detailed below. Please read the following text in full and indicate your agreement at the bottom of the text.

NOTICE OF TREATMENT AS AN ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE FCA’S RULES ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING

                                The purpose of this document is to advise you that under the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) we are proposing to categorize you as an Elective Professional Client, for all services, on the basis of your experience and understanding of list investment types and of the risks involved.

                                We are proposing to categorize you as an Elective Professional Client on the basis that:

                                we have undertaken an assessment of your expertise, experience and knowledge and it gives reasonable assurance, in light of the nature of the transactions or services envisaged, that you are capable of making your own investment decisions and understanding the risks involved (the “qualitative test”);
                                in relation to MiFID business in the course of that assessment, at least two of the following criteria are satisfied:
                                you have carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters;
                                the size of your financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments, exceeds €500,000;
                                you work or have worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position, which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged, (the “quantitative test”).

                                We have, on the basis of the information provided, concluded that you meet the qualitative test and that you meet parts x and x of the quantitative test.

                                Under the rules of FCA we are required to set out details of the protections that you will lose by virtue of this categorization and to seek your written consent to be categorised as an Elective Professional Client. By being categorized as an Elective Professional Client you will lose the protections of the rules which only apply to Retail Clients.

                                In particular you should note that rules relating to the following areas do not apply, or only partially apply to Elective Professional Clients:

                                Communicating with clients, including financial promotions:
                                As an Elective Professional Client the way in which we communicate with you may be different to the way in which we would communicate with a Retail Client. However, we must still ensure that our communications with you are fair, clear and not misleading.

                                Distance Communications
                                As an Elective Professional Client it is possible that you may not meet the definition of a “consumer”. If this is the case then the requirements relating to distance communications will not apply.

                                Information about firm, its services and remuneration
                                There are specific pieces of information about the firm, our services and remuneration that we must provide to Retail Clients. We are obliged to provide information on these areas to all clients but the level of detail, medium and timing of the provision is less specific for those clients that are not Retail Clients.

                                Client agreements
                                As an Elective Professional Client we are required to have a client agreement with you. However, the medium or this agreement and the timeframe within which is must be agreed are more flexible than they would have been if you were a Retail Client.

                                Suitability
                                When making personal recommendations to you we are entitled to assume that, in relation to the products, transactions and services for which you are classified as an Elective Professional Client that you have the necessary level or experience and knowledge to understand the risk involved in the transaction.
                                We are not required to provide you with a suitability report for any personal recommendations made.

                                Appropriateness
                                For transactions where we do not provide you with a personal recommendation (e.g. an execution only trade) we may be required to assess whether the transaction is appropriate for you. In these instances we are entitled to assume that, in relation to the products, transactions and services for which you are classified as an Elective Professional Client that you have the necessary level of experience and knowledge to understand the risks involved in the transaction.

                                When providing Best Execution to you as an Elective Professional Client, price is likely to be of high relative importance. However we are not obliged to determine the best possible result in terms of the total consideration, representing the price of the financial instrument and the costs related to execution, although this will be one of the factors that we will consider. Furthermore, where there is more than one competing venue to execute an order, as detailed in our Best Execution Policy, we do not have to consider our own commissions and costs relating to each of the eligible execution venues when assessing which to use in order to provide best execution. For further details please refer to our Best Execution Policy.

                                Reporting information to clients
                                When providing confirmation that we have carried out your order, the timeframe we have to do so is greater than if you were a Retail Client.

                                Finally, you should note that the services of the Financial Ombudsman Service may not be available to you as an Elective Professional Client.

                                If you agree to be categorized as an Elective Professional Client please sign and return the enclosed copy of this letter.

                                Should you have any queries in relation to this categorization please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.
I hereby certify that I understand the rights I lose by electing to be a Professional Client.
