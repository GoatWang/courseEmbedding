      Fitch Affirms 3 and Upgrades 2 Classes of Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 
      2015-A
    





November 02, 2016 12:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has taken the 
      following rating actions on Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A:
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf' with a Stable Outlook;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf' with a Stable Outlook;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf', Outlook revised to Stable 
      from Positive;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf' with a Positive Outlook;
    

      --Class D affirmed at 'BBBsf' with a Positive Outlook.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and loss 
      performance. Under the CE structure, the securities are able to 
      withstand stress scenarios consistent with the current ratings and make 
      full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Hyundai Capital America retail auto 
      loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the 
      sound financial and legal structure of the transaction. The Positive 
      Outlook on the subordinate note reflects Fitch's expectation that as 
      loss coverage levels improve, positive rating actions are likely over 
      the course of the next year.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance consistent with Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels. This increased loss coverage has 
      further reduced the sensitivity of assigned ratings to increased loss 
      levels.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not

Fitch to Rate Hyundai Auto Lease Securitization Trust 2015-B; Issues Presale | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Hyundai Auto Lease Securitization Trust 2015-B; Issues 
      Presale
    





May 28, 2015 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the asset-backed notes issued by Hyundai Auto Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2015-B:
    

      --$138,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$111,000,000 class A-2a asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$111,000,000 class A-2b asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$275,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$83,110,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,650,000 class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of recently 
      issued HALST transactions, with a WA FICO score of 741 and 8 months of 
      seasoning. The undiscounted residual value (RV) comprises 63.07% of the 
      securitization value (SV) and the pool exhibits a diversified mix of 
      vehicle models.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: Initial hard CE will be 16.95% and 13.50% for the 
      class A and B notes, respectively, growing to 18.95% and 15.50% of the 
      initial SV, consistent with 2015-A. Initial excess spread is expected to 
      be 3.56%. Loss coverage is adequate to support Fitch's 'AAAsf' and 
      'AAsf' stressed assumptions.
    

      Moderating Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on HCA's 
      portfolio have begun to increase from the low levels seen in 2010-2011, 
      but remain below peaks used to derive the base case. The increases 
      resulted from rapid origination growth and a stabilizing wholesale used 
      vehicle market. Fitch's credit loss proxy is 1.15% of the SV, and RV 
      loss proxy 13.40%.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Experienced Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes HCA to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of HCA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This 
      would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage 
      levels available to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity 
      analyses by increasing the transaction's initial base case RV and credit 
      loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of 
      issued notes. The increases to the base case losses are applied such 
      that they represent moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      transaction can be found in the reports titled ' Hyundai Auto Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2015-B -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special

      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 26, 2015.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
