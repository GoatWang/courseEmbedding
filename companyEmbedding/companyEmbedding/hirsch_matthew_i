It’s been an absolute pleasure to have Matt as my immigration attorney. He has been forthcoming, helpful, readily available and supportive providing multiple options to secure immigration. He works sincerely in the best interest of his clients. I highly recommend his services and team who are dedicated to the success of immigration matters for his clients
Erum K., February 9, 2017


















Matthew Hirsch is amazing! When my then fiancée and I went through our visa process he was incredibly helpful, always available and gave us great advice. He made the process go very fast and kept us constantly informed. We made the perfect choice. Thank you for your help Matthew!
Dimitris D., February 7, 2017


















Matt has been taking care of my immigration for over 6 years, I have been very happy with his firm and staff. Matt filed my H1b extensions and also my I-140 application. He is very professional, straight to the point, responds to emails immediately and very knowledgeable in immigration related topics which keep evolving. Also from time to time Matt has advised me in immigration related queries  not related to the case… not many provide such service/advice without a fee. I would definitely recommend Matt and would like to use his services in future as well
Sai Jagadish M., November 7, 2016


















My wife and I hired Matt to handle my Greencard application this year, and from our very first conversation, found him to be utterly reassuring and meticulous about every stage in the process…Before hiring him, we were buried in forms and deadlines and experiencing the usual immigration stress, but once Matt stepped in, we felt ahead of the game, thoroughly prepared (for our interview in particular), and reassured at all times. Matt’s team is excellent – straightforward, friendly, and genuinely helpful. Matt himself is a cheerful, patient guy who is very easy to communicate with, responsive, and above all an experienced, reassuring advocate to have in your corner. The process was a total success, and we’re delighted and relieved that I got my Green Card within a few months. I would strongly recommend Matt and his office to anyone in the Philadelphia area seeking a great lawyer with very reasonable fees to handle their immigration case.

Thanks for all your help!
Dan & Laura M, January 4, 2016


















My family and I would like to personally recommend Matthew as one of the best guys to have ever worked with relative to our immigration needs. Matthew always replied to our emails and phone calls. He never once hid behind the hold button and if he was busy, he would ALWAYS return our calls in a timely manor. My wife is now an official U.S. citizen and we owe a lot to the great help and expertise of Matthew and his staff.
Kelly R., September 8, 2016


















I’ve been working with Matthew since past 4 years on my immigration process and find him very knowledgeable, prepared and reliable. He is extremely helpful and patiently answers all my questions, anytime I contact him. He has a great work ethic, and his willingness to help is outstanding. I could not recommend anyone else in the immigration matters with the same level of confidence and trust
Hemant J, September 16, 2014


















Matthew has helped my wife, my son and myself get the Green Card in the US. He has been working with us since we moved in the US and helped us through several steps such as obtaining the TN Visa, H1B Visa and finally the Green Card. Matthew is very knowledgeable and very efficient. Every time we had a question, he would provide us with a detailed answer. I recommend Matthew for any Immigration matter without hesitation!
Pierre-Luc B, April 1, 2014


















Matthew and his team are great to work with. They never dropped the ball on my application for Green card and were always on top of things. I would definitely recommend Matthew for any immigration related questions/applications.
Rajan S., November 1, 2016


















We know Matt a decade now as he has assisted my husband in his H1B filing and also obtaining green card and citizenship. For my green card, which was a family based immigration, Matt and his team of attorneys assisted us throughout the process with honest guidance and meticulous engagement……From our first conversation with Matt, we immediately become aware of his integrity and commitment, and moreover, the passion he exudes for his work. Any concern I raised was immediately addressed. Phone calls were answered in a timely manner. Information I requested about the process was promptly forwarded. And there was never a complaint from his staff. They were always courteous and attentive, making me feel that my case was the only one being handled by the firm, when in reality I was likely one of hundreds of clients. Personally, I do not feel we could be in better hands, cannot thank them enough. We highly recommended Matthew Hirsch and his team for all your immigration needs

 

 
Nusrat S, March 11, 2014


















Our company head office contacted Matthew to assist in a company move wherein I was transferred from an overseas subsidiary to our PA based head office. I cannot overstress the professionalism evidenced when dealing with the matter of obtaining Green Cards for myself and my family. The outcome was much quicker than had been expected and a couple of issues which could have possibly caused delay were addressed and dealt with promptly. One would be hard pressed to find a more knowledgeable professional Immigration Lawyer.

Erum K., February 9, 2017


















Matthew Hirsch is amazing! When my then fiancée and I went through our visa process he was incredibly helpful, always available and gave us great advice. He made the process go very fast and kept us constantly informed. We made the perfect choice. Thank you for your help Matthew!
Dimitris D., February 7, 2017


















Matt has been taking care of my immigration for over 6 years, I have been very happy with his firm and staff. Matt filed my H1b extensions and also my I-140 application. He is very professional, straight to the point, responds to emails immediately and very knowledgeable in immigration related topics which keep evolving. Also from time to time Matt has advised me in immigration related queries  not related to the case… not many provide such service/advice without a fee. I would definitely recommend Matt and would like to use his services in future as well

The history of the United States is a history of immigration. For more than two hundred years, immigrants from the world over have come to America, enriching the nation with their cultures, languages and traditions and giving to America their labor, their innovation and their spirit.  At the Law Office of Matthew I. Hirsch, we respect our country’s legacy as a nation of immigrants. We recognize that America has been strengthened by immigration and that, from our founding to the present, immigrants have made important contributions to the cultural heritage and economic vitality of the United States.
Over the decades, America’s immigration laws have mirrored the country’s complex attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. At the Law Office of Matthew I. Hirsch, we help businesses, institutions, families and individuals to navigate today’s immigration laws and procedures. We work with diverse clients – from global corporations, to health care and technology companies, to foreign faculty and students, to athletes and artists and American families – to secure temporary and long term immigration benefits. We welcome your inquiries and look forward to serving you.
