Saturday Night Live has a new video trailer promoting Melissa McCarthy as White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, who will host the May 13th episode. I noticed the video because it was retweeted by Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice President of Environment, Policy¬†and Social Initiatives.You may wonder why an Apple senior executive is retweeting politically-charged SNL videos. It could be that she‚Äôs a huge Melissa McCarthy fan‚Äîbecause yeah‚Äîor it could be the Apple product placement at 38 seconds.Here‚Äôs the tweet and the video:This week‚Äôs host @melissamccarthy feels pretty, oh so pretty. #SNLLiveCoastToCoast pic.twitter.com/dvh4ZmXPmc‚Äî Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) May 10, 2017Is This Apple‚Äôs SNL Ad?You may remember that SNL is producing an ad for Apple. It‚Äôs clearly product placement, but this isn‚Äôt the ad, per se. But it is almost certainly a teaser for that ad, which was announced in April as in-show content paid for by Apple. Consider the tweet part of the package.Melissa McCarthy has had a huge hit with her Sean Spicer impression. If it‚Äôs no coincidence Apple Watch is featured so specifically, it could be a play on Mr. Spicer‚Äôs social media-captured trip to an Apple Store to buy an Apple Watch.I don‚Äôt feel too strongly about that angle because that story involved someone asking him what it‚Äôs like to work for a fascist. That doesn‚Äôt seem the sort of thing Apple would want to step into, but who knows where the skit will go?Lastly, I love this trailer and can‚Äôt wait to see the full skit.

After a wildly successful debut, Melissa McCarthy was back as White House Press Secretary for the second straight week - this time wearing items from Ivanka Trump's line during Saturday Night Live's cold open on NBC.McCarthy poked fun at Spicer's testy back-and-forth exchanges with the press corps and complained of 'light terrorism at Nordstrom' - a reference to the retailer's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's clothing line.'First of all I‚Äôd just like to announce that I‚Äôm calm now and I will remain calm as long you sons of b****,' the faux Spicer said before gathering himself.'I‚Äôm not gonna do that because that‚Äôs the old Spicey and this is the new Spicey and I‚Äôve been told to cut back on the gum-chewing so I‚Äôm now limiting myself to one slice a day,' Spicer says as he holds up a large block of bubble gum.

McCarthy poked fun at Spicer, mispronouncing the names of foreign countries and leaders.When he struggles to utter the name of the wife of a central Asian leader, an exasperated Spicer says: 'I'm¬†just gonna pass on that one. Let‚Äôs just call her Connie.'    





 This time, Spicer was sporting items supposedly from Ivanka Trump's line during Saturday Night Live's cold open on NBC  





 Spicer complained about 'light terrorism at Nordstrom's' and urged the White House press corps to buy Ivanka Trump-brand bracelets  





 Spicer also shows off shoes supposedly from Ivanka's line. The spoof of the White House press secretary poked fun at Kellyanne Conway's comments this week urging people to buy Ivanka Trump products  





 The SNL cold open featured a graphic with the price similar to those seen on television shopping channels'Now I‚Äôm gonna open it up for questions, and I‚Äôm probably gonna freak if you ask stupid ones.'Spicer calls on New York Times correspondent¬†Glenn Thrush.When 'Thrush' asks about the Trump's administration's response to a federal court striking down its travel ban, an aggravated Spicer looks up at the sky and says: 'You're testing me, big guy.'¬†  





 McCarthy revives her portrayal of Spicer as a belligerent press secretary who is combative with reporters  





 Spicer's propensity to chew gum is also exaggerated in the SNL McCarthy skit  





 'Now I‚Äôm gonna open it up for questions, and I‚Äôm probably gonna freak if you ask stupid ones,' Spicer tells reporters after he finishes his gum'Spicer' also joked that the Trump administration would take its case to the People's Court.'That isn‚Äôt real,' Thrush replies.'It is real,' Spicer says. 'The cases are real. The rulings are final. Don‚Äôt "f" with me, Glenn. Next question. This turkey.'¬†Spicer was then asked about the administration's plan for 'extreme vetting.''It means it‚Äôs extreme,' Spicer says. 'You know what? Spicey‚Äôs gonna explain it so you dumb babies can understand it.'  





 'It means it‚Äôs extreme,' Spicer says. 'You know what? Spicey‚Äôs gonna explain it so you dumb babies can understand it'  





 Spicer then uses his famous props - taking out a Barbie doll and another doll with darker skin  





 'This is a nice American girl back from a dream vacation,' Spicer says of Barbie. 'We know she‚Äôs okay because she‚Äôs blonde, so she gets in'  





 'We‚Äôre gonna pat her down, read her emails, and if we don‚Äôt like her answers, which she won‚Äôt ‚Äì BOOM ‚Äì Guantanamo Bay'Spicer then uses his famous props - taking out a Barbie doll and another doll with darker skin.¬†He then takes out a male doll meant to represent a 'TSA agent' who inspects the dolls.'This is a nice American girl back from a dream vacation,' Spicer says of Barbie. 'We know she‚Äôs okay because she‚Äôs blonde, so she gets in.''Who‚Äôs ¬†up next? It‚Äôs Moana,' Spicer says, referring to the dark-skinned doll.¬†'We‚Äôre gonna pat her down, read her emails, and if we don‚Äôt like her answers, which she won‚Äôt ‚Äì BOOM ‚Äì Guantanamo Bay.'¬†  





 The cold open also featured a cameo by 'Attorney General Jeff Sessions,' played by Kate McKinnon (above)Spicer was then asked about 'a terrorist attack in Atlanta' - even though there wasn't a terrorist attack there.'I said that wrong when I said it, then you wrote it, which makes you wrong,' Spicer tells a reporter.'That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here. Obviously I meant Orlanta.'¬†¬†When asked if he meant Orlando, Spicer replied: 'Look, the problem is all these terrorist incidences you‚Äôre not reporting on.'I have a whole list of things you never even write about.'¬†Spicer proceeds to mention fictitious events like 'the Bowling Green massacre' as well as 'the slaughter at Fraggle Rock' and 'the night they drove old Dixie down.'¬†¬†'Then there was 'light terrorism when Nordstrom decided to stop selling Ivanka‚Äôs line of clothing and accessories, and that‚Äôs Nordstrom‚Äôs loss,' Spicer said.'These are high-quality products.'At this point, Spicer begins to show off some  products he says are from Ivanka's line.  





 When another reporter asks if Spicer was 'mentally okay,' Spicer rams the reporters over with a Segway affixed to the podium  





 'You don't have a chance against Spicey,' the rampaging press secretary says  





 Last week, 'Spicer' on the SNL skit used his podium to ram into a reporter whose question he did not like'I‚Äôm wearing one of her bangles right now,' Spicer says.The screen then displays graphics similar to those seen on television shopping networks - with the price of the product, an 800-number, and promises of a 'money back guarantee.'¬†'Don‚Äôt even get me started on her shoes, because these babies are real head-turners.'Spicer then pulls up his leg and shows off his heeled shoes.After McKinnon's appearance as Sessions, Spicer then fields a question about Chicago.'As you know we do need someone who‚Äôs gonna bring back law and order,' Sessions said.¬†'The murder rate is over 80 per cent in Chicago. 80 per cent of the people in Chicago have been murdered.'When a reporter played by Cecily Strong says that data contradicts Spicer's claim, the press secretary takes out an air blower and blows air up her skirt.'That was me blowing away their dishonesty,' Spicer says.When another reporter asks if Spicer was 'mentally okay,' Spicer rams the reporters over with a Segway affixed to the podium.¬†'You don't have a chance against Spicey,' he says.¬†

Melissa McCarthy Nails Amazing Sean Spicer Impression in Explosive, Hilarious 'SNL' Sketch

                    by Zach Seemayer
                     1:03 AM PST, February 05, 2017                












































 Playing
                                            Melissa McCarthy Nails Amazing Sean Spicer Impression in Explosive, Hilarious 'SNL' Sketch                                        





Saturday Night Live continues to assemble an A-list dream team of guest stars to lampoon President Donald Trump and his administration with a surprise appearance by Melissa McCarthy as White House press secretary Sean Spicer.                                        















                                            Donning an oversized suit and short-cropped wig, the Ghostbusters star delivered an amazing impression of the hot-tempered Spicer in what might have been the breakout sketch of the night.                                        




                                            From the press secretary's infamously contentious relationship with members of the press to his use of "alternative facts," and even his bizarre affinity for chewing gum, McCarthy's impersonation was as brutal as it was hilarious.                                        

                                            "Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start," McCarthy's Spicer said at a half-yell over the uproarious cheers from the SNL audience. "And when I say 'rocky start,' I mean in the sense of Rocky, the movie. Because I came out her to punch you in the face. And also, I don't talk so good."                                        

  

                                            As the press conference went on, McCarthy's Spicer got increasingly more agitated at the reporters ‚Äì played by SNL castmembers and host Kristen Stewart ‚Äì who had the audacity to ask questions about Trump's recent immigration ban,  Steve Bannon's placement on the National Security Council and the appointment of Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education.                                        

                                            As a way of lashing out, Spicer swore, hit reporters with the podium and even had a CNN reporter locked in a cage in the corner wearing a diaper.                                        

                                            McCarthy's explosive, powerhouse comedic performance was met with rave reviews on Twitter, with many praising her spot-on delivery and commanding presence.
