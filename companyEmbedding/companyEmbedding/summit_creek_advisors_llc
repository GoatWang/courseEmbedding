Summit Creek Advisors, LLC - Philosophy and Process


























Summit Creek Advisors' investment philosophy is founded on the importance of fundamental research.  We are bottom up stock pickers with the decision makers as close as possible to the flow of information - communicating directly with company management, analysts and other sources.  We believe that our direct company research is the driving force behind our investment results.  Historically, relative outperformance has been achieved through security selection not sector allocation. Summit Creek Advisors believes that investing in high quality companies with consistent and sustainable growth provides the best opportunity for achieving superior portfolio returns over the long-term.  We initially search for companies with a proven growth track record, low financial leverage,  high return on equity, strong cash flow, and significant management ownership.  Through detailed internal research, we identify companies with consistent growth characteristics that appear to be sustainable for a multi-year period.  Valuation is also a very important part of our process in determining when to purchase new ideas, and how to weight holdings in the portfolio.  Over time, this focus on high quality companies and valuation has resulted in strong downside protection. We continue to perform ongoing rigorous research once a stock is in the portfolio.  This includes constructing an earnings model on each company to enhance our understanding of the business and sensitivity of company earnings to changing growth or margin assumptions.  In addition, frequent discussions with company management teams, analysts and other sources are of critical importance to effectively value the securities in our portfolio, while also helping us to assess continued fit and sustainable growth. The result of our investment process is a concentrated small cap growth portfolio.  The focus on consistent and sustainable growth has historically resulted in a portfolio heavily weighted in the traditional growth sectors of consumer, health care and technology.  Our long-term performance has been driven by bottom-up security selection, a focus on valuation, and the ability to assess a company's sustainable growth fit.
