Nader Pourhassan
Thank you, Mike. Greetings, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In today's call we would like to go over our 2017 outlook and specifically important milestones for the next three months. Before getting into this, I must say, I am proud of our many accomplishments that now have CytoDyn in the strongest position in our corporate history.
Specifically, we overcame many difficult obstacles and undertook many tough challenges, and here we are, two Phase 3 clinical trials and the potential to submit a BLA, Biologic Licensing Agreement for final approval in this year 2017. As you know, we have a clear regulatory path for U.S. approval of PRO 140 for treating HIV patients.
Important milestones for 2017 for our HIV program are: we got to our Phase 3 pivotal trial, now this is the trial we will use to get our first approval for PRO 140. We are on track to reach a major clinical and business inflection point by the end of March by reporting efficacy results from our pivotal Phase 3 trial with PRO 140 as a combination therapy.
In regards to our second Phase 3 monotherapy trial, this is a trial we hope to use to obtain second approval for PRO 140 as a single agent therapy. We are encouraged by interest from physicians, clinicians and patients alike in our Phase 3 clinical trial with PRO 140 as the monotherapy and anticipate rapid enrollment in this trial.

In this regard, we have recorded breathtaking testimonies in the form of interview of nine patients who have had over two years of PRO 140 monotherapy and claim that their quality of life has been significantly improved and they all say that it is due to PRO 140 having no significant toxicity or side effects.
In regards to our non-HIV indication, we expect to treat the first patient in our Phase 2 trial with PRO 140 in Graft versus Host Disease or GvHD. And last but not least is our new development in evaluating PRO 140 for autoimmune diseases and cancer in animal models.
We are encouraged with the results we have seen thus far and planned to submit the results for publication this quarter. We have come a very long way over the past four years and our resumes speaks for itself which indicate our strength by taking PRO 140 through FDA approval process.
So, briefly, from 2012 to 2016, this is what we accomplished. In 2012 we successfully acquired all the rights to PRO 140 from Progenics. In 2013 we put together a world-class team to develop PRO 140. In 2014 we defined a new path for PRO 140, a path completely different than Progenics top scientists and innovators. In 2015 we initiated our first pivotal Phase 3 trial for Pro 140 for HIV infection in combination therapy. In 2016 our long-term monotherapy trial results continue to be very impressive and we not only continued with our pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy trial, but injected the first patient in our highly anticipated Phase 3 monotherapy, our second Phase 3 study.
So allow me to now tell you what we think we will be doing in 2017. Number one, in regards to our pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy, I believe all eyes will be on the number of patients we have enrolled. So let me update you in this regard.
As of today, we have enrolled 12 patients and need 18 more to complete enrollment. That said, I am pleased to report that we also have additional 13 patients who are now in the screening process. The total number of sites and hospitals that are actively enrolling for us in this study is currently 38. This gives us confidence in our ability to enroll the 18 additional patients needed to reach the 30-patient mark, and importantly, to report our primary efficacy endpoint results before the end of March.
You recall back in January 22, 2016, CytoDyn had applied breakthrough designation for this population. However, the FDA indicated that CytoDyn does not have data in this population and at that time we did not. Currently, we have seven patients that have finished the 25-week trial and total of 12 patients have been enrolled. Our regulatory team indicated that only five patient’s data could be enough and we have 12 so far. I am hopeful that we can receive breakthrough designation utilizing this data in this quarter. We are planning to submit this data to the FDA.
Furthermore, we previously announced the finding of Orphan Drug designation with PRO 140 as a combination therapy in this patient population and expect to receive a determination from the FDA during this quarter. This designation has several advantages including multiple years of commercial exclusivity.
We are often asked about the importance of the Phase 3 combination trial when many HIV-infected patients achieve suppressed viral load with HAART alone, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy.
Why add another therapy? The answer in the case of addition of PRO 140 is because HAART, which is a combination of three or more drugs in pill form can have high level of toxicity with side effects and the pills must be taken at a specific time each day to avoid resistance. This can lead to serious quality of life and compliance issues, and resistance to four to five classes of drugs is dangerous.

So we believe that HIV patients who are on combination HAART and PRO 140 can eliminate the most toxic drug in their HAART regimen and may even be able to miss taking their pills for several days with no repercussion to their health. Therefore, we believe these reasons provide a very strong and compelling advantage for combined therapy, and support an annual U.S. market that we estimate at $1 billion.
So this concludes all of our updates about our pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy and now I would like to give you update on our other Phase 3 trial, our monotherapy investigative trial. So update number two, we are delighted to have this trial underway and the first patient injected after receiving clearance from the FDA in December.
We are enrolling 300 HIV patients with R5 strain or maintaining the viral load with HAART. The trial is being conducted under almost the same criteria as our previous Phase 2 monotherapy trial with patients receiving weekly subcutaneous injection of PRO 140, with the trial period extended from 12 weeks to 48 weeks.
Due to the Christmas holiday patient enrollment came to near standstill shortly after we open enrollment. As a result of this, currently, enrollment stands at only seven patients. That said, I am pleased to report that about 35 more patients have been screened and could begin treatment with PRO 140 soon. This will be a rapid enrollment pace that we anticipate for the monotherapy trial.
Now I must discuss an interesting and potentially very positive new development pertaining to the non-responders to PRO 140 by some patients with R5 strain in our Phase 2 monotherapy trial that could have implication for our Phase 3 monotherapy trial. So just to remind you, some patient did not respond more than few weeks to monotherapy in our previous Phase 2b trial, while others did, and as you know some are now have passed two years of treatment.
At the FDA’s suggestion we reviewed published data indicating that HIV patients can have widely varying density of CCR5 under cell surface. According to this data that number could exceed the previous acknowledged level of CCR5 by factor exceeding 100 folds.
What does this mean? Well, as we all know, PRO 140 works by blocking the CCR5 receptor that allows HIV to infect cells. This means that those patients who didn't respond to PRO 140 in Phase 2 monotherapy trial might have had a high density of CCR5, which means they could have had more CCR5 under surface of their cell than others, which could indicate that they needed more PRO 140 than others.
We know that only 21 of 39 of the original enrolled patient completed 12-week monotherapy trial. Among the 18 non-responders, eight were treated for infection, which is a non-response issue that could be independent of PRO 140. By excluding these patients 21 of 31 patients or about 70% were responders.
So to put this in a simple language, the lack of response to PRO 140 monotherapy by the other 10 patients in the trial may have been due to an insufficient dose of PRO 140 to address the high CCR5 density. This is encouraging as it may provide insights into why some patients with R5 strain responded, while others did not, like this is not the case.
From our 300 patients monotherapy Phase 3 trial, we should at least get a number of responded that would be statistically more significant than previous 39 patients trial. Now this we believe is important to seek second approval for monotherapy for PRO 140 after we hopefully get our first approval for combination therapy.
Okay, let me now update you in regards to a third item, which is our GvHD Phase 2 trial, Graft versus Host Disease trial. As I mentioned earlier, the first patient is expected to be treated later this year. Furthermore, you might recall that we had submitted application for Orphan Drug designation for PRO 140 in GvHD and the FDA has requested additional animal data. This month we expect to have what we believe is the required data. If this data is positive, we will submit this data for the FDA -- to the FDA in support of Orphan Drug designation.

This brings me to our very important next update. We are excited about the many applications of PRO 140 due to its novel mechanism of action. I am delighted to share that we have very positive animal data in a colon cancer model and the model for multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disease. These results have been slated for publication in the pre-review journal during the current quarter. Given the strength of our results, we will continue to seek opportunities to secure a partner for further development of PRO 140 for these non-HIV indications.
Turning now to corporate development update number five. We entered 2017 with the strengthened balance sheet, having raised $13 million late last year in support of advancing the development of PRO 140. We are proud to have raised more than $32 million in all of 2016 and more than 70 million since I became CEO in 2012. Obviously, under my leadership we never failed to deliver on this important task.
In regards to CytoDyn’s visibility, we are also actively creating greater visibility for CytoDyn and awareness of PRO 140 within the HIV and investment communities by teaming up Public Relations, Investor Relations and Media Relations start. Next week we will be holding meetings with investment professions at J.P. Morgan Conference in San Francisco and we are planning to have multiple road shows in a regular basis all of this current quarter.
And finally, we have fulfilled FDA request by meeting with HIV community advocates to get their input on our studies. We held a six-hour meeting with six activists in December in Vancouver, Washington, where our corporate headquarters are located.
During this meeting we shared data, discussed clinical trial design and implementation of three clinical trial and their extensions. We were pleased with the participants, meaningful input and feedback and their suggestions on study enroll and participant education.
We plan the second community meeting in Seattle in late February following our presentation at CROI and this brings us to our upcoming CROI 2 presentations. You may recall our announcement last August that 10 patients in our Phase 2b monotherapy extension study were approaching two years of suppressed viral loads with weekly subcutaneous self injection of PRO 140.
In November we announced that data from this trial had been selected for presentation in a posters session and that we were among the very few designated to be featured during a special themed discussion. This themed discussion will be held in February 16 and will include a panel of representatives from Gilead, Merck and NIH, all major key players in HIV therapy.
Dr. Paul Maddon, the inventor of PRO 140 and senior science advisor to CytoDyn was originally assigned to participate on the panel on our behalf. Please make sure you understand that it is an immense honor to be chosen for this session, which promises to attract attention from top key opinion leaders in our field, as well as many major media.
As a recap, we are off to a very strong start to 2017 and have the following expectations. Completing enrollment in our Phase 3 PRO 140 combination trial and reporting primary endpoint efficacy results by the end of the first quarter, file the missing data for our breakthrough designation for combination trial, receiving notice from the FDA on Orphan Drug designation for PRO 140 in treatment experienced HIV patients, advancing recruitment in our Phase 3 monotherapy trial, presenting Phase 2b monotherapy result at CROI on February 15 and 16, and participating in a themed session along with elite companies, injecting the first patient in the Phase 2 GvHD trial, submitting animal data in support of Orphan Drug designation for GvHD, announcing the publication of new data that further validate the effectiveness of PRO 140 in autoimmune diseases and cancer, and submitting all three components of BLA to support accelerated approval process for PRO 140 first FDA approval, BLA being Biologic License Application.

My dear shareholders, we have come a very long way since making our $3.5 million upfront payment for PRO 140. We expect an eventful and exciting year ahead that brings us significantly closer to gaining approval for PRO 140. Importantly, we are advancing the development of this novel therapeutic to bring new treatment options to those with HIV and hopefully other undeserved disease -- diseases and conditions.
With those remarks, operator, please open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Yi Chen of Rodman & Renshaw. Please state your question.
Yi Chen
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is, I guess, it is and still remains the same that you need the safety data from the maintenance therapy to support the BLA you are filing of the PRO 140 for as a combination therapy? So my question is that have you get any idea from the FDA, how many patients’ data you need from the maintenance therapy as a support material for the combinations therapy, when you will get that idea, will it be after you report efficacy data from the combination therapy? 
Nader Pourhassan
Sorry, can you hear me now.
Yi Chen
Yes.
Nader Pourhassan
Can you hear me?
Yi Chen
Yes. I can hear you.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah.
Yi Chen
Yes.
Nader Pourhassan
Sorry about that. So as I was saying we expect to get that data from our monotherapy Phase 3 trial. And the FDA has indicated that we should go and meet back -- and meet with them as soon as we have our 30th patient in combination therapy had one week and bring whatever information we have from -- whatever number of patients we have from monotherapy.
Yi Chen
Okay. –Just from the Phase 3 monotherapy alone, do you expect to reach the halfway enrollment that is 150 patients maybe by the end of this year?
Nader Pourhassan
So by the end of this year I expect to have every one of those 300 patients enrolled.
Yi Chen
Okay.
Nader Pourhassan
That’s my expectation. Let me just explain that in Phase 2b trial we close the first cohort of the patient in two weeks. I currently get emails after emails from patients saying that we want to get in the monotherapy. We are hearing that this is a great treatment and therefore we believe that it’s going to be a very, very fast pace enrollment.
Yi Chen
Okay. Thank you. And currently what you just said about why -- the reason that some of the CCR5 patients did not response to PRO 140 is because of the dosing of PRO 140 was not sufficient. So what kind of increased dosing we expect to see for going forward?
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Very good question. So the half life of this product is 3.5 days, 3.4 days I should say. So in our protocol we have the option available to us to change the injection from every seven days to every four days. So if any patient start having a peak in their viral load of -- even let say 100 or anything more than target not detectable which is less than 40 copies per meal we will definitely switch them to every four days and hopefully that would give them enough PRO 140 to be able to respond.
Yi Chen
Got it. Thank you.
Nader Pourhassan
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Robert Detcher [ph] of Paulson Investment Company. Please state your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my call and thank you Nader for all the progress that you're making. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. One is what is the cost of the HAART treatment for the average patient, what’s the average cost for that and what you anticipate the cost would be once you get approval for PRO 140, and how did they compare?
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Thank you for your question. That’s a very good question. So cost of HAART is depends on which pills you take. But in average the one pill a day like, Atripla, Complera, QUAD1, QUAD2, so forth, they are about $36,000 per year, that’s the cost to the patient. So we -- the price that we will set for PRO 140 is all going to be dependent on many -- it depends on many factors, but I can assure you that the cost of our product just to be manufactured is way, way less than that and definitely would be very profitable if we were going to go with only exact same price as one pill a day and one pill a day we have tremendous amount of advantages to that in our opinion.

Unidentified Analyst
But are -- can you still hear me.
Nader Pourhassan
I still do, go ahead?
Unidentified Analyst
Aren’t most patients taking multiple - most HAART – aren’t they taking multiple pills?
Nader Pourhassan
So the one pill a day has three components where the patient can just take one pill a day. But if they get resistance they then be on the second line therapy and third line and so forth, and usually then they increase it to three pills a day and then four and five, some patient in our Phase 2b monotherapy was -- were on six pills a day, they put all of it away and enjoyed and hardly any toxicity and hardly any side effect therapy PRO 140.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And what kind of financial assistance do people get with the HAART treatment and what kind of financial assistance will they get, would it be the similar or what is available to patients?
Nader Pourhassan
Well, the insurance that right now covers HAART, I will think that they would be very, very happy to see that there is a product that doesn't require patients to have all kind of problems with their liver and kidneys. And as long as you have FDA approval for your product and the product works for that indication we will be just competing with other products and same rules.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, can you give us some idea what the relative cost, you said your cost of manufacture is going to be substantially less? Could you give us some relative idea?
Nader Pourhassan
Yes. It could be as low as $3000 to $4000 per year treatment and that’s giving a patient two injections a week, which is two vials for us to provide for them.
Unidentified Analyst
And that would be your costs to the company? What would you anticipate patient might have to pay?
Nader Pourhassan
Well, then you got a lot of other costs besides just manufacturing. Now then you got -- the finance people have to get involved and that is going to be very difficult for me to elaborate on at this time.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And another question about the monotherapy, the 300 patients? How long do you think that’s going, how long -- you said something about 12 to 48 weeks or could you elaborate a little bit on when you think you’ll have the 300 patients and how long that trial will go?
Nader Pourhassan
So the trial is a 48-week trial. We were saying that this trial is very similar to our other trial that we just conducted, but that other trial Phase 2b was only a 12-week trial, this one is 48-week trial. So we believe that we will be able to enroll all those 300 patients this year for sure. That's what we believe.
Unidentified Analyst
And it will last -- the trial will last 48 weeks?
Nader Pourhassan
So each patient will be in this trial for 48 weeks.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Okay. But if I may ask you one more [indiscernible], I've discussed this with other, I mean, investor of course, I didn’t discuss it with you. You mentioned that you're going to be on a panel that’s going to include Gilead and Merck?
Nader Pourhassan
Correct. So we are selected to be on a themed discussion is on CROI website, actually you could access it and other companies include Merck and Gilead and NIH.
Unidentified Analyst
And NIH and when is that, in February did you say?
Nader Pourhassan
February 16 is our themed discussion. February 15 is our poster session.
Unidentified Analyst
And when -- where is it?
Nader Pourhassan
Seattle.
Unidentified Analyst
In Seattle, and because the question I'm often asked is where -- why have you not been approached by companies like Gilead -- especially Gilead or some of the other companies with all the positive results you had or perhaps you have been approached, I don’t know and I don’t know what you are -- what you can say?
Nader Pourhassan
So, yeah, the big pharmers they look at your trials and our first approval trial is combination. Combination therapy is among very difficult patients and according to our number there is about 20,000 to 25,000 patients that have three drug resistance, which then they would be qualified for this product, which is one drug resistance to three different classes. So they are looking at this as a small population. We need to show that our product is way different than other products because of the side effect and toxicity that is completely different profile and we need to show the advantages of our product, and perhaps, once we prove ourselves than people's mind might change, but I cannot talk about who we’ll talk into at this time and I have to go with the next question at this time. Thank you for your questions.

Unidentified Analyst
Thank you very much.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt McKieska [ph], a Private Investor. Please state your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, Nader. Thanks guys for the updates. I really appreciate it.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst
And my question is kind of simple it’s -- what’s the situation with having to raise capital to keep going with this stuff? Are we going to be start giving data results before we have to raise capital or vice versa?
Nader Pourhassan
So I am going to prefer that to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike.
Michael Mulholland
Yes. Let me briefly summarize our cash position. We reported the -- at the end of August that we had about $4.4 million of cash on hand. Since then we reported raises of $9 million net in mid-September and the $3 million net in mid-December. We've also reported in the last -- in most recent filings that our monthly cash requirements are approximately $2 million a month. And you'll -- I really can't do the math for you, we will be updating our cash position, as well as updating our forward-looking estimates for trial costs in our next 10-Q, which will be filed approximately in the next 10 days or so for the November 30th quarter. But if one were to do the math it clearly would indicate that as we have said all along, we will need additional capital in the future if all of these trials are to run to their conclusion. Nader?
Nader Pourhassan
Thank you, Mike. Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Art Saden [ph], a Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello, sir. Thank you for very informal presentation.
Nader Pourhassan
Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst
I have a follow up to the last question, which is what are the possibilities of raising non-dilutive capital such as from the National Health Service, CDC, DOD, philanthropic the activity is because as you know HIV/AIDS is one of the most well-funded philanthropic medical areas in the world and this is the science and why we have stayed with the company so long is because we believe in the science and the medicine and the hope for humanity in United States and around the world. But as you know the stock market is an emprise indicator of the company’s real worth but the last two raises had very detrimental effect on the stock price coming at by more than half from the top where it sits now. So have you explored non-dilutive financing from any foundation, agency, governmental body or anybody?
Nader Pourhassan
So thank you for your question. In past we had been beneficiary of $28 -- almost $28 million worth of grant from NIH. Progenics used those grant and the pace that they were going forward was really very, very slow. We definitely welcome any opportunities, but we believe it is to our best of our shareholder and our future of our stock to get these products immediately to primary endpoint and hopefully to approval. That would be very valuable to everybody and if we were going to spend few years to raise money from these places or not raise money to receive grants from them, I think that would be very time consuming and the fact that we had that experienced before, because we just need to go as fast as we can.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And I am very familiar with the process and you are exactly right, it’s very bureaucratic, very time consuming and very slow. The problem is if, well, without violating any safe harbor, insider or information, et cetera, if there is private financing and the stock price just cut in half again when we all have to wait to the glory day when it stood up to $10 a share or $5 a share or you get joint venture to take over, but are you -- do you have concern at all about the shareholders, investors which we have all seen cut by more than half right…

Nader Pourhassan
So that…
Unidentified Analyst
… in the way…
Nader Pourhassan
… concern to have and let me address what I think. When we have breakthrough designation opportunity and two Orphan Drug designation opportunities, and what we called coming out, perhaps, partly for us in CROI, bidding at to the among elite companies and our science has made progress, but we have to overcome many obstacles. But make no mistake please that we are not in the same position as we were before. We are a very strong company when it comes to our science and our progress with FDA.
And to be able to do what we have done. We has little as money as we have used and with the speed that we have got to this point, it makes me feel very strong and I believe this quarter would be a golden quarter in my opinion, that's just my opinion and I think we have shown in the last four years what we were capable of doing, taking this product and changing it completely around, what many scientist and innovators at Progenics were not able to do.
So I think we have proven ourselves and the future we have set it up very beautifully and I think everybody will be very excited in 2017, because I believe if everything goes the way we are planning, we have plenty of things to celebrate.
Unidentified Analyst
Let us pray.
Nader Pourhassan
Thank you. Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Dean Richard [ph], a Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Hello. I just have a quick question regarding P3 combo. I know we only have 12 enrolled and your anticipation as we can get the other 18 enrolled in Q1 along with primary efficacy point, which is the one we follow-up? Why are you so optimistic about getting 18 when it’s taken so long to get the first 12 of that in all respectfully? Thank you.
Nader Pourhassan
No. Very good question actually. Thank you. When we first started this trial we immediately stopped our processes as we were enrolling hospitals and then back to FDA and asked instead of having three drug resistance let us have two drug resistance, that process when you send a letter it takes 30 days waiting and then you get it and you have to train all the sites again. Then we went back to FDA say let us have one drug resistance and when you go through all of these processes it took us about a year, doing all of these and as we got where we need to get, which is reduce number, during this one year we enrolled 38 sites and hospitals.
Now if you check with any institute or any CRO, enrolling hospital, two or three per month or maybe four or five per month is a lot. So we were working on getting the hospital situated and now they are very excited and they are able to find the patient. And the fact that we have 13 patients in the screening and these 38 hospitals just need to give us one patient per hospital and that’s 38, not counting the 13 in the screening.
We talked to our senior clinical person and he is very optimistic that we can have this. Obviously, we are not saying that this is 100%. We need to see how it folds out. But it’s very positive and we went through Thanksgiving and Christmas and we still enrolled. So I think these numbers are very exciting and we are going to be able to have our primary endpoint first quarter as we have said before.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you very much. And follow up real quick is you are saying the BLA submission could be as early as -- early part of Q2, if we do get this primary efficacy follow up from the 30 patients, what is your feelings and the strength of the BLA going in discussion with the FDA? Thank you.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Very good question again. Yes, with Biologic License Application, we believe if we get breakthrough designation our CMC package could be prepared faster. There could be other advantages. FDA has told us to enroll all 30 patients and come back and let’s talk about the BLA. So having a breakthrough designation and going back would be very big plus for us. We would report as things come up. Next question?

Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jared Cohen of JM Cohen & Co.
Jared Cohen
Yeah. Just in terms of going back to funding, because given all the signs that you have at this point, it seems logical that you should be able to get a partner at this point to help fund you at this point in terms of get some type of upfront payment and then after that royalty stream, if you did it in a way for one of your trials or indications to help fund the company. Have you looked into that?
Nader Pourhassan
So we are open to any one of those opportunities and we cannot talk obviously about, if we are talking to anybody on that those things. But obviously if there is anything comes up we definitely would let everybody know and if we are in discussions, currently we just can’t talk about those things.
Jared Cohen
All right. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Richard Butcher of Argonne Capital.
Nader Pourhassan
Richard?
Richard Butcher
Hi, Nader.
Nader Pourhassan
Hi, Richard.
Richard Butcher
Hey. How are you doing?
Nader Pourhassan
Very good. Thank you.
Richard Butcher
Yeah. All right. So I kind of have a two part question here, first, how does the CROI Conference compared to the ASM Microbe Conference that was involved in? And then secondly, you might have mentioned this earlier, but just for the benefit of all the shareholders, what did you think the market was for the monotherapy for PRO 140?
Nader Pourhassan
Sure. So the market for monotherapy we believe is $11 billion. Now that's according to where we did a lot of the calculation and that was the final number we came up with and it’s now on our website.
Richard Butcher
Great. Thank you.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. And in regards to your other question comparing CROI with ASM. We thought that ASM is going to be much bigger than what it was, because they were joining with [ph] ICAG (45:28) and that was a first year they did that. But, obviously, we didn’t think it was anywhere close to what CROI is and has been all through these years.
Richard Butcher
Great. And then the significance of the CROI, I mean, how do you expect that presentation to go, I mean, especially since you will be with some of the larger players, Gilead and Merck?
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Definitely, so we talked to major key opinion leaders and the inventor Dr. Paul Maddon. He reviewed the other presentations and he said to me that your abstract is the most exciting by far, the themed discussion has to have something that’s new. We are the only company that have done monotherapy with the results of two years, obviously, PRO 140 works and we just got to get an approval and having results of 10 patients going past two years and getting interviews from them and they all indicate that for many years they were not able to hold the job, they were not able to do any kind of good activities that they wanted to do and they said that they got their life back, that’s -- that was the statement we received from them. So we believe that CROI is a very important conference for us because it's a biggest conference for HIV in the world.
Richard Butcher
Great. Thank you very much. Have good quarters and best of luck.
Nader Pourhassan
Yeah. Thank you so much, Richard. I appreciate your question. Next please?
Operator
There are no further questions at the time.
Nader Pourhassan
Okay. So thank you everybody for being on this call, and as I said, we will look forward to very prosperous 2017 and Happy New Year to everybody. Thank you.

Job Details
               CytoDyn is a biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of humanized monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. The Company has one of the leading monoclonal antibodies under development for HIV infection, PRO 140, which has completed Phase 2 clinical trials with demonstrated antiviral activity in man and is currently in Phase 3. PRO 140 blocks the HIV co-receptor CCR5 on T cells, which prevents viral entry. Clinical trial results thus far indicate that PRO 140 does not negatively affect the normal immune functions that are mediated by CCR5. Results from seven Phase 1 and Phase 2 human clinical trials have shown that PRO 140 can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV. A recent Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that PRO 140 can prevent viral escape in patients during several weeks of interruption from conventional drug therapy. CytoDyn intends to continue to develop PRO 140 as a therapeutic anti-viral agent in persons infected with HIV and to pursue non-HIV indications where CCR5 and its ligand CCL5 may be involved.

148 F.Supp.2d 1185 (2001)


UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff,
v.
Nader Z. POURHASSAN, Defendant.


United States District Court, D. Utah, Central Division.
April 6, 2001.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
 James C. Bradshaw, Brown, Bradshaw Anderson & Moffat LLP, Salt Lake City, UT, for Defendant.
Christopher B. Chaney, U.S. Attorney's Office, American Fork, UT, for Plaintiff.





ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT
J. THOMAS GREENE, District Judge.
This matter is before the court on defendant Nader Z. Pourhassan's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute upon which his indictment is based is void for vagueness. The court heard extensive oral argument on this motion  and took it under advisement.1 The United States was represented by Assistant United States Attorney Felice John Viti and Pourhassan was represented by James Bradshaw of Brown Bradshaw Anderson & Moffat.
Now, being fully advised, the court enters the following Order.
I. CRIMINAL MISREPRESENTATION OF PRODUCTS AS INDIAN PRODUCED OR OF INDIAN ORIGIN UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 1159
The government has charged Pourhassan with two counts of criminal misrepresentation of Indian produced goods and products in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1159. 18 U.S.C. § 1159 makes it a criminal offense to "offer or display for sale or sell any good ... in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States." 18 U.S.C. § 1159(a).2 As used in the statute, an "Indian" is a "member of an Indian tribe" or "certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian tribe." 18 U.S.C. § 1159(c)(1); 25 C.F.R. § 309.2(a). An "Indian tribe" is defined as a federally recognized or state recognized Indian tribe. See 18 U.S.C. § 1159(c)(3); 25 C.F.R. §§ 309.2(e)(1), (2). The Code of Federal Regulations defines the term "Indian product" as "any art or craft product made by an Indian." 25 C.F.R. § 309.2(d); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1159(c)(2) (defining this term as "the meaning given [it] by the Secretary of the Interior"). The phrases "falsely suggests" and "Indian produced" are not defined in the statute or in the Code of Federal Regulations.
18 U.S.C. § 1159(b) sets forth a scienter requirement in order for criminal liability to attach:
Whoever knowingly violates subsection (a) shall—
(1) in the case of a first violation, if an individual, be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000; and
(2) in the case of subsequent violations, if an individual, be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than fifteen years, or both, and, if a person other than an individual, be fined not more than $5,000,000.
Id. (emphasis added).
II. APPROPRIATENESS OF FACIAL CHALLENGE
In this motion, Pourhassan raises a facial vagueness challenge to the criminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1159. During oral argument, defense counsel indicated that he anticipated bringing an "as applied" vagueness challenge to the statute after presentation of the evidence at trial, if such a motion was warranted. A preliminary matter is whether a facial challenge is appropriate at this stage of the proceedings.
According to the Tenth Circuit, a facial vagueness challenge is proper when a  statute ... threatens to chill constitutionally protected conduct, especially conduct protected by the First Amendment. If a statute is so vague that it can reasonably be interpreted to prohibit constitutionally protected speech as well as conduct the state may constitutionally forbid, people may choose to refrain from speaking rather than challenge the statute's constitutionality in their criminal prosecution. Thus, freedom of speech will be chilled. We allow a person who is prosecuted for conduct which the state may constitutionally forbid to challenge the statute as vague on its face, rather than restricting him to challenging it as applied to his conduct, because those who refrain from speech will never have a chance to make their claims in court. In this way the claims of those who would be silenced are heard. Vagueness and overbreadth challenges are similar in this respect.
United States v. Gaudreau, 860 F.2d 357, 360 (10th Cir.1988) (emphasis added); see also United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975) ("[V]agueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.") (quoted in United States v. Corrow, 119 F.3d 796, 803 (10th Cir.1997)); United States v. Day, 223 F.3d 1225, 1228 (10th Cir.2000) (same).3
Pourhassan hypothesizes that a literal reading of the statute implicates the rights of a category of individuals comprising manufacturers and sellers of products that are perceived by the public to be "Indian products": "a literal reading of the statute would arguably preclude any non-member of a tribe from making and selling [items such as totem poles, dream catchers or tomahawks] without expressly disclosing that the items were made by a non-tribal member." (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Indictment on Vagueness Grounds at 6.)4 As the Court understands his argument, Pourhassan contends that the statute implicates "constitutionally protected conduct," and thereby authorizes a facial vagueness challenge, because it (1) discourages a person from expressing himself by manufacturing products that are publicly-perceived to be "Indian products," and (2) forces a seller to speak by requiring him to disclose affirmatively the origin of such products or prohibits the seller from speaking or acting in a manner which, though innocent, may be (wrongly) interpreted by a potential purchaser as suggesting that the goods for sale are Indian products.5
 Notwithstanding the aforesaid argument, the rights of manufacturers of publicly-perceived "Indian products" are not affected by the statute since the statute only concerns the sale, not the manufacture, of goods. An artisan or other manufacturer may continue to express himself artistically through the creation of any products without fear of running afoul of the scope of the law. Accord Native Am. Arts, Inc. v. Village Originals, Inc., 25 F.Supp.2d 876, 881 (N.D.Ill.1998) ("[T]he [statute] does not interfere with the artistic content of [defendant's] merchandise. ..."). Hence, the statute does not "threaten[ ] to chill [the] constitutionally protected conduct," Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 360, of any artisan or individual wishing to express himself through the creation of goods which may be publicly-perceived to be "Indian products." Pourhassan's concern for individuals in the aforesaid category, therefore, cannot form the basis for pursuing a facial vagueness challenge to the statute.6
The rights of a second category of individuals are more compelling. Two district courts have considered the constitutionality of the 18 U.S.C. § 1159's civil counterpart, 25 U.S.C. § 305e, and concluded that the statute "does implicate First Amendment scrutiny since it involves the expressive aspects of commercial advertising." Village Originals, 25 F.Supp.2d at 880; see also Ho-Chunk Nation v. Nature's Gifts, Inc., 1999 WL 169319, *3 (N.D.Ill. Mar.19, 1999) ("[Defendant] concedes that the Act restricts commercial speech. Commercial speech, which is speech related solely to the economic interests of the speaker, is protected by the First Amendment.").7
This Court agrees with the conclusions of Village Originals and Nature's Gifts and rules that 18 U.S.C. § 1159 implicates constitutionally protected speech since, as discussed above, the statute in substance and effect may require some actors to make some affirmative statement regarding  the actual origin of certain products or be subject to prosecution. While First Amendment concerns exist in such a situation, it is of some import to note that those constitutional rights are minimal. Although "speech" is at issue, the statute restricts (or forces) some form of commercial advertising, which is generally afforded a lower level of scrutiny than non-commercial speech. See, e.g., Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 562-63, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980); U.S. West, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 182 F.3d 1224, 1233 (10th Cir.1999). Moreover, the Supreme Court has made clear that there are "material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech" such that "the First Amendment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed...." Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 650, 651 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985) (applying a rational relation test in reviewing a statutory requirement that attorney disclose contingent-fee arrangement particulars).
Based on the above analysis, the statute threatens speech and/or conduct, which is protected (albeit at a minimal level) by the First Amendment.8 Pursuant to the test set forth in Gaudreau, then, a facial vagueness challenge is proper. 860 F.2d at 360.
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Having concluded that a facial vagueness challenge is proper, the next issue is what standard of review applies. As a starting point, the Court begins with the longstanding principle that "[w]hen reviewing a statute alleged to be vague, courts must indulge a presumption that it is constitutional, and the statute must be upheld unless the court is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went beyond the confines of the Constitution." Day, 223 F.3d at 1228 (quoting Brecheisen v. Mondragon, 833 F.2d 238, 241 (10th Cir.1987)); Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F.3d 1493, 1500 (10th Cir.1995).
As a general matter, "the void for vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); see also Day, 223 F.3d at 1228 (quoting Corrow, 119 F.3d at 802). While there is some overlap between these two concerns, the Supreme Court and the Tenth Circuit have indicated that courts should treat each element separately. See Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357-58, 103 S.Ct. 1855; Corrow,  119 F.3d at 802; Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 359.
The meaning of "sufficient definitiveness" is an important question, and that preliminary issue is considered in some detail here. The level of specificity required in a particular statute, and hence the standard of review of the statute involved in this case, is dictated by several factors:
Criminal statutes must be more precise than civil statutes because the consequences of vagueness are more severe. Further, a scienter requirement may mitigate a criminal law's vagueness by ensuring that it punishes only those who are aware their conduct is unlawful. Also, regulatory statutes governing business activities may be less precise because the conduct proscribed is usually in a narrow category and the regulated enterprise may have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by inquiring of an administrative agency or resort to an administrative process. Finally, the Constitution demands more clarity of laws which threaten to inhibit constitutionally protected conduct, especially conduct protected by the First Amendment.
Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 360 (emphasis added). Since 18 U.S.C. § 1159 is a criminal statute, the first factor counsels in favor of more precision. Murphy v. Matheson, 742 F.2d 564, 570 (10th Cir.1984) (applying a "strict test of specificity" for a criminal statute that had no impact on constitutionally protected conduct). As noted above, 18 U.S.C. § 1159(b) contains a "knowing" scienter requirement, so the second factor requires less precision. 18 U.S.C. § 1159 is not a "regulatory statute governing business activities," so the third factor does not allow for less precision. The last factor favors slightly more precision since the statute threatens to inhibit at least some minimal constitutionally protected conduct. The Supreme Court has stated that this final factor is "perhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law...." Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).
In considering the appropriate level of scrutiny, it is of some help to consider two demonstrative cases. In Murphy, the Tenth Circuit applied a "strict test of specificity" when considering a Utah statute which regulated the possession, manufacture, delivery, and advertisement of drug paraphernalia. 742 F.2d at 566. The Utah statute subjected offenders to criminal penalties. See id. at 567 n. 3 (quoting the statute). Although the Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in a facial vagueness challenge, the Court employed a strict standard of review:
The statute here, like the ordinance in Flipside, regulates economic activity and contains a scienter requirement. Further ... the statute does not inhibit constitutionally protected rights. However, because violations carry criminal penalties, we apply a strict test of specificity.
Id. at 570 (emphasis added).9 The Court upheld the statute despite an acknowledgment by the Court that the phrase "drug paraphernalia" was a somewhat ambiguous term. See id.
The Supreme Court applied a strict test concerning vagueness in Kolender. In that case, the Supreme Court considered a California criminal statute which required that persons who loiter or wander on the streets provide "credible and reliable"  identification and to account for their presence when requested by a police officer. In a facial challenge, the Court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the phrase "credible and reliable" could not be defined with sufficient precision and was subject to multiple meanings. See Kolender, 461 U.S. at 361-62, 103 S.Ct. 1855 ("We conclude [the statute] is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it encourages arbitrary enforcement by failing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy the statute."). In so holding, the Court indicated that it was applying a higher level of scrutiny (thus distinguishing Flipside) because the statute imposed criminal sanctions and implicated constitutional rights See id. at 358, n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1855.10
Based upon the above cases, since this case involves a criminal statute which raises First Amendment concerns, a strict test concerning vagueness is demanded.11 With this in mind, the Court proceeds to consider whether the statute implicated in this case passes muster.
IV. ANALYSIS
A. FAIR NOTICE
The first element of the vagueness analysis is the fair notice requirement: "As generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited...." Id. at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855; Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 361-62. Pourhassan argues that the phrases "Indian produced" and "falsely suggests" are both unconstitutionally vague. (See Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Indictment on Vagueness Grounds at 6, 7.)
 Pourhassan contends that the phrase "Indian produced" is vague because it provides no guidance on how to handle certain products:
Is it sufficient that a member of an Indian tribe design and supervise the production? Does the participation of any Non Native American in the production render an item violative of the statute? For example, if a Native American hand-carved a wooden totem pole, but non-Native Americans assisted in the rough-cutting, and subsequently cleaned and varnished the item prior to sale, would the item be "Indian produced"? Must the seller disclose the participation of a non-member in the process?
(Id. at 7.) As discussed above, the Code of Federal Regulations defines the term "Indian product" as "any art or craft product made by an Indian." 25 C.F.R. § 309.2(d); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1159(c)(2) (defining this term as "the meaning given [it] by the Secretary of the Interior"). In a brief discussion of this phrase, the government responds that "[s]imply stated, `Indian produced' means made by an Indian as that term is defined in § 1159 and C.F.R. § 309.2(a)." (Supplemental Mem. in Supp. of Government's Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Indictment on Vagueness Grounds at 23.)
The Court agrees with the government and rules that items which are "Indian produced" are "Indian products." The phrase "Indian product" is not vague and the phrase means what it says: "any art or craft product made by an Indian." 25 C.F.R. § 309.2(d). It does not include products which are jointly manufactured by Indians and non-Indians or products which are designed by an Indian and made by a non-Indian. The phrase "Indian produced," therefore, is not unconstitutionally vague.
Pourhassan also contends that the phrase "falsely suggests" language is vague because it is unclear whether the phrase requires an affirmative misrepresentation (such as false labeling or an oral or written warranty). While Pourhassan is correct that the phrase is somewhat ambiguous, the vagueness of the term is lessened when the statute is read as a whole.
Of particular importance is the well-established principle that "a scienter requirement may mitigate a law's vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of the notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed." Flipside, 455 U.S. at 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186; see also Murphy, 742 F.2d at 573. However,
it is evident that ... the "scienter" [which mitigates vagueness] meant must be some other kind of scienter than that traditionally known to the common law-the knowing performance of an act with the intent to bring about that thing, whatever it is, which the statute proscribes, knowledge of the fact that it is so proscribed being immaterial.... Such scienter would clarify nothing; a clarificatory "scienter" must envisage not only a knowing what is done but a knowing that what is done is unlawful or, at least, so "wrong" that it is probably unlawful.
Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67, 87 n. 98 (1960) (emphasis added) (cited in Flipside, 455 U.S. at 499 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 1186). In Murphy, for example, the Tenth Circuit held that an intent scienter was sufficient to save a statute which criminalized the possession, selling, or manufacturing of drug paraphernalia from a vagueness challenge because
in order to have a conviction [it is necessary] that a person possess, sell or manufacture an item with the intent that the item be drug paraphernalia. Since the person must actually intend that an item  be drug paraphernalia he has notice of his criminal act and due process is satisfied.
742 F.2d at 574 (citations omitted).
In this case, criminal liability attaches only when a person "knowingly" violates 18 U.S.C. § 1159(a). See 18 U.S.C. § 1159(b). Reading 18 U.S.C. §§ 1159(a) and (b) together, then, an individual runs afoul of the law only when he knowingly makes a false suggestion. Stated another way, a seller must know that his words or acts suggest a falsity. In its most simple formulation, then, a seller is liable under the statute only when he knowingly lies. While one may imagine different variations of how a seller could knowingly lie (e.g., an outright misrepresentation or a false label), the phrase does not criminalize a seller's innocent acts which are simply misinterpreted by a buyer. The statute provides adequate notice to the public of what conduct is forbidden: a seller may not knowingly lie by making the false suggestion that an item for sale was made by an Indian when, in fact, it was not.12
B. ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS
The second element of the vagueness analysis is the adequacy of the enforcement standards: whether the statute "authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement" by establishing a "standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections." Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357, 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855; Gaudreau, 860 F.2d at 363-64.
This element envisions a slightly different consideration than that considered in the discussion of fair notice, above. In Coates v. Cincinnati, for example, the Court invalidated a statute that criminalized the acts of three or more persons assembling on a sidewalk who "there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by...." 402 U.S. 611, 611 n. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971). The Court stated:
[T]he ordinance['s use of the word "annoying"] is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.
Id. at 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686. Since no standard for "annoying" was enunciated in the statute, the Court believed that it provided for policemen, prosecutors, and juries to make up their own standard based entirely on their own preferences and predilections.
As set forth above, 18 U.S.C. § 1159 prohibits a seller from knowingly lying about the origin of non-Indian goods.  While a knowing false suggestion (the prohibited act) might take several forms (and it will ultimately be a jury's responsibility to determine whether any particular seller made a knowingly false suggestion that an item was Indian produced), it is not vague in a way that authorizes or encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.
V. CONCLUSION
Based on the analysis above, 18 U.S.C. § 1159 is not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's motion to dismiss therefore is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.


FootNotes 
1. During argument, defense counsel indicated that he was satisfied with the specification of the factual predicate of the Indictment that has been provided by the government, and stated that he was withdrawing and no longer pursuing his motion for a bill of particulars. Accordingly, this Order only addresses defendant's motion to dismiss.

2. 18 U.S.C. § 1159 was amended in 1990. The former law provided:
Whoever willfully offers or displays for sale any goods ... as Indian products or Indian products of a particular Indian tribe or group, resident within the United States or the Territory of Alaska, when such person knows such goods are not Indian products or are not Indian products of the particular Indian tribe or group, shall be fined not more than $500 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

3. The Gaudreau decision sets forth one additional circumstance when a facial challenge is appropriate: "In a declaratory judgment action [where] no one has [yet] been charged ... the court cannot evaluate the statute as applied. In these cases, the challenger may attempt to facially attack the statute as `vague in all of its applications.'" 860 F.2d at 360-61. Since Pourhassan has been charged under this statute and this is not a declaratory judgment action, this second circumstance is inapposite to the case at hand.

4. The fact that Pourhassan's vagueness argument is difficult to distinguish from an over-breadth argument (as evidenced by Pourhassan's use of the term "overbroad" throughout his memoranda) is of little concern since the Supreme Court often speaks of the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines together. See, e.g., Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983) ("[W]e have traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines."); see also Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law § 20.9 at 274 (3d ed.1999) ("The problem of vagueness in statutes regulating speech activities is based on the same rationale as the overbreadth doctrine and the Supreme Court often speaks of them together.").

5. As an example of the seller's behavior that may be innocent but wrongly interpreted by a buyer as a suggestion that the good for sale are "Indian products," consider the situation of a seller of non-Indian products who dresses in traditional "Indian" garb in order to express himself or (more likely) in order to attract more business. Arguably, the seller of non-Indian products would be prohibited from such behavior because of the possibility that a potential buyer would equate the Indian garb with a suggestion by the seller that the goods in question were manufactured by Indians, despite the fact that the seller has not made any affirmative representation about the origin of the goods.

6. The majority opinion in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983), could be interpreted as support for a conclusion that a manufacturer's speech is threatened by 18 U.S.C. § 1159. In Kolender, the Supreme Court considered a California statute which required that persons who loiter or wander on the streets provide "credible and reliable" identification and to account for their presence when requested by a police officer. Without much discussion, the majority concluded that the California statute "implicate[d] consideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement." Id. at 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855; but see id. at 374, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (J. White, dissenting) ("Here, the majority makes a vague reference to potential suppression of First Amendment liberties, but the precise nature of the liberties threatened are never mentioned.").
An argument could be made that Kolender favors a conclusion that 18 U.S.C. § 1159 implicates consideration of the rights of manufacturers or artisans to create art. While this is a legitimate argument, the Court concludes that 18 U.S.C. § 1159 is a different statute and the broad language of Kolender is inapplicable to the instant case. In any event, the point is largely moot because, as discussed at length below, the Court agrees that Pourhassan is entitled to make a facial challenge.

7. 25 U.S.C. § 305e imposes civil liability upon an individual who (as in its criminal counterpart) "offers or displays for sale or sells a good ... in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization...." Id.

8. The real danger of the statute in this case is that it arguably threatens to force speech, not quash it. While the language of Zauderer makes clear that the First Amendment is implicated by disclosure requirements, it is not immediately obvious that the test set forth in Gaudreau for the appropriateness of a facial challenge (which speaks in terms of a statute that threatens to "chill" constitutionally protected conduct) means to apply to such First Amendment concerns. One response to this is that the statute at issue in this case does threaten to "chill" a seller's right to remain silent, which is recognized as constitutionally protected conduct. See, e.g., Russo v. Central Sch. Dist., 469 F.2d 623, 634 (2d Cir.1972) ("[T]he right to remain silent in the face of an illegitimate demand for speech is as much a part of First Amendment protections as the right to speak out in the face of an illegitimate demand for silence."). In any event, there are no logical reasons to distinguish the types of First Amendment concerns implicated in the instant case. The Court concludes that the constitutional concerns implicated in this statute are real, recognizable, and sufficient to allow a facial vagueness challenge.

9. A fair reading of Murphy is that a strict vagueness test applies whenever a court evaluates a criminal statutes. A fortiori, a strict vagueness test would apply in the instant case since the statute implicates some First Amendment concerns.

10. Kolender is not directly on point. According to the Kolender Court, the California statute "implicates consideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement." Id. at 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855. The opinion does not directly address the statutes' requirement that a suspect identify himself (which may implicate an individual's First Amendment right by forcing him to speak, like the statute at issue here). In addition, the speech at issue in this case is commercial speech, which, as discussed above, is afforded a lower level of constitutional protection than the constitutional right at issue in Kolender. Also, the statute at issue in Kolender does not appear to contain a scienter requirement like the statute at issue in this case. See id. at 354 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (quoting the language of the California statute).

11. The conclusion that a strict vagueness test is not necessarily obvious. In Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982), for example, the Supreme Court used a low level of scrutiny. In that case, the Supreme Court rejected a pre-enforcement facial vagueness challenge to a "quasi-criminal" civil statute which regulated the sale of items "designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs." Id. at 491, 499, 102 S.Ct. 1186. The Court held that the phrase "designed or marketed for use" was sufficiently specific in the context of the statute at issue because a "business person of ordinary intelligence would understand that [these] term[s] refer[ ] to the design of the manufacturer [or marketing of the item], not the intent of the retailer or customer." Id. at 501, 102 S.Ct. 1186. In the later Kolender decision, the Supreme Court re-emphasized that the Flipside Court was applying a "less strict vagueness test because its subject matter [i.e., the regulation of business behavior] is often more narrow [than noncommercial free speech or free association contexts]." 461 U.S. at 358 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (emphasis added); see also Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (applying a less stringent vagueness analysis "[b]ecause of the factors differentiating military society from civilian society.").
While the instant case also involves commercial speech, the statute here is different from the one considering in Flipside because 18 U.S.C. § 1159 provides for criminal sanctions. As noted in Murphy, the criminal/civil distinction is important (and perhaps dispositive).

12. To be clear, consider the following sets of hypotheticals. In the first, Seller X sells an item he knows to be made entirely by a non-Indian. If Seller X knowingly lies to Buyer B by indicating that the item is Indian produced, he violates the statute. If Seller X knowingly lies to Buyer B by indicating that the item is produced by the combined efforts of an Indian artisan and a non-Indian artisan, he does not violate the statute (though he may be liable for fraud under a separate statute). If Seller X tells Buyer B the truth, or if Buyer B misunderstands the innocent acts of Seller X to be some indication that the item is entirely Indian produced, Seller X does not violate the statute.
In the second hypothetical, Seller Y sells an item he knows to be jointly made by an Indian and a non-Indian. If Seller Y knowingly lies to Buyer B by indicating that the item is entirely Indian produced, he violates the statute. If Seller Y tells Buyer B the truth, or if Buyer B misunderstands the innocent acts of Seller Y to be some indication that the item is entirely Indian produced, Seller Y does not violate the statute.
In the last hypothetical, Seller Z sells an item that is entirely Indian produced. Seller Z cannot violate the statute.

CytoDyn Inc. Names Dr. Nader Pourhassan New CEO; Announces New Chief Scientific Officer
Download PDF
    LUTZ, Fla.--
      CytoDyn Inc. (the "Company") (CYDY), a biotechnology company focused on
      the development of new therapies for combating infection with immune
      deficiency viruses, today announced the appointment of Dr. Nader
      Pourhassan as the company’s new interim Chief Executive Officer and Dr.
      Richard Trauger as its new Chief Scientific Officer.
    

      Dr. Pourhassan brings over 20 years of advanced engineering and
      mathematics expertise as well as strong business acumen, to his new
      role. Prior to his new position as CEO, Dr. Pourhassan served as the
      Company’s Managing Director of Business Development, and before that, as
      its Chief Operating Officer. He received his Bachelor of Science degree
      from Utah State University in 1985, his Master of Science degree from
      Brigham Young University in 1990, and his Ph.D. in Mechanical
      Engineering from the University of Utah in 1998. He succeeds former
      President and CEO Kenneth J. Van Ness.
    

      “The Board unanimously voted on Monday to promote Dr. Nader Pourhassan
      to interim CEO, effective immediately. Through his leadership and the
      CytoDyn team’s hard work, we believe that CytoDyn can become a global
      leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said Gregory A. Gould, Chairman
      of the Board of CytoDyn.
    

      The appointment of Dr. Pourhassan to CEO follows the recent promotion of
      Dr. Richard Trauger from Managing Director of Science to Chief
      Scientific Officer on August 23, 2012. Dr. Trauger has over 20 years of
      experience in the HIV/AIDS space, working as head of the immunology
      research group for the Immune Response Corporation’s Remune program and
      as the Senior Director of Cancer and Infectious Disease for Hollis-Eden
      Pharmaceuticals. He received his Ph.D. from the University of South
      Carolina School of Medicine in 1986 in biomedical science, specializing
      in retrovirology.
    

      “Both Dr. Trauger and I are very excited about the future of CytoDyn and
      are focused on moving the company forward. With the potential
      acquisition of PRO-140, we believe that CytoDyn will be well-positioned
      as the next leader in the development of monoclonal antibody therapy for
      the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS,” said Dr. Pourhassan.
    

The Company


      The Company is a biotechnology company focused on the development of new
      therapies for combating infection with immune deficiency viruses and
      other antibody applications. The Company's proprietary drug candidate
      Cytolin(R) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD11a, a cellular
      antigen that is a component of the cellular adhesion molecule LFA-1. The
      Company intends to explore the clinical development of Cytolin(R) for
      persons infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ("HIV") to
      determine if it could perturb the natural course of HIV infection. The
      Company recently completed a humanized antibody construct of Cytolin(R),
      filed a provisional patent for its use, and manufacturing discussions
      are underway. In addition, the Company is exploring the possible
      application of its existing proprietary monoclonal antibody for the
      treatment of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ("FIV"), a retroviral
      infection in cats. The Company recently filed for a provisional patent
      for the use of these antibodies as well as selected small molecule
      antagonists and agonists for the treatment of FIV, and filed an
      application for registration of the trademark CytoFeline, intended for
      use in conjunction with veterinary preparations for the treatment of
      FIV. For more information about Cytolin(R), CytoFeline(TM) and the
      Company please go to www.cytodyn.com.

It also shares a more important message -- that of the common heritage of Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and the simple commandment that they all share -- Human beings should love one another, and do good. This book has been written for Moslems, so that they might be encouraged to read the Koran for themselves, and question why their religious authorities have presumed to be the sole interpreters of this important religious work. This book has been written for Jews and Christians, so that they might recognize the heritage they share with Islam. In the Koran is the passage: "[God] has sent down the book to you with truth to confirm whatever existed before. He sent down the Torah and the New Testament." Christian readers, especially, will be interested to learn that the Koran teaches that Jesus was God's best prophet, and that Christians will be placed above non-believers until the Day of Judgement. And finally, this book has been written for anyone interested in learning the truth about one of the world's oldest and most wide-spread religious traditions.Product IdentifiersISBN-10097119307XISBN-139780971193079Key DetailsAuthorNader PourhassanFormatHardcoverPublication Date2002-07-01LanguageEnglishPublisherBarbed Wire PublishingPublication Year2002 Ratings and Reviews5.01 product rating5140302010Most relevant reviewsby 80sgirl17Oct 30, 2006A Must Read!This is such a great book! It is well-written in simple language, with ample proof shown from the Quran to back up his statements.  It is in NO WAY a book that ridicules Islam, as I was a little weary about when I saw the title.  But rather it explains how the Islam that is preached and practiced today by most Muslims is actually not as Allah (God) has ordered.  Islam has been corrupted - sometimes intentionally, sometimes purely unintentionally due to lack of education - over the centuries to become a religion that is feared by most non-Muslims...  Anyone who has thought about becoming Muslim or who just wants to understand Islam should definately read this book!  It really should be REQUIRED reading for EVERY person today who calls themself a true Muslim - then there would not be so much violence in this world...

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Dr. Nader Pourhassan: HIV Drug Could Be ‘Game-Changer’
August 6, 2015
VANCOUVER’S THE COLUMBIAN–If all goes as planned, the Vancouver-based biotechnology company CytoDyn Inc. will introduce a “game-changing” HIV therapy for sale sometime in 2017.
“We could be commercialized in the first half of 2017,” said Nader Pourhassan, president and CEO of the company, which has seismic ambitions. “This is a very exciting time,” he added.
This is indeed an exciting time for CytoDyn, a firm that Pourhassan pulled from the verge of bankruptcy in 2008 and whose headquarters is tucked inside an upper-floor office on downtown’s Main Street. The reason for the excitement: PRO 140.
It’s a self-injectable antibody — not a chemically synthesized drug — that belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as “entry inhibitors” that shield healthy cells from viral infection and that block transmission of the virus to others.
Or, as Pourhassan put it: “You’re blocking the virus from opening the door.”
PRO 140 has gone through multiple clinical trials, each showing reduced or controlled HIV viral loads. What’s more, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has designated PRO 140 as a “fast-track” drug candidate. The FDA’s fast-track process speeds the development and review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs.
To be certain, PRO 140 isn’t a cure. However, CytoDyn believes it has advantages, including less toxicity and fewer side effects, over current treatments. It also would replace gobs of daily pills with one shot per week. In a recent federal regulatory filing, the company, which is traded publicly as a penny stock, said PRO 140 “has the potential to be the first long-acting (weekly or every other week), self-administered HIV therapy.”
“In the world of HIV right now, the only thing you have is pills,” Pourhassan said. “Once the patient misses a pill, they become resistant to one class. Then (they) have to change to others. Now you’ve got AIDS.”
With PRO 140, he said, you have a “huge game-changer on many fronts.”
Challenges to CytoDyn loom, though. It remains unprofitable. As of May 31 of this year, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, “we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $71.5 million.” The company has three local employees, including Pourhassan, and several independent consultants assisting with research and manufacturing activities.
It’s also up against pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer and Gilead Sciences. “We expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share,” CytoDyn said in its SEC filing.
Still, Pourhassen, who was born in Iran and who has a PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Utah, exudes confidence about CytoDyn’s future. “I can tell you,” he said, “in the past we never failed to raise money.”
In fact, Pourhassen saved the firm from bankruptcy after joining it in 2008 as chief operating officer. He deferred his salary and used tens of thousands of his own dollars “doing road trips and raising money,” he said, to shore up CytoDyn.
The company found its home base in Vancouver after Pourhassen decided to relocate its headquarters from Lake Oswego,O Ore., to ease the commute for the firm’s chief financial officer, Mike Mulholland, who lives in Vancouver.
In the U.S. alone, Pourhassen said, PRO 140 could sell “at least a billion dollars.” If all goes as planned, “we help humanity,” he said. “That’s something that goes on our r?sum? for the rest of our lives.”
