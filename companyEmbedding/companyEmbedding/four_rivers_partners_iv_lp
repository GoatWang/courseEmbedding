Four Rivers TMS Asset Management Software Integrates to Versus RTLS

Pittsburgh, PA - February 14, 2013 - Hospitals wishing to track the real-time locations of mobile medical equipment while using Four Rivers®Total Maintenance System (TMS®) will experience improved workflows, thanks to a recent integration with the Versus Real-time Locating System (RTLS).


The integration, already in use at Children’s of Alabama in Birmingham, features a single-source procurement process, where a Versus asset tag ID is entered once into the TMS software. Through a bi-directional interface, the asset is automatically registered within the Versus system so its location can be immediately tracked.  Versus then provides real-time location updates to TMS, permitting enterprise-wide location visibility.

An average hospital can lose $4,000 per day in lost wages due to time spent searching for mobile assets such as IV pumps. Additionally, many hospitals purchase 20% more equipment than necessary just to ensure availability in case inventory can’t be found. By monitoring the real-time locations of these mobile assets and tracking how often they’re used in patient care, hospitals can dramatically decrease operational costs and capital investments while increasing staff and patient satisfaction.

Biomedical and other staff can quickly locate assets through the RTLS location field in TMS, where they also track maintenance and other asset details.  Clinical staff in patient care units can view equipment locations on Versus Glance-and-Go™ boards, displayed as either a floor plan of the unit, or as a list view of available equipment. Inventory control staff may also use Versus’ full-featured par-level asset management software to automate replenishment functions.

Children’s of Alabama uses Four Rivers TMS integrated with Versus to track approximately 3,000 mobile assets, including IV pumps, beds and stretchers. Biomedical staff keep track of preventative maintenance, warranties and recall notifications in TMS, where they now know an asset’s real-time location thanks to the RTLS integration.

“By combining Versus’ real-time location data with our TMS, we are enabling our customers to work smarter,” says Larry Shields, Product Coordinator with Four Rivers. “Our joint customers will now be able to use the best features of both systems, making operations more efficient.”

After the RTLS asset tag ID is added to TMS, the hospitals also have immediate access to equipment and location information in Versus software. For example, hospitals can use Versus’ par-level feature to ensure optimal inventory of IV and other pumps in patient care areas. Clinicians can also access lists of available equipment and their locations via Versus Glance-and-Go boards on overhead screens or workstation web browsers.


“The integration with Four Rivers TMS expands the benefits of RTLS for biomedical engineering without placing additional process burdens on the department,” explains Kevin Jackson, Chief Technology Officer for Versus. “Versus seamlessly integrates real-time asset tracking with the TMS features, making it easy for inventory control staff to better serve the facility, physicians,and nurses.This interoperability, a cornerstone of Versus solutions, ultimately improves the efficiency of patient care.”

Health care software company Four Rivers Software Systems Inc. is beefing up its product line with the an eye toward capturing more smaller care facilities as customers.
Four Rivers acquired the a pair of software applications called HarvestCEMS and HarvestFMS as well as their customers from PartsSource Inc. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.













 Enlarge

















 


Four Rivers develops asset management software for health care customers. Four Rivers software is used to help hospitals track equipment, everything from IV pumps and radiology machines to facilities and HVAC. The software tracks items including maintenance records, location and work order schedules. Historically, Four Rivers serves large customers with more than 250 beds but didn’t have a product offering for smaller organizations that have less than 200 beds, said M. Lynn O’Donnell, director of marketing.




The acquisition fixes that.
The Harvest software is a slimmed-down version of what Four Rivers has been selling larger organizations. The company has been trying to sell to these smaller organizations but the existing software was more than those potential customers needed and could be overwhelming, O’Donnell said.
Since Harvest already has customers and brand recognition it allows Four Rivers to get into that market quicker. The Forest Hills company has 70 employees and isn’t planning to add staff as a result of the acquisition since current staff will be able to handle the added product offering.
The company will continue to service the existing Harvest customers and wont require upgrade to Four Rivers flagship software.




 


“We welcome the existing Harvest customer base,” said Four Rivers Chairman and CEO Henry Wilde in a written statement. “Customers can expect no interruption in service and no need to make any change. Our plan is to support and enhance the Harvest family of products.”

Four Rivers TMS Asset Management Software Integrates to Versus RTLS


				Posted by Versus

(Traverse City, Michigan, February 14, 2013) — Hospitals wishing to track the real-time locations of mobile medical equipment while using Four Rivers® Total Maintenance System (TMS®) will experience improved workflows, thanks to a recent integration with the Versus Real-time Locating System (RTLS).
The integration, already in use at Children’s of Alabama in Birmingham, features a single-source procurement process, where a Versus asset tag ID is entered once into the TMS software. Through a bi-directional interface, the asset is automatically registered within the Versus system so its location can be immediately tracked. Versus then provides real-time location updates to TMS, permitting enterprise-wide location visibility.
An average hospital can lose $4,000 per day in lost wages due to time spent searching for mobile assets such as IV pumps. Additionally, many hospitals purchase 20% more equipment than necessary just to ensure availability in case inventory can’t be found. By monitoring the real-time locations of these mobile assets and tracking how often they’re used in patient care, hospitals can dramatically decrease operational costs and capital investments while increasing staff and patient satisfaction.
Biomedical and other staff can quickly locate assets through the RTLS location field in TMS, where they also track maintenance and other asset details. Clinical staff in patient care units can view equipment locations on Versus Glance-and-Go™ boards, displayed as either a floorplan of the unit, or as a list view of available equipment. Inventory control staff may also use Versus’ full-featured par-level asset management software to automate replenishment functions.
Children’s of Alabama uses Four Rivers TMS integrated with Versus to track approximately 3,000 mobile assets, including IV pumps, beds and stretchers. Biomedical staff keep track of preventative maintenance, warranties and recall notifications in TMS, where they now know an asset’s real-time location thanks to the RTLS integration.
“By combining Versus’ real-time location data with our TMS, we are enabling our customers to work smarter,” says Larry Shields, Product Coordinator with Four Rivers. “Our joint customers will now be able to use the best features of both systems, making operations more efficient.”
After the RTLS asset tag ID is added to TMS, the hospitals also have immediate access to equipment and location information in Versus software. For example, hospitals can use Versus’ par-level feature to ensure optimal inventory of IV and other pumps in patient care areas. Clinicians can also access lists of available equipment and their locations via Versus Glance-and-Go boards on overhead screens or workstation web browsers.
“The integration with Four Rivers TMS expands the benefits of RTLS for biomedical engineering without placing additional process burdens on the department,” explains Kevin Jackson, Chief Technology Officer for Versus. “Versus seamlessly integrates real-time asset tracking with the TMS features, making it easy for inventory control staff to better serve the facility, physicians, and nurses. This interoperability, a cornerstone of Versus solutions, ultimately improves the efficiency of patient care.”
