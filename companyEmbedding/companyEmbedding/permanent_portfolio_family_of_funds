Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment performance, current to the most recent month-end, may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. It can be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. For standardized performance, click here.
The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment companies. A hard copy may be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.
Each of the investment products or services referred to on this site may be offered only to investors residing in the United States. This site should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment products or services to investors residing outside the United States.
The information provided on this site is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to certain laws or regulations. Because of the global nature of the Internet, all persons and entities accessing this site do so on their own initiative and agree to comply with all applicable local laws and regulations.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Aggressive Growth Portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of U.S. stock market investments, in general, are declining. The Portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
Short-Term Treasury Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the Short-Term Treasury Portfolio. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
Versatile Bond Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging markets. In addition, certain investments may be illiquid and may be difficult to purchase, sell, or value. 
Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.  Earnings growth is not a measure of the Fund's future performance.
Opinions expressed and views on the securities mentioned are those of Michael J. Cuggino as of the dates provided. They are subject to change at any time, are not guaranteed, and should not be considered investment advice. References to other mutual funds or ETFs should not be considered an offer of those securities.  The hypothetical $10,000 investment made in the Portfolio on the dates noted assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charge or redemption fees.  It does not imply any future performance.
Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Fund assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.  Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.
Fund holdings can be reviewed by clicking on the following fact sheets —  Permanent Portfolio, Short-Term Treasury Portfolio, Versatile Bond Portfolio, and Aggressive Growth Portfolio. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security.
Citigroup 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index tracks the performance of U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining maturity of three months.  Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average of the stock prices of thirty large companies and represents a widely recognized unmanaged portfolio of common stocks.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index is a market-capitalization weighted index of five hundred unmanaged common stocks and is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. The Hang Seng Index is a free-float capitalization-weighted index of a selection of companies from the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.  The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is an equity valuation measure defined as market price per share divided by annual earnings per share.  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices.  National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) is a national securities exchange that is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group. The NASDAQ Stock Market is comprised of three market tiers: (1) the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (2) the NASDAQ Global Market, formerly the NASDAQ National Market, and (3) the NASDAQ Capital Market, formerly the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. For a company to trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market, it must meet the listing requirements of at least one of these three market tiers. Some of these listing requirements include meeting specified minimum thresholds for the number of publicly traded shares, total market value, stock price and number of shareholders.   The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that index.  U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to majority of its most significant trading partners. This index is similar to other trade-weighted indexes, which also use the exchange rates from the same major currencies.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) is a price-weighted average of 20 transportation stocks traded in the U.S.  The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index represents the homebuilding sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index.  The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index comprises those companies included in the S&P 500 that are classified as members of the GICS consumer discretionary sector.  The S&P 500 Energy Index comprises companies included in the S&P 500 that are classified as members of the energy sector as per the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).  Earnings per share (EPS) is a company’s profit divided by its number of common outstanding shares​. Indexes do not include management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Investments cannot be made directly in an index.  Beta is a measure of systematic risk or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta.  Investment in gold involves risks, such as the possibility to generate no interest or dividends, offering only the potential for price appreciation. Gold is subject to market risk and has experienced volatile fluctuations in price from time to time. The Swiss franc is subject to the risk that inflation will decrease in the U.S. or rise in Switzerland. While Switzerland has historically been a politically stable nation, Swiss government bonds are subject to some risk of default and their credit quality is not rated by certain U.S. rating agencies.  Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar investment objectives.  Alpha is the mean of the excess return of the manager over beta times benchmark. Alpha is a measure of risk (beta)-adjusted return. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.  Standard deviation measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean and is often used as a measure of risk. A large deviation implies there have been large swings in the return series of the manager.   FANG is representative of four of the most popular and best-performing tech stocks in recent memory — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL).

PERFORMANCE
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment performance, current to the most recent month-end, may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. It can be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Performance data shown with load reflects the Class A shares maximum sales charge of 5.00% and the Class C shares maximum deferred sales charge of 1.00%. Performance data shown as no load does not reflect the current maximum sales charges. Had the sales charge been included, the fund's returns would be lower. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.

Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment performance, current to the most recent month-end, may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. It can be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142.

The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment companies. A hard copy may be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Aggressive Growth Portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of U.S. stock market investments, in general, are declining. The Portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
Short-Term Treasury Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the Short-Term Treasury Portfolio. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
Versatile Bond Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging markets. In addition, certain investments may be illiquid and may be difficult to purchase, sell, or value. 
Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.  Earnings growth is not a measure of the Fund's future performance.
Opinions expressed and views on the securities mentioned are those of Michael J. Cuggino as of the dates provided. They are subject to change at any time, are not guaranteed, and should not be considered investment advice. References to other mutual funds or ETFs should not be considered an offer of those securities.  The hypothetical $10,000 investment made in the Portfolio on the dates noted assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charge or redemption fees.  It does not imply any future performance.
Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Fund assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.  Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.

Citigroup 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index tracks the performance of U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining maturity of three months.  Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average of the stock prices of thirty large companies and represents a widely recognized unmanaged portfolio of common stocks.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index is a market-capitalization weighted index of five hundred unmanaged common stocks and is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. The Hang Seng Index is a free-float capitalization-weighted index of a selection of companies from the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.  The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is an equity valuation measure defined as market price per share divided by annual earnings per share.

National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) is a national securities exchange that is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group. The NASDAQ Stock Market is comprised of three market tiers: (1) the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (2) the NASDAQ Global Market, formerly the NASDAQ National Market, and (3) the NASDAQ Capital Market, formerly the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. For a company to trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market, it must meet the listing requirements of at least one of these three market tiers. Some of these listing requirements include meeting specified minimum thresholds for the number of publicly traded shares, total market value, stock price and number of shareholders.   The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that index.

Earnings per share (EPS) is a company’s profit divided by its number of common outstanding shares​. Indexes do not include management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Investments cannot be made directly in an index.  Beta is a measure of systematic risk or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta.  Investment in gold involves risks, such as the possibility to generate no interest or dividends, offering only the potential for price appreciation. Gold is subject to market risk and has experienced volatile fluctuations in price from time to time. The Swiss franc is subject to the risk that inflation will decrease in the U.S. or rise in Switzerland. While Switzerland has historically been a politically stable nation, Swiss government bonds are subject to some risk of default and their credit quality is not rated by certain U.S. rating agencies.  Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar investment objectives.  Alpha is the mean of the excess return of the manager over beta times benchmark. Alpha is a measure of risk (beta)-adjusted return. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.  Standard deviation measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean and is often used as a measure of risk. A large deviation implies there have been large swings in the return series of the manager.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1982 and its first offering was a mutual fund called the Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX).[2] The Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) was founded in 1987.[2] A stock fund called Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) was opened in 1990[2] and Michael Cuggino was hired to manage it.[3] In 1991, the company added the Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) which invests 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2] Cuggino, a Certified Public Accountant took control of the Permanent Portfolio fund in 2003 when his predecessor was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[2][4][5] Other company leaders include: James H. Andrews as Treasurer, Susan K. Freund as Chief Compliance Officer and Derek D. Hyatt as their Senior Investment Analyst.[2]
Products[edit]
Permanent Portfolio fund[edit]
The company's flagship fund was established in 1982 by Terry Coxan and John Chandler and "mimicked an early version of the permanent portfolio concept" of Browne.[6] According to Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine it was designed to neutralize high inflation by investing in precious metals, Swiss bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and natural resource stocks. This was similar to Browne's strategy of 25% of a portfolio in bonds, stocks, cash and gold with annual re-balancing. Browne's strategy was portrayed as a "fail-safe" investment strategy and was outlined in his 1999 book Fail-Safe Investing.[7] The Permanent Portfolio mutual fund, however, is more complex than Browne's original concept and has six asset categories.[4] The fund aims to invest in a fixed percentage of uncorrelated, asset categories to minimize risk in changing economic climates.[2] These include 35% in government bonds, 25% in gold and silver bullion, 15% in growth stocks, 10% in cash and Swiss francs and 15% in energy, mining, and real estate stocks.[7] The funds concept is to "preserve capital and provide low risk growth" through diversification.[8] From 1982 through 2008, the fund's assets under management (AUM) were less than $50 million but they grew to $1 billion in 2007, $3.4 billion in 2008 and $5 billion in 2009.[4] As of 2012 the fund had $17 billion in assets under management[9] with 20% invested in gold bullion[10] and a "relatively high" 0.71% annual management fee.[11][12][13]
In the 1990s the fund had poor shareholder retention as it "badly trailed" most stock funds.[14] However, between Feb. 2, 2001 and February 2, 2011, the fund averaged an 11 percent annualized return in comparison to a 1.6 percent annualized return for the S&P 500 index. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37% in the financial crisis of 2008, the Permanent Portfolio fund lost 8%.[7] However, from its 1982 inception through 2010, the fund had average annual gains of 6.5% in comparison to the S&P 500 stock index's 10.6% average annual gain over the same period.[15] The 2012 book The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy discusses the funds benefits and limitations. The authors say that the fund manager's investment decisions and the costs associated with an actively managed mutual fund are a downside when compared to an index fund, but points out that the fund's management fee of 0.78% per year is below the mutual fund average.[6] According to a 2006 article in Kiplinger's personal finance magazine the fund has delivered on its goal of "long term stability with occasional market beating returns." [16]
Aggressive Growth Portfolio[edit]
The Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) is described as a "diversified, multi-cap core, U.S. equity fund" with the goal of long term appreciation.[2] In 2002 it had $24 million in assets under management and consisted of large and mid-sized companies.[3] In the ten years prior to March 2002 it ranked #34 amongst 797 other diversified mutual funds and had a stock management turnover rate of 6%.[3] During that period it never had a negative year and its average annual gain was 2% better than the S&P 500 Index. In 2002 its annual management fee was 1.29%.[3]
Other[edit]
The company also offers a Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) which it describes as a short-term U.S. Treasury bonds fund.[2] The firm's Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) is said to invest 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1982 and its first offering was a mutual fund called the Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX).[2] The Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) was founded in 1987.[2] A stock fund called Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) was opened in 1990[2] and Michael Cuggino was hired to manage it.[3] In 1991, the company added the Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) which invests 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2] Cuggino, a Certified Public Accountant took control of the Permanent Portfolio fund in 2003 when his predecessor was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[2][4][5] Other company leaders include: James H. Andrews as Treasurer, Susan K. Freund as Chief Compliance Officer and Derek D. Hyatt as their Senior Investment Analyst.[2]
Products[edit]
Permanent Portfolio fund[edit]
The company's flagship fund was established in 1982 by Terry Coxan and John Chandler and "mimicked an early version of the permanent portfolio concept" of Browne.[6] According to Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine it was designed to neutralize high inflation by investing in precious metals, Swiss bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and natural resource stocks. This was similar to Browne's strategy of 25% of a portfolio in bonds, stocks, cash and gold with annual re-balancing. Browne's strategy was portrayed as a "fail-safe" investment strategy and was outlined in his 1999 book Fail-Safe Investing.[7] The Permanent Portfolio mutual fund, however, is more complex than Browne's original concept and has six asset categories.[4] The fund aims to invest in a fixed percentage of uncorrelated, asset categories to minimize risk in changing economic climates.[2] These include 35% in government bonds, 25% in gold and silver bullion, 15% in growth stocks, 10% in cash and Swiss francs and 15% in energy, mining, and real estate stocks.[7] The funds concept is to "preserve capital and provide low risk growth" through diversification.[8] From 1982 through 2008, the fund's assets under management (AUM) were less than $50 million but they grew to $1 billion in 2007, $3.4 billion in 2008 and $5 billion in 2009.[4] As of 2012 the fund had $17 billion in assets under management[9] with 20% invested in gold bullion[10] and a "relatively high" 0.71% annual management fee.[11][12][13]
In the 1990s the fund had poor shareholder retention as it "badly trailed" most stock funds.[14] However, between Feb. 2, 2001 and February 2, 2011, the fund averaged an 11 percent annualized return in comparison to a 1.6 percent annualized return for the S&P 500 index. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37% in the financial crisis of 2008, the Permanent Portfolio fund lost 8%.[7] However, from its 1982 inception through 2010, the fund had average annual gains of 6.5% in comparison to the S&P 500 stock index's 10.6% average annual gain over the same period.[15] The 2012 book The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy discusses the funds benefits and limitations. The authors say that the fund manager's investment decisions and the costs associated with an actively managed mutual fund are a downside when compared to an index fund, but points out that the fund's management fee of 0.78% per year is below the mutual fund average.[6] According to a 2006 article in Kiplinger's personal finance magazine the fund has delivered on its goal of "long term stability with occasional market beating returns." [16]
Aggressive Growth Portfolio[edit]
The Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) is described as a "diversified, multi-cap core, U.S. equity fund" with the goal of long term appreciation.[2] In 2002 it had $24 million in assets under management and consisted of large and mid-sized companies.[3] In the ten years prior to March 2002 it ranked #34 amongst 797 other diversified mutual funds and had a stock management turnover rate of 6%.[3] During that period it never had a negative year and its average annual gain was 2% better than the S&P 500 Index. In 2002 its annual management fee was 1.29%.[3]
Other[edit]
The company also offers a Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) which it describes as a short-term U.S. Treasury bonds fund.[2] The firm's Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) is said to invest 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2]

Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment performance, current to the most recent month-end, may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. It can be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. For standardized performance, click here.
The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment companies. A hard copy may be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.
Each of the investment products or services referred to on this site may be offered only to investors residing in the United States. This site should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment products or services to investors residing outside the United States.
The information provided on this site is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to certain laws or regulations. Because of the global nature of the Internet, all persons and entities accessing this site do so on their own initiative and agree to comply with all applicable local laws and regulations.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Aggressive Growth Portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of U.S. stock market investments, in general, are declining. The Portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
Short-Term Treasury Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the Short-Term Treasury Portfolio. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
Versatile Bond Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging markets. In addition, certain investments may be illiquid and may be difficult to purchase, sell, or value. 
Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.  Earnings growth is not a measure of the Fund's future performance.
Opinions expressed and views on the securities mentioned are those of Michael J. Cuggino as of the dates provided. They are subject to change at any time, are not guaranteed, and should not be considered investment advice. References to other mutual funds or ETFs should not be considered an offer of those securities.  The hypothetical $10,000 investment made in the Portfolio on the dates noted assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charge or redemption fees.  It does not imply any future performance.
Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Fund assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.  Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.
Fund holdings can be reviewed by clicking on the following fact sheets —  Permanent Portfolio, Short-Term Treasury Portfolio, Versatile Bond Portfolio, and Aggressive Growth Portfolio. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security.
Citigroup 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index tracks the performance of U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining maturity of three months.  Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average of the stock prices of thirty large companies and represents a widely recognized unmanaged portfolio of common stocks.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index is a market-capitalization weighted index of five hundred unmanaged common stocks and is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. The Hang Seng Index is a free-float capitalization-weighted index of a selection of companies from the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.  The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is an equity valuation measure defined as market price per share divided by annual earnings per share.  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices.  National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) is a national securities exchange that is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group. The NASDAQ Stock Market is comprised of three market tiers: (1) the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (2) the NASDAQ Global Market, formerly the NASDAQ National Market, and (3) the NASDAQ Capital Market, formerly the NASDAQ SmallCap Market. For a company to trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market, it must meet the listing requirements of at least one of these three market tiers. Some of these listing requirements include meeting specified minimum thresholds for the number of publicly traded shares, total market value, stock price and number of shareholders.   The Russell 2000 Index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. The Russell 2000 Index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that index.  U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to majority of its most significant trading partners. This index is similar to other trade-weighted indexes, which also use the exchange rates from the same major currencies.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) is a price-weighted average of 20 transportation stocks traded in the U.S.  The S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index represents the homebuilding sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index.  The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index comprises those companies included in the S&P 500 that are classified as members of the GICS consumer discretionary sector.  The S&P 500 Energy Index comprises companies included in the S&P 500 that are classified as members of the energy sector as per the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).  Earnings per share (EPS) is a company’s profit divided by its number of common outstanding shares​. Indexes do not include management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Investments cannot be made directly in an index.  Beta is a measure of systematic risk or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta.  Investment in gold involves risks, such as the possibility to generate no interest or dividends, offering only the potential for price appreciation. Gold is subject to market risk and has experienced volatile fluctuations in price from time to time. The Swiss franc is subject to the risk that inflation will decrease in the U.S. or rise in Switzerland. While Switzerland has historically been a politically stable nation, Swiss government bonds are subject to some risk of default and their credit quality is not rated by certain U.S. rating agencies.  Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar investment objectives.  Alpha is the mean of the excess return of the manager over beta times benchmark. Alpha is a measure of risk (beta)-adjusted return. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.  Standard deviation measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean and is often used as a measure of risk. A large deviation implies there have been large swings in the return series of the manager.   FANG is representative of four of the most popular and best-performing tech stocks in recent memory — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL).

OVERVIEW
Objective 
                                Permanent Portfolio® seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of its shares over the long term.
Strategy
                                Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.
In pursuit of its investment objective, Permanent Portfolio invests a fixed “Target Percentage” of its net assets in each of the following investment categories:
  

Target Portfolio Structure:

  Gold
  Silver
  Swiss Franc Assets
  Real Estate and Natural Resource Stocks
  Aggressive Growth Stocks
  Dollar Assets





Reasons to Consider

1 Seeks long-term performance regardless of economic environment.
2 Non-leveraged and multi-asset class investment strategy at all times.
3 Complements global allocation or macro investment strategies with significant fixed income or equity weightings.








PERFORMANCE
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment performance, current to the most recent month-end, may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. It can be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Performance data shown with load reflects the Class A shares maximum sales charge of 5.00% and the Class C shares maximum deferred sales charge of 1.00%. Performance data shown as no load does not reflect the current maximum sales charges. Had the sales charge been included, the fund's returns would be lower. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.

Pacific Heights Asset Management, LLC became the Fund’s investment adviser on May 1, 2003. Prior to that, an investment adviser unrelated to Pacific Heights Asset Management, LLC managed the Fund.
Citigroup 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index tracks the performance of U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining maturity of three months. The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index is a market-capitalization weighted index of common stocks and represents an unmanaged portfolio of common stocks. 
 Indices are unmanaged and are not subject to fees and expenses. You cannot invest directly in an index.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible. 
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Pacific Heights Asset Management, LLC (“Pacific Heights”) is the investment adviser to Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds (“Fund”).  The Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC (“Quasar”), a member of  FINRA.  Quasar is not affiliated with Pacific Heights.

The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment companies. A hard copy may be obtained by calling (800) 531-5142. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.

Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Aggressive Growth Portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of U.S. stock market investments, in general, are declining. The Portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
Short-Term Treasury Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the Short-Term Treasury Portfolio. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
Versatile Bond Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1982 and its first offering was a mutual fund called the Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX).[2] The Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) was founded in 1987.[2] A stock fund called Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) was opened in 1990[2] and Michael Cuggino was hired to manage it.[3] In 1991, the company added the Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) which invests 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2] Cuggino, a Certified Public Accountant took control of the Permanent Portfolio fund in 2003 when his predecessor was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[2][4][5] Other company leaders include: James H. Andrews as Treasurer, Susan K. Freund as Chief Compliance Officer and Derek D. Hyatt as their Senior Investment Analyst.[2]
Products[edit]
Permanent Portfolio fund[edit]
The company's flagship fund was established in 1982 by Terry Coxan and John Chandler and "mimicked an early version of the permanent portfolio concept" of Browne.[6] According to Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine it was designed to neutralize high inflation by investing in precious metals, Swiss bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and natural resource stocks. This was similar to Browne's strategy of 25% of a portfolio in bonds, stocks, cash and gold with annual re-balancing. Browne's strategy was portrayed as a "fail-safe" investment strategy and was outlined in his 1999 book Fail-Safe Investing.[7] The Permanent Portfolio mutual fund, however, is more complex than Browne's original concept and has six asset categories.[4] The fund aims to invest in a fixed percentage of uncorrelated, asset categories to minimize risk in changing economic climates.[2] These include 35% in government bonds, 25% in gold and silver bullion, 15% in growth stocks, 10% in cash and Swiss francs and 15% in energy, mining, and real estate stocks.[7] The funds concept is to "preserve capital and provide low risk growth" through diversification.[8] From 1982 through 2008, the fund's assets under management (AUM) were less than $50 million but they grew to $1 billion in 2007, $3.4 billion in 2008 and $5 billion in 2009.[4] As of 2012 the fund had $17 billion in assets under management[9] with 20% invested in gold bullion[10] and a "relatively high" 0.71% annual management fee.[11][12][13]
In the 1990s the fund had poor shareholder retention as it "badly trailed" most stock funds.[14] However, between Feb. 2, 2001 and February 2, 2011, the fund averaged an 11 percent annualized return in comparison to a 1.6 percent annualized return for the S&P 500 index. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37% in the financial crisis of 2008, the Permanent Portfolio fund lost 8%.[7] However, from its 1982 inception through 2010, the fund had average annual gains of 6.5% in comparison to the S&P 500 stock index's 10.6% average annual gain over the same period.[15] The 2012 book The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy discusses the funds benefits and limitations. The authors say that the fund manager's investment decisions and the costs associated with an actively managed mutual fund are a downside when compared to an index fund, but points out that the fund's management fee of 0.78% per year is below the mutual fund average.[6] According to a 2006 article in Kiplinger's personal finance magazine the fund has delivered on its goal of "long term stability with occasional market beating returns." [16]
Aggressive Growth Portfolio[edit]
The Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) is described as a "diversified, multi-cap core, U.S. equity fund" with the goal of long term appreciation.[2] In 2002 it had $24 million in assets under management and consisted of large and mid-sized companies.[3] In the ten years prior to March 2002 it ranked #34 amongst 797 other diversified mutual funds and had a stock management turnover rate of 6%.[3] During that period it never had a negative year and its average annual gain was 2% better than the S&P 500 Index. In 2002 its annual management fee was 1.29%.[3]
Other[edit]
The company also offers a Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) which it describes as a short-term U.S. Treasury bonds fund.[2] The firm's Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) is said to invest 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2]

Mutual fund investing involves risk; loss of principal is possible.
Permanent Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. The fund will be affected by changes in the prices of gold, silver, Swiss franc assets and U.S. and foreign aggressive growth, real estate and natural resource stocks.  The fund is non-diversified and thus may be able to invest more of its assets in fewer issuers and types of investments than a diversified fund.   Investing a higher percentage of its assets in any one or a few issuers could increase the fund’s risk of loss and its share price volatility.  The fund may invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies.
Aggressive Growth Portfolio's stocks may appreciate in value more rapidly than the stock market, but they are also subject to greater risk, especially during periods when the prices of U.S. stock market investments, in general, are declining. The Portfolio invests in smaller companies, which will involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Portfolio also invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater   volatility, political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods.
Short-Term Treasury Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other government agency, does not guarantee an investment in the Short-Term Treasury Portfolio. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
Versatile Bond Portfolio's investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in below investment grade bonds (also referred to as “high yield” or “junk” bonds) present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in foreign securities involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater in emerging markets. In addition, certain investments may be illiquid and may be difficult to purchase, sell, or value. 
Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.  Earnings growth is not a measure of the Fund's future performance.

This was similar to Browne's strategy of 25% of a portfolio in bonds, stocks, cash and gold with annual re-balancing. Browne's strategy was portrayed as a "fail-safe" investment strategy and was outlined in his 1999 book Fail-Safe Investing.[7] The Permanent Portfolio mutual fund, however, is more complex than Browne's original concept and has six asset categories.[4] The fund aims to invest in a fixed percentage of uncorrelated, asset categories to minimize risk in changing economic climates.[2] These include 35% in government bonds, 25% in gold and silver bullion, 15% in growth stocks, 10% in cash and Swiss francs and 15% in energy, mining, and real estate stocks.[7] The funds concept is to "preserve capital and provide low risk growth" through diversification.[8] From 1982 through 2008, the fund's assets under management (AUM) were less than $50 million but they grew to $1 billion in 2007, $3.4 billion in 2008 and $5 billion in 2009.[4] As of 2012 the fund had $17 billion in assets under management[9] with 20% invested in gold bullion[10] and a "relatively high" 0.71% annual management fee.[11][12][13]
In the 1990s the fund had poor shareholder retention as it "badly trailed" most stock funds.[14] However, between Feb. 2, 2001 and February 2, 2011, the fund averaged an 11 percent annualized return in comparison to a 1.6 percent annualized return for the S&P 500 index. When the S&P 500 index dropped 37% in the financial crisis of 2008, the Permanent Portfolio fund lost 8%.[7] However, from its 1982 inception through 2010, the fund had average annual gains of 6.5% in comparison to the S&P 500 stock index's 10.6% average annual gain over the same period.[15] The 2012 book The Permanent Portfolio: Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy discusses the funds benefits and limitations. The authors say that the fund manager's investment decisions and the costs associated with an actively managed mutual fund are a downside when compared to an index fund, but points out that the fund's management fee of 0.78% per year is below the mutual fund average.[6] According to a 2006 article in Kiplinger's personal finance magazine the fund has delivered on its goal of "long term stability with occasional market beating returns." [16]
Aggressive Growth Portfolio[edit]
The Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) is described as a "diversified, multi-cap core, U.S. equity fund" with the goal of long term appreciation.[2] In 2002 it had $24 million in assets under management and consisted of large and mid-sized companies.[3] In the ten years prior to March 2002 it ranked #34 amongst 797 other diversified mutual funds and had a stock management turnover rate of 6%.[3] During that period it never had a negative year and its average annual gain was 2% better than the S&P 500 Index. In 2002 its annual management fee was 1.29%.[3]
Other[edit]
The company also offers a Short-Term Treasury Portfolio (PRTBX) which it describes as a short-term U.S. Treasury bonds fund.[2] The firm's Versatile Bond Portfolio (PRVBX) is said to invest 80% or more of its net assets in bonds.[2]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
