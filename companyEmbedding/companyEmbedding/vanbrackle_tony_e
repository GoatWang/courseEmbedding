Many of our team members have built their entire careers around serving small to midsize businesses just like yours.What We DoWe provide merchant processing solutions that are easy for our customers to use and affordable for their business, offering a combination of cutting-edge technology and best-in-class customer service.Today’s technology has come a long way in terms of helping small business owners help themselves, but what happens when you have a question and want to speak to an actual human being? At Unified Commerce, you can call our U.S.-based team anytime—and we’ll be glad you called…It’s our pleasure!Investor and Advisory Board MemberPeerAspectOctober 2016  –  Present (10 months)Baltimore, Maryland AreaWe are the creators of Sheets by PeerAspect, the world's most advanced and friendliest software for collecting and managing supply chain data.Organizations around the world are faced with an ever-growing need to collect, send and manage data. Whether it is for compliance with regulations or adherence to voluntary standards, all players in the 21st century economy increasingly deal in data. But the tools most of us have been using to collect this data are crude and ill-suited to the task. In most cases, companies create surveys in programs like Excel and Word, which they then email back and forth. This makes it difficult to track versions or have coherent conversations about the contents of the documents, leading users to waste time digging through emails for important information.Online surveys are an improvement, but they tend to lack the kinds of compliance tools needed to verify the data. (Some examples include the ability to attach documentation to specific data points, or to set automatic or manual compliance checks on individual questions or entire surveys.)Additionally, surveys are static. Once they're sent and responded to, you need to send a whole new one if you want to change or add to it - even if it means asking many of the same questions over and over again. Sheets by PeerAspect are living surveys that change as data needs evolve. For example, data collected for compliance with regulations in Europe can be applied to similar compliance programs in other countries, eliminating the need to send multiple redundant surveys to suppliers. They have built-in tracking and communications tools, meaning you'll stop spending time searching through emails and folders for the information you need, and instead put it to work for you - the very reason you collect it in the first place!Sheets are easy and fun to use, secure, and save our clients time and money. Contact us for a demo - you won't believe you lived without them!Investor and Board MemberHarmoney LtdMarch 2016  –  Present (1 year 5 months)harMoney is a inteligent financial management platform with interactive machine learning designed for banks to allow their customers to not only access all their financial accounts (Savings, checking, retirement & mobile payment accounts, brokerage, credit cards, etc.) in one location, stationary or mobile, but also the ability to take action in any of their accounts, regardless of who they are with.Mission: Empower customers to visualize, plan, and act on their financial goals.Investor & Board MemberHypur Inc.September 2015  –  Present (1 year 11 months)Hypur ComplyHypur Comply is a next generation bank compliance platform enabling banks to leverage technology to intelligently manage risk and confidently serve their customers.Hypur Comply offers an unmatched level of fraud monitoring and regulatory Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance.Bank Compliance for a Changing WorldRegulators are requiring banks to maintain ever higher levels of monitoring and transparency.

We find startups that may have incredible potential, perform complete due diligence, and enable our investors to purchase an equity stake in these companies with online investments. But that is where the similarities end.What makes MicroVentures different is that we are a full service online platform for venture capital investments that is open to the public. We take the best parts of Venture Capital (connections, research, deal flow, mentoring, money management) and combine it with the best aspects of Equity Crowdfunding (open access, ease of use, diversification) to give investors the best of both worlds.Gone are the days when you needed a personal invitation from a friend just for the chance to risk $100,000, at a minimum, on a single deal. MicroVentures has turned that model on its head. We match startups seeking capital with angel investors looking to invest as little as $3,000. And as a FINRA-registered broker-dealer, we are there to assist you every step of the way through the startup investing process.- See more at: https://microventures.com/#sthash.O9ZofDp0.dpufInvestor & Board MemberCardFlightNovember 2011  –  Present (5 years 9 months)The Leaders in Mobile Payments EnablementCardFlight is a provider of mobile POS technology and tools to help anyone accept card present payments in any mobile app with virtually any merchant account.

We Understand MobileCardFlight started when we were trying to build a mobile app that would use a magnetic stripe reader to read credit card data, and we quickly realized the existing options were difficult to use. Hardware-level integrations, designing custom encryption processes, working with credit card data in a PCI-compliant manner, integrating legacy XML SDKs with frustrating documentation, and so on… There needed to be an easier way to integrate mobile payments for real world commerce. It didn’t exist in the market, so we decided to build it.

Most investments today target speculative returns, with uncertain levels of risk, over an uncertain period of time. While opportunistic, this approach to investing brings a high degree of uncertainty. Outcome based investing encourages targeting a specific defined return or “payoff”, with an allowance for a specific defined risk, at a specific point in time in the future.Vest Financial was acquired by Chicago Options Board Exchange "COBE" January of 2016.ChairmanElectronic Check Alliance ProcessingJuly 2008  –  August 2011 (3 years 2 months)Greater Minneapolis-St. Paul AreaElectronic Check Alliance Processing Inc. provides commerce solutions for electronic check processing and software applications.

				How To Use				


The following pictures will give you a visual                            of how easy the E-Z Out-Rodder is to use:





Step 1: Place the Marked (Port) / Starboard) E-Z Outrodder in the gunwale mount rodholder.





Step 2: Place  fishing rod in the E-Z Outrodder and lock in gimble. (You should always  use a safety line at least 6 feet in length from your reel to your  cleat.) DO NOT USE a  tight drag. it can ruin your                               gimble pin  in your flush mounted rod holder and or                                damage your locking cut on your E-Z Out-Rodder.





Step 3: When a fish is hooked, grab your rod and pull gently toward  you and release the pin.
DO NOT USE THE RELEASE PIN WHEN  USING WIRE LINE OR                               DEEP LURE TROLLING, IT  IS USED ONLY WHEN FISHING                               SURFACE  LURES IF MAKING SHARP TURNS.
DO NOT STORE YOUR OUTRODDER WITH THE RELEASE PIN  IN.





EzOutrodder Is not responsible for any damage if these instructions are not followed


Step 4: Lift the rod and E-Z Outrodder to a vertical position.

  



Step 5: Lift the rod out of the E-Z Outrodder with a slight pull  towards you and reel in the fish.

About










Achievements






Helped build a small business with six employees to a public company with 1,600 employees that sold for $1.3 Billion dollars in less than 12 years. Then started a new company, built it to over 100 employees and sold it to a leading industry player. In both cases, created industry leading sales and marketing teams with a focus on the employees driving the growth and management supporting the employees. It's always about the people, not the management or technology.
