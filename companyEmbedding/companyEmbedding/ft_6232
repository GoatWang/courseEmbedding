Thank you for your feedback.
If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Hand ToolsThere are situations and jobs that lend themselves to plugging in a power tool, but then there are those situations and jobs that demand a little more concentration and fine workmanship, those moments where you need to be able to have more feel for what you're doing, and those activities where you can't be lugging around heavy machinery, not to mention an extension cord or battery pack. At these times, having the right hand tool near at hand makes all the difference.

When it comes to precise equipment that doesn't have an outside power source, Amazon.com's Hand Tools Store offers a vast selection. If looking for a stud or doing other testing, there are electrical testers, multi testers, stud finders, moisture meters, and distance estimators that can save you time as well as chalk lines, line lasers, levels, marking tools, measuring wheels, rulers, and tape measures to promote accuracy. There is also an incredible assortment of clamps to keep materials and more in place: angle clamps, bar and pipe clamps, C-clamps, edge clamps, spreader clamps, spring clamps, and vertical glue-press clamps.

Hand tools are essential if you enjoy outdoor adventuring, too (even if the outdoors is only the forest in your backyard), with multitools and multitool accessories and folded knives, fixed blade knives, utility knives, blades, knife sets, and flashlights to keep the wild from getting worrisome. Don't forget the classic hand tools, either, the chisels, hammers, pliers, screwdrivers, sockets and socket sets, tool sets, tool bags, and wrenches that form the crucial core of any tool collection.

These hand tools, both contemporary and classic, share a certain trait. The best hand tools are made by the best brands, dependable brands such as Black & Decker, Bessey, Bucket Boss, Dorcy, Fluke, Gear Wrench, Gerber Bear Grylls Knives, Irwin, Klein, Leatherman, MagLite, SOG Specialty Knives, Smith & Wesson, Stanley, Streamlight, and Wenger Swiss Army Knives. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. With good hand tools, you're prepared for any task.

 Deep Cut Portable Band Saw, Variable Speeds, 380 Surface Ft. per Min. High is rated    4.0 out of    5 by    3.               Rated 4 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        Great band saw Great to cut on all threads & uni- strut channels. Also bigger size conduits make a straight. Date published: 2015-11-18                 Rated 3 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        Good but a bit limited Love the power and the built quality however: Two points. 1) It really should come with a blade (Honestly, it doesn not ship with one? It's not like its a cheap saw.) More important 2) This is no light tool. Like virtually all portable bandsaws it really needs a support option to make anything other than occasional, inaccurate cuts. No fun discovering long after the purchase that there is no such option. Date published: 2014-05-18                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        The Perfect Tool Avid fabricator in a small workshop, this is the handiest tool ever. Built a stationary stand for it and use it every day. Low noise, no sparks and excellent control. This has my plasma cutter, chop saw and grinder zip discs beat all to hell. Wish I had tried one years ago. I understand why it didn't come with a blade, just wish you could buy a variety 3 pack of blades to try out on various materials. My 18 tpi seems to do it all.
