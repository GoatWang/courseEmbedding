S&P 500 Index
                


The S&P 500® Index is composed of five hundred (500) selected stocks, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans over 25 separate industry groups.














Important Risk Information
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
Passively managed funds invest by sampling the index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.
Companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations. In exchange for this potentially lower risk, the value of the security may not rise as much as companies with smaller market capitalizations.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.
