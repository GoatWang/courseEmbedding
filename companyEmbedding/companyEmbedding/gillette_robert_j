First Solar Has A New CEO, Robert J. Gillette

First Solar has announced its new CEO will be Robert Gillette, former CEO of Honeywell Aerospace. He starts October 1st, taking over for departing CEO Michael Ahearn. 
Ahearn announced he was stepping down in April, saying, "We are rapidly reaching the point where the evolution of the energy industry will be constrained not by technology or product costs, but rather by policies, programs and institutions that cannot adapt rapidly to the innovations that are occurring in clean energy.” 
Gillette comes in at a rather bad time. Polysilicon prices have been falling, putting a lot of pressure on First Solar who makes their thin film panels out of cadmium telluride. Analysts have been saying all year that First Solar is going to face serious competition, and most think the stock is overpriced.
The solar industry at large faces serious headwinds. There is an oversupply of panels, and prices are expected to fall well into 2010, squeezing margins.
If those troubles weren't enough, Ahern's excellent tenure at First Solar makes the job difficult for anyone to follow. Under Ahearn's watch, the company beat Wall Street's estimates quarter after quarter.

Press Release:
TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 3, 2009--       First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq:FSLR) today announced that Robert J. Gillette       has been appointed chief executive officer, succeeding Mike Ahearn.
Mr. Gillette brings a wealth of experience to this position, having       spent the last four and a half years as the CEO and president of       Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell International’s most profitable business       group with current sales of more than $12 billion annually. In this       role, he led more than 40,000 associates at nearly 100 worldwide       manufacturing and service sites.
In welcoming Mr. Gillette to First Solar, Mr. Ahearn said, “I compliment       the Board of Directors and the search committee for identifying and       bringing to First Solar an executive possessing a unique combination of       skills and experiences that make him an ideal leader for First Solar in       the next wave of our growth.”
Mr. Gillette joined Honeywell in 1996 and has served in a number of       senior management positions, including president and CEO of Honeywell       Transportation Systems and president of Honeywell Turbo Technologies.       Prior to joining Honeywell, Mr. Gillette spent over 10 years at General       Electric where he served in numerous senior management positions.
“Rob has a track record of fostering innovation and bringing new       technologies and products to market. He has built organizational       capability to enable businesses to scale in complex and geographically       diverse markets and he has worked extensively in global markets,       including Europe, Asia and South America,” said Mr. Ahearn. “He has       demonstrated a leadership style that meshes well with our core values       and will enable him to form strong working relationships with our       management team.”
“This is a unique opportunity to join a leader in what promises to be       one of the most important industries of the 21st century,”       said Mr. Gillette. “I am excited to lead First Solar through the next       phase of its growth.”
Mr. Gillette will assume his duties as CEO and join the Board of       Directors effective October 1, 2009. As previously announced, Mr. Ahearn       will continue to serve in the full-time position of executive chairman.

Robert Gillette: Making ’em fly at Honeywell Aerospace
April 23, 2008
Imagine taking a dozen related but independently-run businesses, each with its own unique product, merging them into a cohesive business segment within an enormous corporation and driving up sales roughly 30 percent — all during an intense, three-and-a-half year period. This is the high-performance world of Robert J. Gillette, Arizona-based president and chief executive officer of Honeywell Aerospace. "We turned our business upside down, changing everything, including how we go to market. It was a relatively painful process," Gillette told a ballroom of business leaders attending a recent Economic Club of Phoenix luncheon.

Imagine taking a dozen related but independently-run businesses, each with its own unique product, merging them into a cohesive business segment within an enormous corporation and driving up sales roughly 30 percent — all during an intense, three-and-a-half year period.
This is the high-performance world of Robert J. Gillette, Arizona-based president and chief executive officer of Honeywell Aerospace, the $13 billion behemoth that advertises with the catchy “we make ’em fly” slogan. His segment, Aerospace, produces integrated avionics, engines, equipment, systems and services, for everything from small jets to government missiles. It has more than 20 production or service sites in the U.S., United Kingdom and Europe.
“We turned our business upside down, changing everything, including how we go to market. It was a relatively painful process,” Gillette told a ballroom of business leaders attending an Economic Club of Phoenix luncheon. Held at the JW Marriott Camelback Inn on April 17, the gathering drew more than 200 participants.
“But we had to put our customer first if we were going to win new business in the future to do a good job for them every day, and deliver on commitments made. That had not always been the case,” he continued.
Sales in the wind
Aerospace is a heavy hitter for Honeywell, responsible for roughly a third — $12.2 billion — of its overall $34.6 billion in sales last year. The only segment that out-produced Aerospace was Automation and Control Solutions, source of $12.5 billion in 2007 sales. Transportation Systems produced $5 billion, while Specialty Materials pulled in $4.9 billion.
Locally, Honeywell is a major presence, with 12,500 Arizona employees and 9,600 retirees. Approximately half of that workforce holds a bachelor’s or an advanced degree, and the average salary is a comfortable $68,000. The corporation’s impact also is felt in the supply stream, contracting with 1,300 suppliers in Arizona. Statewide, Honeywell’s payroll is more than $1 billion, and the company’s spending puts another $471 million annually into Arizona’s economy. Add to that educational contributions topping $500,000, and it’s clear that Honeywell’s Arizona footprint is huge.
Flying the not-so-friendly skies
But back when Gillette took over Aerospace in 2005, many of the airlines that make up Honeywell Aerospace’s commercial customer base were still suffering the after-shock of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Even worse, customers across the board, including military and private customers, were dissatisfied with service. Complaints included slow response times, a baffling bureaucracy and clueless sales/service employees who didn’t have the necessary technical expertise.
Gillette initially came on board in 1996. In mid-2001, he was named president and CEO of Honeywell Transportation Systems. With him at the helm, Transportation sales grew 8 percent, while income leapt 22 percent. At Aerospace, he had a simple mandate: dominate the defense market and reinvigorate the commercial sector.
He identified five trends that Aerospace hopes to cash in on — flight efficiency, after-market outsourcing, changes among competitors as well as business models, growing global demand and an increasing defense budget.
Blind sight
For each trend, Aerospace came up with a strategy to exploit it, and leveraged products by adding services. An example is a just-approved system for “flying blind” in zero visibility. Gillette called the new technology “synthetic vision that gives pilots a computer-generated three-dimensional look at what is in front of the plane.” The military likely will use it on helicopters that otherwise are grounded due to sandstorms, he noted.
Aerospace is pouring considerable resources into its flying-blind solution, which promises to save “incredible amounts of fuel while saving on CO2 emissions” because it allows airplanes to fly point-to-point. “We no longer will have to fly highways in the sky,” Gillette added.
Customers have responded to the new energy and better service by signing on the dotted line. Recent deals include an $18 billion, 30-year contract with Airbus, a $3 billion deal with Gulfstream and another $23 million gig with a Brazilian manufacturer of business jets, he said.
The fast-changing global market
Gillette says global expansion indicates that Honeywell Aerospace’s market may change faster than domestic demands. For instance, 10 years ago, 70 percent of all business jets sold worldwide were sold in North America; today, only 40-50 percent of that business stems from North American customers, he explained. “This changes our business dynamic, as we must supply customers where they fly,” he added. Another strategy is figuring out which tasks Aerospace can perform for the customer that the company currently struggles with internally.
Then there’s the diverse technology underlying Aerospace’s performance. Air transport claims 60+ platforms; regional transport, 35+ platforms, business jets, approximately 120 platforms; general aviation, 100+ platforms and helicopters, 20+ platforms. And those are just the commercial platforms.
Teamwork
Despite the incredibly successful reorganization, Gillette says his “biggest challenge and most rewarding experience” remains delivering on the company’s customer commitments. Key to that is a cohesive team of “really, really good people,” he noted.
“I don’t do a hell of a lot. Mainly, I select people, put them in the right positions and roles, listen to them, and alleviate what gets in their way. When I go home at night or get on a plane to fly somewhere else, I hope they come up with something good,” he told the lunch crowd.
While developing leaders internally is a favorite focus, Gillette admits that business executives’ lectures on personal leadership can be “a bit of a clich .” His approach is to spend time and energy talking to employees about the company’s goals and direction. The opposite of a leader is a victim, and victimhood isn’t welcome at Honeywell Aerospace. “Some don’t want to take responsibility. Honeywell people do, and it’s the reason for our success.” He said. “It’s not a bleeding-heart, Kumbaya kind of thing; it’s just the truth. Focus on customers, deliver on commitments and when something happens, fix it.”
Bottom Line:

More than 2,000 graduates of Arizona State University work at Honeywell Aerospace, according to Gillette.
While Aerospace is based in Phoenix, Ariz., parent company Honeywell is headquartered in Morris Township, N.J. Honeywell is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average and is also a component of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Aerospace accounts for roughly a third — $12.2 billion — of its overall $34.6 billion in sales last year.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
