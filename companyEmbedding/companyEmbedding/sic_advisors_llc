1) Offering price subject to change. Reliance should only be made on the offering price as stated in the current prospectus, as amended and supplemented.
2) There can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level. Represents annualized disÂ­tributions. All distributions are subject to board approval. Sierra's previous distributions to stockholders were funded from expense support payments that are subject to repayment to its investment adviser, SIC Advisors LLC ("SIC Advisors"). The level of these distributions was not based on our investment performance and may not continue in the future. If SIC Advisors had not agreed to make expense support payments, these distributions would have come from paid in capital. The reimbursement of these payments owed to SIC Advisors will reduce the future distributions to which investors would otherwise be entitled.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
        






 





 Investments are not FDIC insured, may lose value, are not a deposit, are not bank guaranteed and are not insured by any Federal government agency.
      *Information concerning  portfolio holdings and industry/sector concentration is as of the date indicated and based on principal amount. Portfolios are subject to change, and accordingly, there can be no assurance that Sierra Income Corporation will continue to hold positions in the companies identified above or with the diversification set forth above. While Sierra Income Corporation seeks to diversify its holdings across industries, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. Diversification neither guarantees a profit nor protects against losses. Investments illustrated do not include cash balances or money market investments.**Holdings in US Treasuries are short term in nature and used to meet the needs of certain diversification requirements. The total investment amount in US Treasures is dynamic and will vary on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, the yield on current investments in cash or cash equivilents is not included in the Weighted Average Gross Yield.
*** Each floating rate loan uses LIBOR or ABR (Alternate Base Rate) as its floating rate index.  Please refer to the SEC filing section of our website for more detailed information. Interest rates on individual investments are not necessarily reflective of distributions to investors.  Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of any distributions is uncertain.  In addition, distribution proceeds may exceed earnings, particularly during the period before the manager has substantially invested the net proceeds from the offering.  Consequently, distributions, if any, may represent a return of capital.

Sierra Income Corporation





























RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative. You should carefully consider the
            information found in "Risk Factors" before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. Risks involved in an investment in us include
            (among others) the following: (1) We are a new company and have no operating history. In addition, we have not identified specific
            investments that we will make with the proceeds of this offering. As a result, this offering may be deemed to be a "blind pool" offering and you
            will not have the opportunity to evaluate historical data or assess any investments prior to purchasing shares of our common stock. (2)
            Economic activity in the United States was impacted by the global financial crisis of 2008 and has yet to fully recover. These conditions may
            make it more difficult for us to achieve our investment objectives. (3) Our shares will not be listed on a national securities exchange for the
            foreseeable future, which means there will be no public market for our securities during the offering period. You will have limited ability to
            sell your shares. (4) There are substantial conflicts among the interests of our investors, our interests and the interests of our advisor, dealer
            manager and our respective affiliates regarding compensation, investment opportunities and management resources. (5) Our board of
            directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse
            to stockholders. (6) Our dealer manager also serves as the dealer manager for the distribution of securities of other issuers, and may
            experience conflicts of interest as a result. (7) While we intend to repurchase a limited number of our common stock pursuant to our share
            repurchase program beginning with the first calendar quarter following the one-year anniversary of achieving the minimum offering
            requirement, we may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. (8) Our investment in prospective portfolio companies
            may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment. (9) The amount of any distributions we may make is uncertain. Our distribution
            proceeds may exceed our earnings, particularly during the period before we have substantially invested the net proceeds from this offering.
            Therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may represent a return of capital to you for tax purposes. (10) We intend to qualify as a
            RIC but may fail to do so. Such failure would subject us to federal income tax on all of our income, which would have a material adverse effect
            on our financial performance. (11) A significant portion of our portfolio will be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board
            of directors and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. (12) We have not established any limit on
            the extent to which we may use borrowings, our equity capital, or proceeds from this offering to fund distributions to stockholders, which may
            reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain distributions at any
            particular level. Our distributions may exceed our earnings, which we refer to as a return of capital, particularly during the period before we
            have substantially invested the net proceeds from this offering, which may result in commensurate reductions in net asset value per share.
            Accordingly, stockholders who receive the payment of a dividend or other distribution from us should not assume that such dividend or other
            distribution is the result of a net profit earned by us. (13) This is a "best efforts" offering and, if we are unable to raise substantial funds then
            we will be more limited in the number and type of investments we may make. As a result, our ability to diversify will be constrained. (14) Our
            investments may include original issue discount instruments. To the extent original issue discount constitutes a portion of our income, we will
            be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of
        cash representing such income.
