 Schwarz-Bart, Levinas, and Post-Shoah–Postcolonial Gendered Ethics
      
      

Neil R. Davison


From:  
          MFS Modern Fiction StudiesVolume 60, Number 4, Winter 2014

          pp. 767-795 | 10.1353/mfs.2014.0048




Abstract
Abstract:
	  This article examines the influence of Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy on the ethical aspects of the life and work of André Schwarz-Bart. The essay is framed through recent re-interest in Schwarz-Bart’s collaborative works with his wife, Simone, as a bridge between Holocaust and postcolonial studies. The publications, arguments, and key points of intersubjective ethics in Levinas’s work that Schwarz-Bart encountered are carefully examined. The argument confronts the critical reception of Levinas’s concepts of the feminine and dwelling to demonstrate how, when seen through a Judaic lens, these notions form a new gendered reading of Schwarz-Bart’s The Last of the Just.

Review 
When it came time for this talented, eclectic tenor man -- a native of Guadeloupe whose parents, both award-winning authors, are a black Guadeloupean mother and a Holocaust-surviving French Jewish father -- to record his solo projects, he had a wide variety of stylistic directions to choose from. He's been in many bands with jazz superstar Roy Hargrove, including Crisol, and his extensive touring with neo-soul god D'Angelo led him to work with David Gilmore and Me'Shell NdegéOcello. But rather than draw on these professional influences, Jacques Schwarz-Bart digs straight to his roots, blending the traditional gwoka rhythms of Guadeloupe with the jazz, gospel, and soul he absorbed during a lifetime spent everywhere from the Caribbean to Western Europe and the U.S. His tenor playing is inventive and colorful, his improvisations stellar throughout, and he blends beautifully with the dense African percussion, rolling rhythms, and light female and huskier male native choirs. The musician's intention, however, is to tell a rhythmic and melodic story of the history of many styles, fusing into a contemporary narrative in a wide array of moods and modes. The result is an exhilarating, hard to classify Afro-jazz delight that defies all genre specifics but fits cozily into both jazz and world music bins. His story begins with the infectious clapping rhythms of "Papale," built on the insistent war rhythm known as mende, with Schwarz-Bart's sizzling sax played with an otherworldly wah-wah pedal. It's an odd but enticing beginning because it's like no other sax sound you've ever heard. On the title track, he plays brightly textured horn lines over more clapping, subtle tribal vocals, and densely rhythmic acoustic guitar lines. The wistful "Love" shows off the more gentle side of Schwarz-Bart's artistry, as he combines woule rhythms with a wordless Brazilian vocal by Stephanie McKay and a graceful jazz piano solo by Milan Milanovic. This sort of jazz-meets-African vibe, colored with unexpected exotic elements, runs all the way through the mix -- with a warm, tropical stop on the "Descent" -- to the unusually toned closer "Lewoz," an odd-metered track based on the rhythm of the dead that blends woodwind and trumpet in a dance simulating the interaction between heaven and earth. As Schwarz-Bart follows his own multicultural muse, fans of progressive jazz and various world grooves will enjoy the journey the most. ~ Jonathan Widran, Rovi

Top positive reviewSee all 60 positive reviews› 5.0 out of 5 stars"And praised be the Lord."ByTrad Cappon January 16, 2017A beautifully woven story about a family of Just Men.  I wasn't aware of the Talmudic tradition of the "Lamed-Vov," which is portrayed in a fictional, though no less mysterious and sacred, account of the men of the Levy family.  We learn of the history of the family, its traditions and its colorful characters in their eastern European beginnings, as they migrate westward into Germany for economic opportunity, and further, harsher journeys eastward by necessity and force.The characters made an indelible mark--I smiled at their eccentricities, the beauty in their flaws. Their strength in faith in the face of atrocity moved me to tears.  I heard about this book on Dennis Prager's radio show...he made a passing comment, but something made me write the title down.  I'm so glad I did, for it's a book that will forever remain etched in the moral part of my brain, and the innermost confines of my heart.  It's a rare book that I've finished and felt changed...this is such a book.The Kindle edition (as I purchased) has a few flaws--some inconsistencies in casing most often. The most confusing (but still discernible) error is that of the female name "Ilse" which distorts to "Use" at some points in the text. E-books can be buggy, but it hardly mars this story.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 stars"there is no room for truth here" p.376ByAna'FichesdeLectureson August 17, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI just finished reading this beautiful novel, crying and I am once reminded how almost impossible is to accept, understand, grasp : yes, indeed, an Holocaust occurred in our mist.I discovered this novel through an Holocaust online class offered by Coursera.org (can't recommend it enough!).This is a very unique novel enrapt of figurative narrative giving a tribute to the victims of the Holocaust.How did the author accomplish such mission? By sharing the legacy of a Jewish family, the Levys, from the 12th Century up the end of WWII. Through the epic story of their ancestors, the author clearly portrays the Jewish culture, their customs, their beliefs and what they go through up until the Holocaust. We witness how the Levy family suffers through several persecutions (pogroms from Eastern Russia, Poland, Germany); the injustices of antisemitics agenda, the involvement of the Hitler Youth group in the school system and so on. But most importantly, what makes this novel a piece of art of its own, is the quest to determine the reasons of the Jews' fate. Why do the Jews have to suffer all these misfortunes? Why the hate? Why the Holocaust? I don't want to state the reasons here, you have to read this novel to discover them.Reading this novel to me, was like listening to a symphony full of beauty, strong feelings, sensing the suffering yet being a song from the soul of human heart.I can't recommend this novel enough. Be open-minded, it's a unique novel. Give it a try.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent BookByDumpster Divaon January 27, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI purchased the book from a very fine seller.  The book arrived in better than expected condition.  Sadly, a number of the last pages were missing.  The seller told me they wanted to refund my money so that was good of them.As for the content, it was excellent.  I wish I could have read this book in the original Yiddish but as my Yiddish is nearly non-existent, I was happy for the fine English translation.As usual, with books that have to do with the Pogroms and the Shoah, it never ceases to shock me at how many times the Jews (and others) are run out, rounded up, arrested, murdered or accused of crimes they did not commit.  Their children are bullied by school mates and also by the authorities that they should be able to trust.  This book was no different.  I am happy that I read this fine work and would encourage people who enjoy a well-written novel to make the purchase.22 comments|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsI can see why this is considered a classic.ByMarilyn Sullivanon November 6, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseIt's hard to say I "liked" this book. It was a painful read at times. I did find the translation left something to be desired, but overall the translator had a difficult task. There were times I wanted to give up. It's not like I didn't know how the book would end. What made this book different from other holocaust literature was that it focused on the lead-up to the Nazi regime, and it increased my understanding of what a Jew in that era might have experienced, long before entering an extermination camp. I would imagine that in 2016 this book is not attracting a lot of readers, but I'm sure in its time it was eye-opening.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

It was the first book about the holocaust I was exposed to, and i remember saying to myself 'this is too horrible for anyone to endure, and how could such a thing happen?"A few years later, I re-read it, and it the same emotions came flooding back to me.I have suggested to my friends who are not familiar with this book or it's author, to read it.My oldest son had never heard of  Andre Schwarz-Bart, or the book, so I ordered this copy for him. He read it, and was moved deeply. I keep my original hard copy in my home library, and plan on re-reading it for the third time.It is simply brilliant, and very emotional.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAn inspiring and emotive story!ByJ. Alvarezon April 20, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseWhile reading Chapter 1, I kept thinking, "Well, this is an odd book." I had trouble getting into the "different" tone and flow of the translator's words. At one point, I even considered not finishing the book; however, I persevered and I am so glad that I did!  By the time I had finished Chapter 2, I could hardly put the book down.  It is beautifully written!  I am 63 years old and have been interested in the Holocaust since childhood. "The Last of the Just" relates the story of Ernie Levy, the last Just Man, but also the tale of all members of the Jewish faith.  This book IS different, but in a good way.  It will squeeze the tears from your heart and soul.  This book is not for children, but I strongly recommend it to all young adults and adults.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

This is one of the finest written books I have read. It is well written and evocative. At times the book is most painful to read but it certainly captures the ongoing horror over the centuries of being Jewish and the scapegoat of many cultures. I would recomend it to anyone who is interested in the life of Jews in Eastern Europe.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsShould be required reading for all from young adults to seniors, lest we forget.ByKaren  Lehneron February 14, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book is long, and can be very hard to read, but I have read it four or five times now; each new reading brings something that I didn't see before, or I understand it in a different way.  Of all the books with the Holocaust as the central theme tht I have read, this one stands  out as almost unique; it's hard to compare it to any other book, but I have recommended it to so many people I have lost count, since I first read it when my husband lent me his copy, which he had when I met him in 1969.  , It isn't for the faint of heart, but real books about real people going through literally hell are rarely easy to read.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsJewish sufferingByNancy Lewison August 29, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseGives one insight into the reasons for Jewish non-violence in the face of the Holocaust.  Also provides understanding of Jewish beliefs that the innocent never suffer due to the presence of 36 just men in the world at all times, though a reader concludes that the title of the book stems from the author's perception that Ernie Levy, the protagonist, was the last of the just men, that the horrors of the Holocaust led inextricably to a Jewish state that would be prepared to defend itself.0Comment|

United Arab Emirates and UNICEF:  Mr. Schwartz was selected by the United Arab Emirates to Monitor four treaties to repatriate and compensate boys who were trafficked from Bangladesh, Mauritania, Pakistan and Sudan to the UAE to be camel jockeys.  He worked in each country and set up tribunals in each which operated under rules of practice which he wrote and developed.  He trained the hearing officers in special sessions in Abu Dhabi and, under directions from the Ministry of the Interior of the UAE, he met with and reported to the United States Department of State on the progress of the project.  Throughout the engagement he also worked with UNICEF, local Imams, government officials and community leaders.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA):  In 2003 and 2004, Mr. Schwartz conducted a wide-ranging review of the MTA’s integrity, compliance and procurement policies and practices.  This was not an investigation of particular conduct, but instead a self-imposed review by the MTA to strengthen its governance practices.  Mr. Schwartz worked closely with the most senior staff of the MTA and each of its agencies and the MTA Inspector General and Auditor General.  Work included auditing, interviewing, examining systems of other agencies and the private sector, revising procedures and policies and writing new ones, and streamlining and strengthening certain lines of report.  In the end, a report was delivered to the Board of the MTA at a well attended public meeting on January 29, 2004. Recommendations included changes in the enforcement of the Minority Hiring programs, purchasing improvements, changes in the bid process and the creation of a vehicle to enhance cooperation among the agencies within the MTA.  At Mr. Schwartz’s recommendation, the MTA created two new high level headquarters positions ­– Chief of Procurement and Chief of Integrity.



Construction Firm, New York: In August, 2008, selected as Minority/Women Business Enterprise (“M/WBE”) monitor for a New York based construction company.  Created an MWBE program for the firm including drafting the program’s policy documents, designing protocols for the recruitment and selection of MWBE certified vendors and advising on implementation.



US Subsidiary of an International Corporation: In 2008 drafted M/WBE guidelines and created an M/WBE plan for an international corporation’s US subsidiary.



Simpson & Brown:  In 2004, Mr. Schwartz was selected by the New York City Department of Investigation as a twenty-four month IPSIG for Simpson & Brown, a marine construction firm.  He was asked to establish a compliance program and monitor all activities of Simpson & Brown by reviewing and analyzing all books, records, computer files and documents created in the course of the firm’s business and to monitor and investigate the operations and conduct of all Simpson Brown personnel.  He implemented a strict compliance program, ethics guidelines and a hotline number. Simpson & Brown was able to recently bid on a new Port Authority contract based upon the successful monitoring program.



Durable Medical Equipment Provider: Mr. Schwartz was appointed by the federal government to operate and liquidate a business.  He succeeded in stabilizing the business and then selling it.



Hirsch Weinig:  When the government indicted the two main partners of this law firm for money laundering and drug-related crimes, Mr. Schwartz was asked by the authorities to monitor the search to ensure that innocent clients and lawyers in the firm were protected.  He also became the de facto Trustee of the firm and oversaw its financial dissolution, including paying off debts, collecting receivables, negotiating out of a substantial lease, etc.



New York City Department of Buildings (DOB):  After a major corruption scandal, Mr. Schwartz was appointed by Mayor Giuliani as the unpaid head of a blue ribbon task force to conduct a top-to-bottom management review of the DOB, including a look at its integrity-related programs.  In connection with that assignment, Mr. Schwartz chaired public hearings and oversaw the submission of a final report, which made far reaching recommendations for management changes at the DOB.  Mr. Schwartz was the only non-City member of this task force, which was comprised primarily of senior New York City officials.



Downe:  Selected by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s New York Office with the agreement of defense counsel in this major insider trading case to husband the assets of Mr. Downe and to resolve various disputes between the parties as to the interpretation of their settlement agreement.



World Trade Center:  When Mr. Schwartz was CEO of Decision Strategies he organized a team for FEMA and NYC to monitor the conduct of companies hired by the authorities to clean up one quadrant of the World Trade Center site.  This engagement resulted in a net savings to the City.



Pharmaceutical Company:   A major pharmaceutical company recently asked Mr. Schwartz to review its extensive investigative program in connection with a broad range of litigation.  Mr. Schwartz analyzed the program and completely overhauled it.  He made significant process changes and established new protocols for the lawyers and investigators.  His work resulted in a drastic reduction in costs and more effective pre-trial preparation.  He accomplished this without diminishing the spirit or morale of the lawyers or investigators.



Miami Heat Arena: While at Decision Strategies, Mr. Schwartz had responsibility for Monitoring the construction of the basketball arena in Miami for the County.  Although the arena was privately funded, the County was responsible for maintenance and had an obvious interest in ensuring quality construction, compliance with environmental laws and the honest delivery of products and services.  A multidisciplinary team worked with the construction manager and County officials, including participation in construction meetings as well as private briefings and reports for the client.



Quadrozzi: Mr. Schwartz monitored the conduct of a concrete company and eventually uncovered a scheme which was reported to the United States Attorney’s office for appropriate action.



Chiarella:  Appointed by the court upon the recommendation of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney’s Office and defense counsel to administer the pay-out fund in this groundbreaking insider trading criminal prosecution.  Mr. Schwartz identified claimants through advertising and other means, established criteria and deadlines for claims to be made and paid the claims.  During the course of this engagement Mr. Schwartz concluded that the Court Order too narrowly defined the claimant pool and he sought and obtained a modification of the Order to expand the claimant pool.



Confidential:  In this matter Mr. Schwartz served as the IPSIG over a manufacturing company and also administered a bank account funded by the monitored company for the purpose of financially supporting an undercover operation of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.



Harlem Boys Choir:   Assisted the NYC Department of Education pro bono when governance issues arose.
