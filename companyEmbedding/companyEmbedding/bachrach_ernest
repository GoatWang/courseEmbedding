Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Bunge lays out case for independence in restructuring
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    4:36 PM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


Global grain trader Bunge Ltd.'s (BG) cost cutting and restructuring plans could buy it time in the face of a takeover bid from a larger rival as it struggles to stay independent during a slump in the commodities market, analysts said. The moves seek to reduce overhead costs by $250 million by the end of 2019.

















                                                    Bunge overhaul is latest shake-up for struggling grain sector
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    10:53 PM ET 07/19/2017
                                                


Global grain trader Bunge Ltd's (BG) sweeping plans to overhaul its business and cut costs may not be enough to compensate for weak earnings and could still leave it vulnerable to a new bid from diversified rival Glencore PLC.

















                                                    Bunge cutting costs, restructuring as grains glut stings
