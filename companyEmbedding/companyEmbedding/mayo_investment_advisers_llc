It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Included Documents
Registration Filings
 


 
FINRA Entitlement
In order to file a registered investment adviser application with the appropriate regulatory jurisdiction, one must first apply to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for an account (Entitlement) to their WebCRD/IARD on-line system (the web application for the registration of RIA firms and their representatives). While RIA firms are in no way regulated or supervised by FINRA, the states and the SEC use FINRA’s WebCRD/IARD system to process applications. RIA in a Box will complete the appropriate Entitlement forms, submit, monitor, and establish the appropriate user permissions (Entitlements) to the account.
 
ADV Part 1 (online)
The Form ADV Part 1 is the on-line component of your Firm’s registration documentation. The Form ADV Part 1 primarily discloses information about the firm. Individual information is primarily disclosed in the Form U4 as detailed below. The Form ADV Part 1 is also the vehicle to upload your Firm’s Form ADV Part 2A (Firm Brochure) and Form ADV Part 2Bs (Brochure Supplements). RIA in a Box will complete the on-line Form ADV Part 1 and accompanying Schedules: A (Ownership Information); B (Indirect Ownership Information); D (Detailed information for Form ADV Part 1 disclosures including: Private Fund, Branch Office, and Affiliation Information disclosures), Form ADV Part 1B (Additional required information for state-registered firms); and also upload the Form ADV Part 2A and the Form ADV Part 2Bs to the Form ADV Part 1.
 
ADV Part 2A (PDF and Word Doc)
The Form ADV Part 2A acts as your firm’s brochure. It is a narrative description of your firm's services, fees, disciplinary disclosures, and several other firm details. The Form ADV Part 2A must be provided to all current and prospective clients. All jurisdictions require that the Form ADV Part 2A be written in “plain English” and easily understood by your firm's clients. After a thorough information gathering and interview process, RIA in a Box will create an Form ADV Part 2A built specifically to your firm’s business model while ensuring that its format, content, and disclosures meet your jurisdiction’s compliance requirements. Given that each RIA firm must provide the Form ADV Part 2A to all prospective and current clients, RIA in a Box will ensure the document is attractive, compliant, and accurate. In addition, RIA in a Box will brand your firm's Form ADV Part 2A Brochure with your firm’s logo.
 
Form U4 for One Representative
The Form U4 is the on-line component of an individual’s registration to a RIA Firm. The Form U4 is filed with the appropriate jurisdiction(s) in which an individual Investment Adviser Representative will be working by utilizing FINRA’s WebCRD system. The form must be accurate and includes biographical, residential, employment, outside business activities and disciplinary history. The information from this form is used to populate the publically available information on the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure search website maintained by the SEC.
 
Form ADV Part 2B for One Representative
The Form ADV Part 2B is the paper brochure that Investment Adviser Representatives must (generally) provide to clients. This form contains employment, educational, conflict of interest, and disciplinary information. Generally, Executive Officers, any person providing investment advice to clients, and any representative advising clients must have a Form ADV Part 2B.
 
Additional Filing Documents & Regulatory Paperwork
Many states require additional supplementary documents to be created which are unique to an individual state’s regulatory requirements. RIA in a Box will create these supplementary documents and file them with the state(s) as required.
 
Filing in Primary Jurisdiction
RIA in a Box will handle all required filings and ongoing correspondence with the relevant jurisdiction(s). Our experienced team will also address all deficiency letters on your behalf in a timely and compliant manner to ensure the registration process move as quickly as possible.
Additional fees apply for the registration of additional individual representatives ($350 per) and registering the firm in additional jurisdictions ($700 per). State/SEC filing fees, FINRA filing fees, and exam fees are not included in the prices above and go directly to the agencies.
Tailored Documents

 
Investment Advisory Agreement
RIA in a Box will provide your firm with a standard Client Advisory Agreement including an investment policy statement ensuring your firm's agreement meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards.
 
Privacy Policy Statements
The Firm’s Privacy Policy Statement must be provided to all clients at the beginning of the client relationship and annually thereafter. It must disclose how the firm stores, handles, and disseminates client information. The Privacy Policy Statement is built to your firm’s specifications and designed to meet regulatory authority compliance requirements.
 
Policies & Procedures / Compliance Manual
The firm’s Policies and Procedures manual is the guiding document that your firm will use to maintain and enforce your firm’s internal policies ranging from the handling of client complaints to the training of new Investment Adviser Representatives. It also houses your firm’s Business Continuity Plan, Information Security and Cyber Security Policy, Privacy Policy, Anti-money Laundering Policy, Anti-insider Trading Policy, Advertising Policy including the use of social media, and other required policies. In addition, the tailored manual addresses books and records requirements and the use of solicitors, due diligence of third party vendors, proxy voting, gifts and entertainment, soft dollar arrangements, and more.RIA in a Box will work with you to create a robust manual that is also a usable tool written in plain English. This is a very comprehensive, customized document that will be the foundation of conducting advisory business in a compliant manner.
 
Code of Ethics
RIA in a Box will help craft your firm’s Code of Ethics ensuring your firm meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards and is set up to conduct your business with the proper ethical standards.
 
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
RIA in a Box will help craft your firm’s Business Continuity Plan ensuring your firm meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards and is properly prepared should the unexpected business disruption occur.
 
Information Security Policy
RIA in a Box will tailor an information security policy unique to your firm to help address regulatory requirements and cyber security concerns. The policy will include an inventory of your firm's technology infrastructure, detailed security guidelines, user login and password management issues, the use of antivirus software, testing procedures, and many other areas of importance.









Adding Additional States:
While the description of your firm’s services and fees should remain constant across the jurisdictions (states) in which the firm is applying, different jurisdictions can have vastly different disclosure requirements. RIA in a Box will guide you through this process, creating and amending documents to ensure they are in compliance across all state jurisdictions.
A registered investment adviser must generally register in any state in which it has a physical location, a representative physically located, has more than 5 clients (or just 1 client in regards to Texas and Louisiana), or is actively soliciting in the state. 
Adding Additional Representatives:
All individual representatives of your firm need to be registered to the RIA if they are providing or generating advice. In general, all executive officers or people who have control of the RIA should also be registered to the firm. Registration includes filing a Form U4, ensuring the testing requirements or testing exemptions are satisfied, creating a Form ADV Part 2B brochure supplement and, in most cases, uploading that the Form ADV Part 2B to FINRA’s WebCRD system.

Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

Included Documents
Registration Filings
 


 
FINRA Entitlement
In order to file a registered investment adviser application with the appropriate regulatory jurisdiction, one must first apply to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for an account (Entitlement) to their WebCRD/IARD on-line system (the web application for the registration of RIA firms and their representatives). While RIA firms are in no way regulated or supervised by FINRA, the states and the SEC use FINRA’s WebCRD/IARD system to process applications. RIA in a Box will complete the appropriate Entitlement forms, submit, monitor, and establish the appropriate user permissions (Entitlements) to the account.
 
ADV Part 1 (online)
The Form ADV Part 1 is the on-line component of your Firm’s registration documentation. The Form ADV Part 1 primarily discloses information about the firm. Individual information is primarily disclosed in the Form U4 as detailed below. The Form ADV Part 1 is also the vehicle to upload your Firm’s Form ADV Part 2A (Firm Brochure) and Form ADV Part 2Bs (Brochure Supplements). RIA in a Box will complete the on-line Form ADV Part 1 and accompanying Schedules: A (Ownership Information); B (Indirect Ownership Information); D (Detailed information for Form ADV Part 1 disclosures including: Private Fund, Branch Office, and Affiliation Information disclosures), Form ADV Part 1B (Additional required information for state-registered firms); and also upload the Form ADV Part 2A and the Form ADV Part 2Bs to the Form ADV Part 1.
 
ADV Part 2A (PDF and Word Doc)
The Form ADV Part 2A acts as your firm’s brochure. It is a narrative description of your firm's services, fees, disciplinary disclosures, and several other firm details. The Form ADV Part 2A must be provided to all current and prospective clients. All jurisdictions require that the Form ADV Part 2A be written in “plain English” and easily understood by your firm's clients. After a thorough information gathering and interview process, RIA in a Box will create an Form ADV Part 2A built specifically to your firm’s business model while ensuring that its format, content, and disclosures meet your jurisdiction’s compliance requirements. Given that each RIA firm must provide the Form ADV Part 2A to all prospective and current clients, RIA in a Box will ensure the document is attractive, compliant, and accurate. In addition, RIA in a Box will brand your firm's Form ADV Part 2A Brochure with your firm’s logo.
 
Form U4 for One Representative
The Form U4 is the on-line component of an individual’s registration to a RIA Firm. The Form U4 is filed with the appropriate jurisdiction(s) in which an individual Investment Adviser Representative will be working by utilizing FINRA’s WebCRD system. The form must be accurate and includes biographical, residential, employment, outside business activities and disciplinary history. The information from this form is used to populate the publically available information on the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure search website maintained by the SEC.
 
Form ADV Part 2B for One Representative
The Form ADV Part 2B is the paper brochure that Investment Adviser Representatives must (generally) provide to clients. This form contains employment, educational, conflict of interest, and disciplinary information. Generally, Executive Officers, any person providing investment advice to clients, and any representative advising clients must have a Form ADV Part 2B.
 
Additional Filing Documents & Regulatory Paperwork
Many states require additional supplementary documents to be created which are unique to an individual state’s regulatory requirements. RIA in a Box will create these supplementary documents and file them with the state(s) as required.
 
Filing in Primary Jurisdiction
RIA in a Box will handle all required filings and ongoing correspondence with the relevant jurisdiction(s). Our experienced team will also address all deficiency letters on your behalf in a timely and compliant manner to ensure the registration process move as quickly as possible.
Additional fees apply for the registration of additional individual representatives ($350 per) and registering the firm in additional jurisdictions ($700 per). State/SEC filing fees, FINRA filing fees, and exam fees are not included in the prices above and go directly to the agencies.
Tailored Documents

 
Investment Advisory Agreement
RIA in a Box will provide your firm with a standard Client Advisory Agreement including an investment policy statement ensuring your firm's agreement meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards.
 
Privacy Policy Statements
The Firm’s Privacy Policy Statement must be provided to all clients at the beginning of the client relationship and annually thereafter. It must disclose how the firm stores, handles, and disseminates client information. The Privacy Policy Statement is built to your firm’s specifications and designed to meet regulatory authority compliance requirements.
 
Policies & Procedures / Compliance Manual
The firm’s Policies and Procedures manual is the guiding document that your firm will use to maintain and enforce your firm’s internal policies ranging from the handling of client complaints to the training of new Investment Adviser Representatives. It also houses your firm’s Business Continuity Plan, Information Security and Cyber Security Policy, Privacy Policy, Anti-money Laundering Policy, Anti-insider Trading Policy, Advertising Policy including the use of social media, and other required policies. In addition, the tailored manual addresses books and records requirements and the use of solicitors, due diligence of third party vendors, proxy voting, gifts and entertainment, soft dollar arrangements, and more.RIA in a Box will work with you to create a robust manual that is also a usable tool written in plain English. This is a very comprehensive, customized document that will be the foundation of conducting advisory business in a compliant manner.
 
Code of Ethics
RIA in a Box will help craft your firm’s Code of Ethics ensuring your firm meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards and is set up to conduct your business with the proper ethical standards.
 
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
RIA in a Box will help craft your firm’s Business Continuity Plan ensuring your firm meets the appropriate regulatory authority standards and is properly prepared should the unexpected business disruption occur.
 
Information Security Policy
RIA in a Box will tailor an information security policy unique to your firm to help address regulatory requirements and cyber security concerns. The policy will include an inventory of your firm's technology infrastructure, detailed security guidelines, user login and password management issues, the use of antivirus software, testing procedures, and many other areas of importance.









Adding Additional States:
While the description of your firm’s services and fees should remain constant across the jurisdictions (states) in which the firm is applying, different jurisdictions can have vastly different disclosure requirements. RIA in a Box will guide you through this process, creating and amending documents to ensure they are in compliance across all state jurisdictions.
A registered investment adviser must generally register in any state in which it has a physical location, a representative physically located, has more than 5 clients (or just 1 client in regards to Texas and Louisiana), or is actively soliciting in the state. 
Adding Additional Representatives:
All individual representatives of your firm need to be registered to the RIA if they are providing or generating advice. In general, all executive officers or people who have control of the RIA should also be registered to the firm. Registration includes filing a Form U4, ensuring the testing requirements or testing exemptions are satisfied, creating a Form ADV Part 2B brochure supplement and, in most cases, uploading that the Form ADV Part 2B to FINRA’s WebCRD system.

Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
