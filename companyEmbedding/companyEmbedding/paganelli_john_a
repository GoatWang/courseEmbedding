He happily showed me all his equipment and how it worked. He had contacts all over the globe right from his home, long before there was the internet. At the time it was amazing to me.

Mr. Paganelli was kind and always warm towards me. When I was a teenager I was excited to learn he was a HAM operator. I had heard about it and wanted to know more. He happily showed me all his equipment and how it worked. He had contacts all over the globe right from his home, long before there was the internet. At the time it was amazing to me.  I saw first hand what a terrific father he was to John. He and his wife were so welcoming and made John's friends feel like part of their family. I never felt awkward or in the way. John's parents have been a gift in my life and a beautiful example of a loving marriage. Of Mr. Paganelli I could say "they don't make 'em like that anymore." He was a true gentleman.
