The
  purpose of this policy is to provide life insurance protection for the

�
We
  offer
  a variety of variable universal life policies.��Despite offering

  may have
  lower overall charges than others, including this policy.��These

�
Subject
  to conditions, you may choose to borrow against, or withdraw, the Cash Value
  of
  your policy:
�




���

  the
  same payout options as if it constituted a Death
  Benefit.




�

  more
  information, see "Full Surrender," beginning on page 24 and "The Payout
  Options,� beginning on page 25.
�
Premium
  Flexibility
�

�
Investment
  Options
�
You
  may

���


The
  variable investment options constitute the limitedly available
  mutual
  funds, and we have divided Nationwide VL Separate Account-C into
  a number
  of Sub-Account portfolios, identified in��"Variable Investment
  Options," beginning on page 7, to account for your
  allocations.��Your Investment Experience will depend on the
  market performance of the Sub-Account portfolios you have
  chosen.






�

�


We
  have
  implemented procedures intended to reduce the potentially detrimental impact
  that disruptive trading has on Sub-Account Investment Experience.��For
  more information, see "Sub-Account Portfolio Transfers," beginning on page
  11
  and "Modes To Make A Transfer," beginning on page 12.
�
Transfers

  transfer between the fixed and variable investment options, subject to
  conditions.��You may transfer among the Sub-Account portfolios of the
  variable investment option within limits.��For more information, see
  "Sub-Account Portfolio Transfers," beginning on page 11.��We also
  offer dollar cost averaging, an automated investment strategy that spreads
  out
  transfers over time to try to reduce the investment risks of market
  fluctuations.��For more information, see "Dollar Cost Averaging,"
  beginning on page 26.
�
Taxes
�
Unless
  you make a withdrawal, you will generally not be taxed on any
  earnings.��This is known as tax deferral.��For more
  information, see "The Minimum Required Death Benefit," beginning on page
  23.��Also, your beneficiary generally will not have to account for the
  Death Benefit Proceeds as taxable income.��For more information, see
  "Taxes," beginning on page 28.

  assign the policy as collateral for a loan or another obligation while the

�

In
  Summary: Policy
  Risks

�
Improper
  Use
�
Variable
  universal life insurance is not suitable as an investment vehicle for short-term
  savings.��It is designed for long-term financial
  planning.��You will incur fees at the time of purchase that may more
  than offset any favorable Investment Experience.��As this may be
  particularly true early on, you should not purchase the policy if you expect
  that you will need to access its Cash Value in the near future.
�
Unfavorable
  Investment Return
�
The
  variable investment options to which you have chosen to allocate Net Premium
  may
  not generate a sufficient, let alone a positive, return, especially after
  the
  deductions for policy and Sub-Account portfolio charges.��Investment
  Experience will impact the cash value, and poor Investment Experience (in
  conjunction with your flexibility to make changes to the policy and deviate
  from
  your chosen premium payment plan) could cause the Cash Value of your policy
  to
  decrease, resulting in a Lapse of insurance coverage sooner than might have
  been
  foreseen.
�
Effect
  Of Partial Surrenders And Loans On Investment Returns
�
Partial
  surrenders or policy loans may accelerate a Lapse because these amounts will
  no
  longer be available to generate any investment return.��A partial
  surrender will reduce the amount of Cash Value allocated among the Sub-Account
  portfolios you have chosen, and to the fixed account, too, if there is not
  enough Cash Value in the Sub-Account portfolios.��As collateral for a
  policy loan, we will transfer an equal amount of Cash Value to the policy
  loan
  account, which will also reduce the Cash Value allocated between and among
  your
  chosen investment options.��Thus, the remainder of your policy's Cash
  Value is all that would be available to generate an investment return sufficient
  to cover policy and Sub-Account portfolio charges and keep the policy In
  Force,
  at least until you repay the loan or make another Premium
  payment.��There will always be a Grace Period, and the opportunity to
  reinstate insurance coverage.��Under certain circumstances, however,
  the policy could terminate without value, and insurance coverage would
  cease.


�


2





�


�
Reduction
  Of The Death Benefit
�
A
  partial
  surrender or a policy loan would decrease the policy�s Death Benefit, depending
  on how the Death Benefit relates to the policy�s Cash Value.
�
Adverse
  Tax Consequences
Existing
  federal tax laws that benefit this policy may change at any
  time.��These changes could alter the favorable federal income tax
  treatment the policy enjoys, such as the deferral of taxation on the gains
  in
  the policy's Cash Value and the exclusion from taxable income of the Proceeds
  we
  pay to the policy's Beneficiary.��Partial and full surrenders from the
  policy may be subject to taxes.��The income tax treatment of the
  surrender of Cash Value is different in the event the policy is treated as
  a
  modified endowment contract under the Code.��Generally, tax treatment
  on modified endowment contracts will be less favorable when compared to having
  the policy treated as a life insurance contract.��Consult a qualified
  tax adviser on all tax matters involving your policy.
�
Fixed
  Account Transfer Restrictions And Limitations
�
You
  may
  transfer Cash Value to or from the fixed account so long as you make the
  request
  after the first year from the Policy Date.��Then, we will honor a
  transfer request from the fixed account that is made within 30 days of the
  end
  of a calendar quarter, but not within 12 months of a previous request. We
  may
  also limit what percentage of Cash Value you will be permitted to transfer
  to or
  from the fixed account.
�
Sub-Account
  Portfolio Investment Risk
�
Frequent
  trading among the Sub-Accounts may dilute the value of your Sub-Account units,
  cause the Sub-Account to incur higher transaction costs, and interfere with
  the
  Sub-Accounts' ability to pursue its stated investment objective.��This
  disruption to the Sub-Account may result in lower Investment Experience and
  Cash
  Value.��We have instituted procedures to minimize disruptive
  transfers.��For more information, see "Sub-Account Portfolio
  Transfers," beginning on page 11 and "Modes To Make A Transfer," beginning
  on
  page 12.��While we expect these procedures to reduce the adverse
  effect of disruptive transfers, we cannot assure you that we have eliminated
  these risks.
�
A
  comprehensive discussion of the risks of the mutual funds held by each
  Sub-Account portfolio may be found in that mutual fund�s prospectus. You should
  read the mutual fund�s prospectus carefully before investing.
�

In
  Summary: Variable Universal
  Life Insurance And The Policy

�
Variable
  Universal Life Insurance, in general, may be important to you in two
  ways:
�




���


It
  will provide economic protection to a
  beneficiary.




�




���


It
  may build Cash Value.




�
Why
  would you want to purchase this type of life insurance?��How will you
  allocate the Net Premium among the variable investment options and the fixed
  investment options?��Your reasons and decisions will affect the
  insurance and Cash Value aspects.
�
While
  variable universal life insurance is designed primarily to provide life
  insurance protection, the Cash Value of a policy will be important to you
  in
  that it may impair (with poor investment results) or enhance (with favorable
  investment results) your ability to pay the costs of keeping the insurance
  In
  Force.
�
Apart
  from the life insurance protection features, you will have an interest in
  maximizing the value of the policy as a financial asset.
�
It
  is similar to, but also different from, universal life
  insurance.
�




���


You
  will pay Premiums for life insurance coverage on the
  Insured.




�




���


The
  policy will provide for the accumulation of a Cash Surrender Value
  if you
  were to surrender it at any time while the Insured is
  alive.




�




���


The
  Cash Surrender Value could be substantially lower than the Premiums
  you
  have paid.




�
What
  makes the policy different from universal life insurance is your opportunity
  to
  allocate Premiums after charges to the Sub-Account portfolios you have
  chosen.��Also, this policy�s cash value will vary depending on the
  market performance of the Sub-Account portfolios, and you will bear this
  risk.
�
From
  the time we issue the policy through the Insured�s death, following is a basic
  overview.��( Please read the remainder of this prospectus for the
  details.)
�




���


At
  issue, the policy will require a minimum initial Premium
  payment.






�


3





�


�
Among
  other considerations, this amount will be based on: the Insured�s age; the
  underwriting class; any substandard ratings; the Specified Amount; and the
  choice of a Rider.
�




���


At
  the time of a Premium payment, we will deduct transaction
  fees.




�




���


You
  will then be able to allocate the Premium net of transaction fees,
  or Net
  Premium, between and among a fixed and the variable investment
  options.




�




���


From
  the policy�s Cash Value, on a periodic basis, we will deduct other charges
  to help cover the mortality risks we assumed, and the sales and
  administrative costs.��We call these charges periodic charges
  other than Sub-Account portfolio operating
  expenses.




�




���


You
  may be able to vary the timing and amount of Premium
  payments.




�
So
  long as there is enough Cash Surrender Value to cover the policy's periodic
  charges as they come due, the policy will remain In Force.
�




���


After
  the first policy year, you may request to increase or decrease
  the
  policy�s Specified Amount.




�
This
  flexibility will allow you to adjust the policy to meet your changing needs
  and
  circumstances, subject to: additional underwriting (for us to evaluate an
  increase of risk); confirmation that the policy�s tax status is not jeopardized;
  and confirmation that the minimum and maximum insurance amounts remain
  met.
�




���


The
  policy will pay a Death Benefit to the beneficiary.��You have a
  choice of one of three options.




�
As
  your insurance needs change, you may be able to change Death Benefit options,
  rather than buying a new policy, or terminating this policy.
�




���


Prior
  to the Insured�s death you may withdraw all, or a portion (after the first
  policy year), of the policy�s Cash Surrender Value.��Or you may
  borrow against the Cash Surrender
  Value.




�
Withdrawals
  and loans are subject to restrictions, may reduce the Death Benefit and increase
  the likelihood of the policy lapsing.��There also could be adverse tax
  consequences.


�

In
  Summary: Fee Tables

�
The
  following tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying,
  owning and surrendering the policy.��Fees in this table may be rounded
  to the hundredth decimal.��The first table describes the fees and
  expenses that you will pay at the time that you buy the policy, surrender
  the
  policy or transfer Cash Value between
  investmentoptions.

We
  charge interest on the amount of an outstanding policy loan, at
  the rate
  of no more than 3.75% per annum, which accrues daily and becomes
  due and
  payable at the end of the year from the Policy Date or at the time
  you
  take an additional loan.��Currently, for policies issued on or
  after September 9, 2002, we expect to charge an effective annual
  interest
  rate of 3.70% on the outstanding balance of your policy loan for
  the first
  fifteen policy years, 3.45% for policy years 16 through 30, and
  3.00%
  thereafter. Currently, for policies issued prior to September 9,
2002, we
  expect to charge an effective annual interest rate of 3.40% on
  the
  outstanding balance of your policy loan for the first four policy
  years,
  3.25% for policy years 5 through 20, and 3.10% thereafter.��If
  left unpaid, we will add it to the loan account.��As collateral
  or security for repayment, we transfer an equal amount of Cash
  Value to
  the policy loan account, on which interest accrues and is credited
  daily.��The minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate is stated
  on your Policy Data Page. The effect of the crediting will be a
  net cost
  of a policy loan that is less than the loan amount interest
  charge.��For more information, see "Policy Loans," beginning on

Policy
  Investment
  Options

�
You
  may
  choose to allocate all or a portion of your Net Premium to any
  Sub-Account.��When this actually happens depends on the
  right-to-examine law of the state in which you live.��Or you may
  choose to allocate all or a portion of your Net Premium to the fixed investment
  option, and we will allocate it when we receive it.
�
Based
  on
  the right to examine law, some states require that we refund the initial
  Premium
  if you exercise your right to cancel the policy.��Others require that
  we return the Cash Value.��If yours is a state that requires us to
  refund the initial Premium, we will hold the initial Net Premium in the
  available money market Sub-Account until the free-look period
  expires.��Once your examination right ends, we will transfer the
  variable account Cash Value to your Sub-Account allocations in effect at
  the
  time of the transfer.��If yours is a state that requires us to refund
  the Cash Value, we will allocate the Net Premiums to the Sub-Account choices
  in
  effect when we receive the Premium payment.��After your right to
  cancel the policy expires, all Premium payments will be allocated to the
  Sub-Account choices in effect when we received the Premium payment.
�
The
  Fixed Investment Option
�
The
  Premium you allocate to the fixed investment option is held in the fixed
  account, which is part of our general account.��The general account
  contains all of our assets other than those in the separate accounts and
  funds
  the fixed investment option.��These assets are subject to our general
  liabilities from business operations.��The general account is used to
  support our insurance and annuity obligations.��Any amounts in excess
  of the separate account liabilities are deposited into our general
  account.��We bear the full investment risk for all amounts allocated
  to the fixed account.
�
We
  guarantee that the amounts you allocate to the fixed investment option will
  be
  credited interest daily at a net effective annual interest rate of no less
  than
  the stated interest crediting rate on the Policy Data Page.��We will
  credit any interest in excess of the guaranteed interest crediting rate at
  our
  sole discretion.��You assume the risk that the interest we credit to
  the amounts you allocate to the fixed investment option may not exceed the
  minimum guarantee of the guaranteed interest crediting rate for any given
  year.
�
The
  amounts you allocate to the fixed investment option will not share in the
  investment performance of our general account.��Rather, the investment
  income you earn on your allocations will be based on varying rates we
  set.��Currently, the rates are set at the beginning of each calendar
  quarter and will be effective for at least three months.
�
The
  general account is not subject to the same laws as the separate account,
  and the
  SEC has not reviewed the disclosures in this prospectus relating to the fixed
  account.��However, information about the fixed account is subject to
  federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements
  made by prospectus disclosure.
�
Variable
  Investment Options
�
The
  separate account invests in shares of the available Sub-Account
  portfolios.��Each Sub-Account portfolio invests in a mutual fund that
  is registered with the SEC.��This registration does not involve
  supervision of the management or investment practices or policies of the
  portfolios or mutual funds by the SEC.
�
Each
  Sub-Account portfolio�s assets are held separately from the assets of the other
  Sub-Account portfolios, and each Sub-Account portfolio has investment objectives
  and policies that are different from those of the other Sub-Account
  portfolios.��Thus, each Sub-Account portfolio operates as a separate
  investment fund, and the income or losses of one Sub-Account portfolio generally
  have no effect on the investment performance of any other Sub-Account
  portfolio.��The "Appendix A: Sub-Account Information" section
  identifies the available mutual funds, by name, investment type and adviser,
  and
  includes expense information for each.

���


an
  emergency exists making disposal or valuation of securities held
  in the
  separate account impracticable; or








���


the
  SEC, by order, permits a suspension or postponement for the protection
  of

�
SEC
  rules
  and regulations govern when the conditions described above exist.��Any
  transaction you try to effect when we are closed will not happen until the
  next
  day we and the NYSE are both open for business.
�
How
  Sub-Account Investment Experience Is Determined
�
Though
  the number of Sub-Account Units will not change as a result of Investment
  Experience, changes in the net investment factor, as described below, may
  cause
  the value of a Sub-Account Unit to increase or decrease from Valuation Period
  to
  Valuation Period.��Changes in the net investment factor may not be
  directly proportional to changes in the Net Asset Value of the mutual fund
  shares, because of the deduction for mortality and expense risk charge, and
  any
  charge or credit for tax reserves.
�
We
  determine the change in Sub-Account values at the end of a Valuation
  Period.��The Sub-Account Unit value for a Valuation Period is
  determined by multiplying the Sub-Account Unit value as of the prior Valuation
  Period by the net investment factor for the Sub-Account for the current
  Valuation Period.
�
We
  determine the net investment factor for any Valuation Period by dividing
  (a) by
  (b) and then subtracting (c) where:
�
(a)
  is
  the sum of:
�




���


the
  Net Asset Value per share of the mutual fund held in the Sub-Account
  as of
  the end of the current Valuation Period;
  and








���


the
  per share amount of any dividend or income distributions made by
  the
  mutual fund (if the date of the dividend or income distribution
  occurs
  during the current Valuation Period); plus or
  minus








���


a
  per share charge or credit for any taxes reserved for as a result
  of the
  Sub-Account's investment operations if changes to the law result
  in a
  modification to the tax treatment of the separate account;
  and




�




�


(b)
  is the Net Asset Value per share of the mutual fund determined
  as of the
  end of the immediately preceding Valuation Period after taxes or
  tax
  credits; and




�
(c)
  is a
  charge for Mortality and Expense Risk.
�
Cash
  Value
�
The
  policy has a Cash Value.��There is no guaranteed Cash
  Value.��The Cash Value will vary depending on where you allocate your
  Net Premium.��Amounts allocated to the fixed account and policy loan
  account vary based on the daily crediting of interest to those
  accounts.��Amounts allocated to the Sub-Account portfolios vary daily
  based on the Investment Experience of the Sub-Account portfolios.��It
  will also vary because we deduct the policy's periodic charges from the cash
  value.��So, if the policy's Cash Value is part of the Death Benefit
  option you have chosen, then your Death Benefit will fluctuate.
�
We
  compute the Cash Value of your policy by adding the Sub-Account portfolio
  Unit
  values to the money you have allocated to the fixed investment option and
  adding
  the amount in the policy loan account.
�
We
  will
  determine the value of the assets in the separate account at the end of each
  Valuation Period.��We will determine the Cash Value at least monthly.
  To determine the number of Sub-Account Units credited to each Sub-Account,
  we
  divide the net amount you allocate to the Sub-Account by the Sub-Account
  Unit
  value for the Sub-Account (using the next Valuation Period following when
  we
  receive the Premium).
�
If
  you
  surrender part or all of the policy, we will deduct a number of Sub-Account
  Units from the separate account and an amount from the fixed account that
  corresponds to the surrendered amount.��Thus, your policy�s Cash Value
  will be reduced by the surrendered amount.��If we assess a partial
  surrender charge, we will subtract the charge from the proceeds before
  delivering the net amount to you.
�
Similarly,
  when we assess charges or deductions, a number of Sub-Account Units from
  the
  separate account and an amount from the fixed account that corresponds with
  the
  charge or deduction will be deducted from the policy�s Cash
  Value.��Unless you direct otherwise, we make these deductions in the
  same proportion that your interests in the separate account and the fixed
  account bear to the policy�s total Cash Value.
�
The
  Cash
  Value in the fixed account and the policy loan account is credited with interest
  daily at the guaranteed minimum annual effective rate stated on the Policy
  Data
  Page.��We may decide to credit interest in excess of the guaranteed
  minimum


�


10





�


annual
  effective rate.��For the fixed account, we will guarantee the current
  rate in effect through the end of the calendar quarter. Upon request, we
  will
  inform you of the current applicable rates for each account.��For more
  information, see "The Fixed Investment Option," beginning on page 7, and
  "Loan
  Amount And Interest," beginning on page 27.
�
On
  any
  date during the policy year, the Cash Value equals the Cash Value on the
  preceding Valuation Period, plus any Net Premium applied since the previous
  Valuation Period, minus any policy charges, plus or minus any investment
  results, and minus any partial surrenders.
�

Transfers
  Among and Between Policy
  Investment Options

�
Sub-Account
  Portfolio Transfers
�
We
  will
  determine the amount you have available for transfers among the Sub-Account
  portfolios in Units based on the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of the mutual
  fund in which a Sub-Account portfolio invests.��The mutual fund will
  determine its NAV once daily as of the close of the regular business session
  of
  the New York Stock Exchange (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).��A Unit
  will not equal the NAV of the mutual fund in which the Sub-Account portfolio
  invests, however, because the Unit value will reflect the deduction for any
  transaction fees and periodic charges.��For more information, see "In
  Summary: Fee Tables," beginning on page 5, and "How Sub-Account Investment
  Experience Is Determined," beginning on page 10.
�
Disruptive
  trading practices, which hamper the orderly pursuit of stated investment
  objectives by underlying mutual fund managers, may adversely affect the
  performance of the Sub-Accounts.��Prior to the policy�s Maturity Date,
  you may transfer among the available Sub-Account portfolios; however, in
  instances of disruptive trading that we may determine, or may have already
  determined to be harmful to policy owners, we will, through the use of
  appropriate means available to us, attempt to curtail or limit the disruptive
  trading.��We cannot guarantee that our attempts to deter active
  trading strategies will be successful.��If active trading strategies
  are not successfully deterred by our actions, the performance of Sub-Accounts
  that are actively traded will be adversely impacted.��If your trading
  activities, or those of a third party acting on your behalf, constitute
  disruptive trading, we will not limit your ability to initiate the trades
  as
  provided in your policy; however, we may limit your means for making a transfer
  or take other action we deem necessary to protect the interests of those
  investing in the affected Sub-Accounts.��If you intend to use an
  active trading strategy, you should consult your registered representative
  and
  request information on our other policy that offers Sub-Accounts designed
  specifically to support active trading.
�
We
  may
  add new underlying mutual funds, or new share classes of currently available
  underlying mutual funds, that assess short-term trading fees.��In the
  case of new share class additions, your subsequent allocations may be limited
  to
  that new share class.��Short-term trading fees are a charge assessed
  by an underlying mutual fund when you transfer out of a Sub-Account before
  the
  end of a stated period.��These fees will only apply to Sub-Accounts
  corresponding to underlying mutual funds that impose such a
  charge.��The underlying mutual fund intends short-term trading fees to
  compensate the fund and its shareholders for the negative impact on fund
  performance that may result from disruptive trading practices, including
  frequent trading and short-term trading (market timing)
  strategies.��The fees are not intended to adversely impact policy
  owners not engaged in such strategies.��The separate account will
  collect the short-term trading fees at the time of the transfer by reducing
  the
  policy owner�s Sub-Account value.��We will remit all such fees to the
  underlying mutual fund.
�
Underlying
  Mutual Fund Restrictions and Prohibitions.��Pursuant to
  regulations adopted by the SEC, we are required to enter into written agreements
  with the underlying mutual funds which allow the underlying mutual funds
  to:
�




(1)��


request
  the taxpayer identification number, international taxpayer identification
  number, or other government issued identifier of any of our policy
  owners;








(2)��


request
  the amounts and dates of any purchase, redemption, transfer or
  exchange
  request (�transaction information�);
  and








(3)��


instruct
  us to restrict or prohibit further purchases or exchanges by policy
  owners
  that violate policies established by the underlying mutual fund
  (whose
  policies may be more restrictive than our
  policies).




�
We
  are
  required to provide such transaction information to the underlying mutual
  funds
  upon their request.��In addition, we are required to restrict or
  prohibit further purchases or exchange requests upon instruction from the
  underlying mutual fund.��We and any affected policy owner may not have
  advance notice of such instructions from an underlying mutual fund to restrict
  or prohibit further purchases or exchange requests.��If an underlying
  mutual fund refuses to accept a purchase or exchange request submitted by
  us, we
  will keep any affected policy owner in their current underlying mutual fund
  allocation.
�
Fixed
  Account Transfers
�
Prior
  to
  the policy�s Maturity Date, you may also make transfers involving the fixed
  account.��These transfers will be in dollars, and we reserve the right
  to limit their timing and amount, including that you may not make more than
  one
  transfer every 12 months.��However, during the first 24 months
  following the initial Policy Date you may irrevocably elect to
  transfer


�


11





�


all
  of
  the Cash Value to the fixed account.��For more information, see "To
  Irrevocably Transfer Cash Value Or Exchange The Policy," on page
  14.
�
On
  transfers to the fixed account, we may not permit you to transfer over
  20% of the Cash Value allocated to the Sub-Account portfolios as of the
  close of business of the prior Valuation Period.��We reserve the right
  to refuse any transfer to the fixed account if the fixed account�s Cash Value
  comprises more than 30% of the policy�s Cash Value. You may not request a
  transfer to the fixed account before the end of the first year from the
  Policy Date.
�
On
  transfers from the fixed account, we may permit you transfers of no
  more than 20% of the Cash Value of the fixed account as of the end of the
  previous policy year (subject to state restrictions).��Any transfers
  you make from the fixed account must be within 45 days of the end of a interest
  rate guaranteed period.��An interest rate guaranteed period is the
  time that a stated interest rate is guaranteed to remain in
  effect.��Currently, interest crediting rates are reset at the
  beginning of each calendar quarter.
�
Modes
  To Make A Transfer
�
To
  make a
  transfer, send your written request to us at our Home Office via first class
  U.S. mail.��Upon receipt, we will process a transfer request at the
  end of the current Valuation Period.��We may also permit you to use
  other modes of communication, subject to limitations.
�
Our
  contact information is on the cover page of this
  prospectus.
�
With
  respect to any telephonic or electronic mode of communication, including
  the
  Internet, we monitor transfer activity for potentially harmful investment
  practices.���For policies owned by a natural person, you are
  limited to 20 "transfer events" per calendar year.��If you initiate
  transfer events within a lesser time interval at a pace that is equivalent
  to 20
  within a year, you may be required to submit all subsequent transfers via
  U.S.
  mail.��To calculate transfer events, at the end of each Valuation
  Period, we will group together all of your transfer requests for the
  day.��We will count this grouping as a "transfer event," regardless of
  the number of Sub-Accounts involved.��Once 20 transfer events or the
  equivalent occur, you may continue to make transfers, but only by sending
  your
  written request to us at our Home Office via first class U.S. mail until
  the end
  of the year.��Then, we begin to count transfer events over
  again.
�
For
  policies owned by a corporation or another entity, we monitor transfer activity
  for potentially harmful investment practices; however, we do not systematically
  monitor the transfer instructions of individual persons.��Our
  procedures include the review of aggregate entity-level transfers, not
  individual transfer instructions.��It is our intention to protect the
  interests of all contract owners; it is possible, however, for some harmful
  trading to go on undetected by us.��For example, in some instances, an
  entity may make transfers based on the instruction of multiple parties such
  as
  employees, partners, or other affiliated persons based on those persons�
participation in entity sponsored programs.��We do not systematically
  monitor the transfer instructions of these individual persons.��We
  monitor aggregate trades among the Sub-Accounts for frequency, pattern, and
  size.��If two or more transfer events are submitted in a 30 day
  period, we may impose conditions on your ability to submit trades. These
  restrictions include revoking your privilege to make trades by any means
  other
  than written communication submitted via U.S. mail for a twelve-month
  period.
�
We
  have
  the right to restrict transfer requests, or take any other action we deem
  necessary, in order to protect policy owners and beneficiaries from the negative
  investment results that may result from harmful investment practices employed
  by
  some policy owners (or third parties acting on their behalf).��In
  particular, we may restrict trading strategies designed to avoid or take
  advantage of our monitoring procedures and other measures aimed at curbing
  harmful trading practices.
�
Some
  investment advisers/representatives manage the assets of multiple Nationwide
  policies pursuant to trading authority granted or conveyed by multiple policy
  owners.��We generally will require multi-policy advisers to submit all
  transfer requests via U.S. mail.
�
We
  will
  consider each request by any means as a single transfer regardless of the
  number
  of Sub-Accounts involved.��We will employ reasonable procedures to
  confirm that instructions are genuine, especially with respect to communication
  via the internet or telephone, including:
�




���


requiring
  forms of personal identification before acting upon
  instructions;




�




���


providing
  you with written confirmation of completed transactions;
  and/or




�




���


recording
  telephone instructions.




�
If
  we
  follow these procedures, we will not be liable for any loss, damage, cost
  or
  expense from complying with what we reasonably believe to be genuine
  instructions.��Rather, you will bear the risk of
  loss.


�

�


Any
  computer system or telephone, whether it is yours, your service provider�s, your
  representative�s, or ours, can experience slowdowns or outages for a variety of
  reasons.��These slowdowns or outages may delay or prevent our ability
  to process your request.��Although we have taken precautions to help
  our system handle heavy usage, we cannot promise complete reliability under
  all
  circumstances.��If you are experiencing problems, you should make your
  request in writing.
�

The
  Policy

�
The
  policy is a legal contract between you and us��(any change to which we
  would want to make must be in writing, signed by our president and secretary,
  and attached to or endorsed on the policy).��You may exercise all
  policy rights and options while the Insured is alive.��You may also
  change the policy, but only in accordance with its terms.
�
Generally,
  the policy is available for an Insured between the ages of 18-79 (although
  these
  ages may vary in your state).��It is nonparticipating, meaning we will
  not be contributing any operating profits or surplus earnings toward the
  Proceeds from the policy.��The policy will comprise and be evidenced
  by: a written contract; any Riders; any endorsements; and the application,
  including any supplemental application.��We will consider the
  statements you make in the application as representations.��We will
  rely on them as being true and complete.��However, we will not void
  the policy or deny a claim unless a statement is a material
  misrepresentation.
�
In
  order
  to comply with the USA Patriot Act and rules promulgated thereunder, Nationwide
  will implement procedures designed to prevent policies described in this
  prospectus from being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing
  of
  terrorist activities.
�
Policy
  Owner Rights
�
The
  policy belongs to the owner named in the application, or the person to whom
  the
  policy or any ownership rights in the policy have been validly
  assigned.��You may also name a contingent policy
  owner.��While the Insured is alive, the owner may exercise all policy
  rights and options. To the extent permitted by law, policy benefits are not
  subject to any legal process for the payment of any claim, and no right or
  benefit will be subject to claims of creditors (except as may be provided
  by
  assignment).
�
The
  Insured is the person named in the application.��You may change the
  Insured by submitting a change request to us in writing.��If approved
  by us, the change will become effective when it was signed, rather than the
  date
  we received it.��The policy charges after the change will be based
  upon the new Insured�s characteristics.��For more information, see
  "Change Of Insured Rider," on page 16.
�
The
  Beneficiary
�
The
  beneficiary, or beneficiaries, is first in line to receive the Death Benefit
  Proceeds from the policy.��You name the beneficiary in the application
  for the policy.��You may name more than one
  beneficiary.��The policy permits you to designate primary and
  contingent beneficiaries.
�
If
  a
  primary beneficiary dies before the Insured, that beneficiary's interest
  will be
  paid to any surviving beneficiary. We will pay multiple primary beneficiaries
  in
  equal shares, unless you provide for another distribution.
�
You
  may
  name a contingent beneficiary, or beneficiaries, in the application for the
  policy.��The contingent beneficiary will become the primary
  beneficiary if all primary beneficiaries die before the Insured, and before
  any
  Proceeds become payable.��You may name more than one contingent
  beneficiary.��We will also pay multiple contingent beneficiaries in
  equal shares, unless you provide for another distribution.
�
You
  may
  also change or add beneficiaries or contingent beneficiaries while the Insured
  is living.��Any change must be in writing and satisfactory to
  us.��We must receive the change at our Home Office, and we may require
  that you send us your policy for endorsement to the address on the cover
  page of
  this prospectus before we record the change.��Once we record the
  change, the change will be effective as of the date it was signed rather
  than
  the date we received it.��The change will not affect any payment we
  made or action we took before we recorded the change.
�
To
  Purchase
�
To
  purchase the policy, you must submit to us a completed application and an
  initial Premium payment.
�
We
  must
  receive evidence of insurability that satisfies our underwriting standards
  (this
  may require a medical evidence) before we will issue a policy.��We can
  provide you with the details of our underwriting standards.��We
  reserve the right to reject an application for any reason permitted by
  law.��Specifically, if we have previously issued you policies with an
  aggregate scheduled annual premium(s) that exceed $15 million, we reserve
  the
  right to refuse to issue an additional policy to you.��Also, we
  reserve the right to modify our underwriting standards at any time.
�
The
  minimum initial Specified Amount in most states is $50,000.
�
We
  reserve the right to modify our minimum Specified Amount for new applicants
  at
  any time.


�

�


�
Coverage
�
We
  will
  issue the policy only if the underwriting process has been completed, we
  have
  approved the application and the proposed Insured is alive and in the same
  condition of health as described in the application.��However, full
  insurance coverage will take effect only after you have paid the minimum
  initial
  Premium.��We begin to deduct monthly charges from your policy Cash
  Value on the Policy Date.
�
Coverage
  Effective Date
�
Insurance
  coverage begins and is In Force on the later of (i) the Policy Date shown
  on the
  Policy Data Page and (ii) the date the initial Premium is paid.��It
  will end when the policy Lapses, or when we pay all the Proceeds from the
  policy.��We may provide temporary insurance coverage before full
  insurance coverage takes effect, subject to our underwriting standards and
  the
  policy conditions.
�
To
  Cancel (Examination Right)
�
You
  may
  cancel your policy during the free look period.��The free look period
  expires ten days after you receive the policy or longer if required by
  law.��If you decide to cancel during the free look period, return the
  policy to the sales representative who sold it to you, or to us at our Home
  Office, along with your written cancellation request.��Within seven
  days, we will refund the amount prescribed by the law of the state in which
  we
  issued the policy.��We will treat the policy as if we never issued
  it.��Because of the free look period, when we actually allocate Net
  Premium to the Sub-Account portfolios based on your choices depends on the
  right
  to examine law of the state in which you live.��For more information,
  see "Allocation of Premium and Cash Value," beginning on page 9 .
�
To
  Change Coverage
�
After
  the
  first policy year, you may request to change the Specified
  Amount.��Changes may result in additional charges; however, no change
  will take effect unless the new Cash Surrender Value is sufficient to keep
  the
  policy In Force for at least three months.��Changes to the Specified
  Amount will alter the Death Benefit.��For more information, see
  "Changes In The Death Benefit Option," beginning on page 23.
�
If
  you
  decide to increase the Specified Amount, you must provide us with evidence
  of
  insurability that satisfies our underwriting standards. The Insured must
  be
  within the required issue ages of 18 to 79.��The increase must be for
  at least $10,000 and the amount of insurance after increase may not exceed
  the
  maximum amount that is generally no more than the policy�s Cash Value plus
  $8,000,000.��For more information, see "Calculation Of The Death
  Benefit Proceeds," beginning on page 22.
�
You
  may
  request to decrease the Specified Amount.��We first apply decreases to
  the amount of insurance coverage as a result of any prior Specified Amount
  increases, starting with the most recent.��Then we will decrease the
  initial Specified Amount.��We will deny a request, however, to reduce
  the amount of your coverage below the minimum initial Specified
  Amount.��Also, we will deny a request that would disqualify the policy
  as a contract for life insurance.
�
To
  change
  the Specified Amount, you must submit your written request to us at our Home
  Office.��Changes will become effective on the next monthly anniversary
  from the Policy Date after we approve the request.��We reserve the
  right to limit the number of changes to one each year.
�
To
  Irrevocably Transfer Cash Value Or Exchange The Policy
�
During
  the first 24 months of coverage, you have a right to irrevocably elect to
  transfer 100% of the policy's Cash Value to the fixed account, irrespective
  of
  our right to limit transfers to the fixed account.��After this
  election, you no longer will be able to participate in the Investment Experience
  of the Sub-Account portfolios.��Rather, the policy's Cash Value will
  be credited with the fixed account's interest rate.��You must make
  your request on our official forms to the Home Office.
�
After
  the
  first 24 months of coverage, you may make a request to exchange the policy
  for a
  different policy so long as we receive evidence that the Insured meets our
  underwriting standards of insurability. The new policy may be one of our
  available flexible premium adjustable life insurance policies that does not
  have
  a greater Death Benefit than this policy immediately prior to the exchange
  date.��For more information, see "In Summary: Fee Tables," beginning
  on page 5.��The exchange may have tax consequences.��For
  more information, see "Exchanging The Policy For Another Life Insurance Policy,"
  beginning on page 31��This policy will terminate when the new policy
  takes effect.
�
To
  Terminate Or Surrender
�
You
  have
  the right to terminate the policy.��Or you may surrender the policy
  for its Cash Surrender Value.��The policy will automatically terminate
  when the Insured dies, the policy matures, or the Grace Period
  ends.��For more information, see "Grace Period," beginning on page
  28.


�


14





�


Normally,
  we will pay the surrender proceeds within thirty days after we receive your
  written request in good order at our Home Office.��We reserve the
  right to delay payment of the Cash Surrender Value arising from the Fixed
  Account for six months.
�
Generally,
  if the policy has a Cash Surrender Value in excess of the Premiums you have
  paid, the excess upon surrender will be included in your income for federal
  income tax purposes.��For more information, see " Surrendering The
  Policy," beginning on page 30.��The cash surrender value will be
  reduced by the outstanding amount of a policy loan.��For more
  information, see "Policy Loans," beginning on page 27.
�
To
  Assign
�
You
  may
  assign any rights under the policy while the Insured is alive.��If you
  make an assignment, your beneficiary�s interest will be subject to the person(s)
  to whom you have assigned rights.��Your assignment must be in writing,
  and it must be recorded at our Home Office before it will become
  effective.��Your assignment will be subject to any outstanding policy
  loans.��For more information, see "Policy Loans," beginning on page
  27.
�
Proceeds
  Upon Maturity
�
If
  the
  policy is In Force on the Maturity Date, we will pay you the maturity
  Proceeds.
�
Normally,
  we will pay the maturity Proceeds within seven days of the Maturity
  Date.��However, the payment will be postponed when: the NYSE is
  closed; the SEC restricts trading or declares an emergency; the SEC permits
  us
  to defer it for the protection of our policy owners; or the Proceeds are
  to be
  paid from the fixed account.��The maturity Proceeds will equal the
  policy's Cash Value minus any Indebtedness.��After we pay the maturity
  Proceeds, the policy is terminated.
�
We
  may
  offer to extend the Maturity Date to coincide with the Insured's death, after
  which we will pay the Proceeds to your beneficiary. If you accept this offer
  the
  policy will be endorsed so that:
�




���


no
  additional Premium payments will be
  allowed;




�




���


no
  changes to the Specified Amount will be
  allowed;




�




���


if
  you elected Death Benefit Option 2, the Death Benefit will be changed
  to
  Option 1.��For more information, see "Death Benefit Options,"
  beginning on page 23;




�




���


the
  Death Benefit will equal either 101.97% of the Cash Value if the
  Death
  Benefit is Option 1 or the Specified Amount plus the greater of
  accumulated Premiums and Cash Value if the Death Benefit is Option
  3;




�




���


100%
  of the Cash Value (for policies with Death Benefit Option 1) or
  the
  accumulated Premium payments (for policies with Death Benefit Option
  3)
  will be allocated to the policy's fixed
  account;




�




���


the
  Proceeds payable at the Insured�s death will be the greater of the Death
  Benefit or the Cash Value;




�




���


the
  Mortality and Expense charge and the Administrative charges will
  no longer
  be assessed and since the Death Benefit will be equal to the Cash
  Value if
  the Death Benefit is Option 1 or to the accumulated Premium payments
  if
  the Death Benefit is Option 3 the cost of insurance will become
  zero;
  and




�




���


the
  Maturity Date will not be extended where the policy will fail the
  definition of life insurance.




�
Reports
  And Illustrations
�
We
  will
  send you transaction confirmations.��We will also send you semi-annual
  and annual reports that show:

�


�
Errors
  Or Misstatements
�
If
  an
  error or misstatement of age was made in completing the application, then
  we
  will adjust the Death Benefit and Cash Value accordingly.
�
To
  determine the adjusted Death Benefit, we will multiply the Net Amount at
  Risk at
  the time of the Insured�s death by the ratio of the monthly cost of insurance
  actually applied in the policy month of death to the monthly cost of insurance
  that should have been applied at the true age in the policy month of
  death.��We will then add this adjusted amount that reflects the true
  age to the Cash Value of the policy at the Insured�s death.��The Cash
  Value will be adjusted to reflect the cost of insurance charges on the correct
  age from the Policy Date.
�
Incontestability
�
Except
  for intentional material misrepresentations, we will not contest payment
  of the
  Death Benefit Proceeds based on the initial Specified Amount after the policy
  has been In Force for two years from the Policy Date.��For any change
  in Specified Amount requiring evidence of insurability, we will not contest
  payment of the Death Benefit Proceeds based on such an increase after two
  years
  from the effective date of the increase.
�
If
  We Modify The Policy
�
Any
  modification or waiver of our rights or requirements under the policy must
  be in
  writing and signed by our president or corporate secretary.��No agent
  may bind us by making any promise not contained in the policy.
�
We
  may
  modify the policy, our operations, or the separate account�s operations to meet
  the requirements of any law (or regulation issued by a government agency)
  to
  which the policy, our company, or the separate account is subject.��We
  may modify the policy to assure that it continues to qualify as a life insurance
  contract under the federal tax laws.��We will notify you of all
  modifications, and we will make appropriate endorsements to the
  policy.
�

Riders

�
Riders
  are available for you to design the policy to meet your specific
  needs.��You may elect one or both of them.��However, once
  the policy is In Force, we may require further evidence of insurability to
  add a
  Rider.��Availability varies by state.��You will incur an
  additional charge for the Additional Protection (insurance) Rider so long
  as:
  the policy remains in effect and the Rider's term has not expired; until
  we have
  paid the Rider's benefit; or you decide to terminate the Rider in a written
  request to our Home Office.���For more information on the costs
  of the Additional Protection (insurance) Rider, see "In Summary: Fee Tables,"
  beginning on page 5 and "Charges," beginning on page 17.
�
Change
  Of Insured Rider
�
You
  may
  exchange the Insured for a new Insured, subject to insurability and other
  conditions. We do not charge for this Rider, but we base future policy charges
  on the characteristics of the new Insured.��You may elect this Rider
  at any time.
�
Additional
  (insurance) Protection Rider
�
This
  Rider is only available to purchase when you purchase the policy.��The
  benefit is supplemental life insurance on the Insured.��The policy
  pays a benefit, in addition to the base (non-rider) Death Benefit, to the
  beneficiary upon the Insured�s death.
�
Before
  deciding whether to purchase the Additional (insurance) Protection Rider
  it is
  important for you to know that when you purchase this Rider, the compensation
  received by your registered representative and his or her firm is less than
  when
  compared to purchasing insurance coverage under the base policy.��As a
  result of this compensation reduction, the charges assessed for the cost
  of
  insurance under this Rider will be lower for a significant period of
  time.
�
The
  benefit amount varies monthly and is based on the Death Benefit option you
  have
  chosen.��For more information, see "Death Benefit Options," on page
  23.
�
The
  Rider�s cost is determined by multiplying a monthly cost of insurance by the
  Rider�s Death Benefit amount.��For more information, see "In Summary:
  Fee Tables," beginning on page 5.��You may renew coverage annually
  until the policy Maturity Date.
�
Certain
  terms and conditions apply to the Rider including that two years after the
  Rider�s effective date we will not contest the payment of the benefit for any
  reason other than you failing to pay enough Premium to cover the cost of
  insurance for the Rider.��Also, if the Insured dies of suicide within
  two years of the Rider taking effect, we will pay the cost of insurance we
  deducted for the Rider, but not the Rider�s Death Benefit.��If the age
  of the Insured is misstated or erroneous, we will adjust the Rider�s Death
  Benefit to reflect the true age.
�


�

�



Premium

�
This
  policy does not require a scheduled payment of Premium to keep it In
  Force.��The policy will remain in effect as long as the conditions
  that cause the policy to Lapse do not exist.
�
Initial
  Premium
�
The
  amount of the initial Premium required for us to issue this policy will depend
  on the initial Specified Amount of insurance you request, the Death Benefit
  option you select, and any Riders you select.��Generally, the higher
  the required initial Specified Amount, the higher the initial Premium will
  be.��Similarly, because Death Benefit Options Two and Three provide
  for a potentially greater Death Benefit than Death Benefit Option One, Death
  Benefit Options Two and Three may require a higher amount of
  Premiums.��Also, the age, health, and activities of the Insured will
  affect our determination of the risk of issuing the policy.��In
  general, the greater this risk, the higher the initial Premium will
  be.
�
Whether
  we will issue full insurance coverage depends on the Insured meeting all
  underwriting requirements, you paying the initial Premium, and our delivery
  of
  the policy while the Insured is alive.��We will not delay delivery of
  the policy to increase the likelihood that the Insured is not still
  living.��Depending on the outcome of our underwriting process, more or
  less Premium may be necessary for us to issue the policy.��We also
  retain the right to not issue the policy.��If we exercise this right,
  we will return your payment within two business days.
�
You
  may
  pay the initial Premium to our Home Office or to our authorized
  representative.��The initial Premium payment must be at least $50 per
  policy.��The initial Premium payment will not be applied to the policy
  until the underwriting process is complete.
�
Subsequent
  Premiums
�
You
  may
  make additional Premium payments at any time while the policy is In Force,
  subject to the following:
�




���


We
  may require satisfactory evidence of insurability before accepting
  any
  additional Premium payment that results in an increase in the policy�s Net
  Amount at Risk.��Whether we exercise this right depends on: the
  length of time since the Policy Date; the standard underwriting
  criteria
  for the amount of insurance after the requested increase; the number
  of
  policies owned by the policy owner; and the degree of uniformity
  with
  respect to the requested increases across the policies owned by
  the policy
  owner.��The longer the period, the greater the difference
  between the underwriting class at the time of issue and at the
  time of the
  increase, and the less uniform the changes across all policies
  you own,
  the more likely we will be to exercise this right.��If we do not
  exercise our right to refuse a Premium payment which increases
  our Net
  Amount at Risk, we do not waive our right to refuse subsequent
  Premium
  payments which increase our Net Amount at
  Risk.




�




���


We
  will refund Premium payments that exceed the applicable Premium
  limit
  established by the IRS to qualify the policy as a contract for
  life
  insurance.��As discussed in the "Taxes" section of this
  prospectus, additional Premium payments or other changes to the
  policy may
  jeopardize the policy's non-modified endowment status.��We will
  monitor Premiums paid and other policy transactions and will notify
  you
  when the policy�s non-modified endowment contract status is in jeopardy;
  and




�




���


We
  may require that policy indebtedness be repaid prior to accepting
  any
  additional Premium payments.��Some, but not all, of the
  situations when we might exercise this right include when your
  policy
  loans exceed 90% of the cash value, when the Premium payment would
  result
  in an increase in the Net Amount at Risk, or when a Premium payment
  may
  alter the character of the policy for tax purposes.��We will
  tell you that we intend to apply the money you have sent us to
  loan
  repayment rather than as a Premium payment before processing the
  transaction.




�
If
  you
  decide to make a subsequent Premium payment, you must send it to our Home
  Office.��Each Premium payment must be at least $50 per
  policy.
�

Charges

�
Please
  read and consider the following, which we intend to be an amplification (but
  it
  may also be duplicative), in conjunction with the fee tables, and the
  accompanying footnotes, appearing earlier in the prospectus.��See "In
  Summary: Fee Tables," beginning on page 5.��Also, see the policy,
  including the Policy Data Page, and the Riders, for more
  information.
�
We
  will
  make deductions under the policy to compensate us for: the services and benefits
  we provide; the costs and expenses we incur; and the risks we
  assume.��Every time you make a Premium payment, we will charge against
  that Premium payment a premium load, which is composed of the sales load
  and
  premium taxes.��We will deduct all other charges from the policy�s
  cash value (rather than a Premium payment), except for mortality and expense
  risk.��We will only deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from
  the Cash Value of the Sub-Account portfolios, and we will only deduct the
  loan
  amount interest charge from the Cash Value of the loan account.
�
�
�


�


17





�


�
�
There
  are
  also charges associated with the Sub-Account portfolios.��While you
  will not pay them directly, they will affect the value of the assets in the
  Sub-Account portfolios.��On a daily basis, the manager of each mutual
  fund that comprises the policy�s available variable investment options deducts
  operating charges from that mutual fund�s assets before calculating the
  NAV.��(We use NAV to calculate the value of your corresponding
  Sub-Account portfolio allocation in Units.)��More detail about these
  charges is contained in the prospectus for the mutual fund.
�
Premium
  Load (Charge)
�
This
  charge partially recoups sales expenses and premium taxes.��After this
  charge is deducted, the remaining premium is invested in the investment options
  you elect.
�
The
  Premium load is calculated based on the policy�s target premium, which is
  determined in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.��The target
  premium is a specified percentage of the maximum Premium allowed under the
  Code
  to qualify the policy as life insurance.��Your policy data page
  indicates your specific target premium.��The premium load calculation
  applicable to your policy depends on the date that you applied for or purchased
  the policy, and the total premium paid to the policy in the first policy
  year
  (the �First Year Premium�).

Partial
  Surrender Fee
�
You
  may
  request a partial surrender after the first year from the Policy Date, and
  we
  may charge a partial surrender fee of the lesser of $25 or 2% of the surrendered
  amount to compensate us for the administrative costs in calculating and
  generating the surrender amount.��Currently we do not assess this
  charge.
�
Cost
  Of Insurance
�
We
  will
  determine this charge by multiplying the current (non-rider) monthly cost
  of
  insurance rate by the Net Amount at Risk for the base portion of the Specified
  Amount.��This charge compensates us for providing insurance protection
  under the policy.
�
We
  base
  the cost of insurance rates on our expectancies of future mortality and
  expense.��The current cost of insurance rate will vary by demographic
  factors such as: age; tobacco use; duration since issue; Specified Amount;
  underwriting class; and any substandard ratings.��The current cost of
  insurance charges are based on future expectations for factors such as:
  mortality;


�


19





�


investment
  earnings; persistency; expenses; and taxes.��Any changes in these
  expectations may result in increased cost of insurance charges for your policy.
  If so, your policy's Cash Value will be adversely affected in future
  years.
�
We
  may
  underwrite your policy on a non-medical basis that may result in a higher
  cost
  of insurance charge.��Non-medical underwriting means that a physical
  examination to obtain medical information on the proposed Insured is not
  required to issue the policy.��The higher cost of insurance charge
  would compensate us for assuming additional mortality risk as a result of
  issuing without the information that results from medical
  underwriting.
�
We
  may
  use a separate cost of insurance rate for the initial Specified Amount and
  any
  increase.��Periodically, we will reevaluate the current base
  (non-rider) cost of insurance rates based on our expectations about future
  experience.��Any changes in the current cost of insurance rates will
  be uniformly applied to Insureds of the same underwriting rate
  class.
�
Mortality
  And Expense Risk
�
The
  charge compensates us for assuming risks associated with mortality and expense
  costs, and we may profit from it.��The mortality risk is that the
  Insured does not live as long as expected.��The expense risk is that
  the costs of issuing and administering the policy are more than
  expected.��This charge is guaranteed not to exceed 0.75% of the
  policy's Cash Value, on an annualized basis.��The current charge,
  which applies to policies with applications signed on or after January 3,
2006,
  declines over time, as follows:
�





Charge
  for
policy
  years 1-4


Charge

Policy
  Loan Interest
�
We
  charge
  interest on the amount of an outstanding policy loan, at a rate no greater
  than
  3.75% per annum, which will accrue daily and become due and payable at the
  end
  of each year from the Policy Date or at the time you take an additional
  loan.��If left unpaid, we will add it to the policy's outstanding
  indebtedness.
�
As
  collateral or security for repayment, we will transfer an equal amount of
  Cash
  Value to the policy loan account on which interest will accrue and be credited
  daily. The minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate is stated on the Policy
  Data Page.
�
Administrative
�
The
  maximum guaranteed administrative charge is $10, but we currently are charging
  $5.��This charge reimburses us for the costs of maintaining the
  policy, including accounting and record keeping.
�
Additional
  (insurance) Protection Rider
�
This
  charge compensates us for providing supplemental life insurance on the
  Insured.��We will determine this charge by multiplying the Rider�s
  current cost of insurance rate by the Net Amount at Risk for the Rider portion
  of the Specified Amount.
�
We
  base
  the additional protection cost of insurance rate on our expectation as to
  the
  Insured's mortality.��The additional protection cost of insurance rate
  will vary by: the Insured's age; tobacco use; duration since issue; underwriting
  class; any substandard ratings; and the Specified Amount of the
  Rider.��Periodically, we will reevaluate the Rider�s current cost of
  insurance rates based on our expectations about future
  experience.��Any changes in the current cost of insurance rates will
  be uniformly applied to Insureds of the same underwriting rate
  class.��Any changes in these expectations may result in increased cost
  of insurance charges for the Rider.
�
A
  Note on Charges
�
During
  a
  policy's early years, the expenses we incur in distributing and establishing
  the
  policy exceed the deductions we take.��Nevertheless, we expect to make
  a profit over time because variable life insurance is intended to be a long-term
  financial investment.��Accordingly, we have designed the policy with
  features and investment options that we believe support and
encourage
  long-term ownership.


�


20





�


�
We
  make
  many assumptions and account for many economic and financial factors when
  we
  establish the policy's fees and charges.��The following is a
  discussion of some of the factors that are relevant to the policy's pricing
  structure.
�
Distribution,
  Promotional, and Sales Expenses.��Distribution, promotional and
  sales expenses include amounts we pay to broker-dealer firms as commissions,
  expense allowances and marketing allowances.��We refer to these
  expenses collectively as "total compensation." The maximum total compensation
  we
  pay to any broker-dealer firm in conjunction with policy sales is 99% of
  first
  year premiums and 3% of renewal premium after the first year.
�
We
  have
  the ability to customize the total compensation package of our broker-dealer
  firms.��We may vary the form of compensation paid or the amounts paid
  as commission, expense allowance or marketing allowance; however, the total
  compensation will not exceed the maximum (99% of first year premiums and
  3% of
  renewal premium after the first year).��Commission may also be paid as
  an asset-based amount instead of a premium based amount.��If an
  asset-based commission is paid, it will not exceed 0.25% of the non-loaned
  cash
  value per year.
�
The
  actual amount and/or forms of total compensation we pay depend on factors
  such
  as the level of premiums we receive from respective broker-dealer firms and
  the
  scope of services they provide.��Some broker-dealer firms may not
  receive maximum total compensation.
�
Individual
  registered representatives typically receive a portion of the commissions/total
  compensation we pay, depending on their arrangement with their broker-dealer
  firm.��If you would like to know the exact compensation arrangement
  associated with this product, you should consult your registered
  representative.
�
Information
  on Underlying Mutual Fund Payments
�
Our
  Relationship with the Underlying Mutual Funds.��The
  underlying mutual funds incur expenses each time they sell, administer, or
  redeem their shares.��The separate account aggregates policy owner
  purchase, redemption, and transfer requests and submits net or aggregated
  purchase/redemption requests to each underlying mutual fund
  daily.��The separate account (not the policy owners) is the underlying
  mutual fund shareholder.��When the separate account aggregates
  transactions, the underlying mutual fund does not incur the expense of
  processing individual transactions it would normally incur if it sold its
  shares
  directly to the public.��We incur these expenses instead.
�
We
  also
  incur the distribution costs of selling the policy (as discussed above),
  which
  benefit the underlying mutual funds by providing policy owners with Sub-Account
  options that correspond to the underlying mutual funds.��
�
An
  investment adviser or subadviser of an underlying mutual fund or its affiliates
  may provide us or our affiliates with wholesaling services that assist in
  the
  distribution of the policy and may pay us or our affiliates to participate
  in
  educational and/or marketing activities.��These activities may provide
  the adviser or subadviser (or their affiliates) with increased exposure to
  persons involved in the distribution of the policy.
�
Types
  of Payments We Receive.��In light of the above, the
  underlying mutual funds or their affiliates make certain payments to us or
  our
  affiliates (the �payments�).��The amount of these payments is
  typically based on a percentage of assets invested in the underlying mutual
  funds attributable to the policies and other variable policies we and our
  affiliates issue, but in some cases may involve a flat fee.��These
  payments may be used by us for any corporate purpose, which include reducing
  the
  prices of the policies, paying expenses that we or our affiliates incur in
  promoting, marketing, and administering the policies and the underlying mutual
  funds, and achieving a profit.
�
We
  or our
  affiliates receive the following types of payments:
�




���


Underlying
  mutual fund 12b-1 fees, which are deducted from underlying mutual
  fund
  assets;




�




���


Sub-transfer
  agent fees or fees pursuant to administrative service plans adopted
  by the
  underlying mutual fund, which may be deducted from underlying mutual
  fund
  assets; and




�




���


Payments
  by an underlying mutual fund�s adviser or subadviser (or its
  affiliates).��Such payments may be derived, in whole or in part,
  from the advisory fee, which is deducted from underlying mutual
  fund
  assets and is reflected in mutual fund
  charges.




�
Furthermore,
  we benefit from assets invested in our affiliated underlying mutual funds
  (i.e., Nationwide Variable Insurance Trust) because our affiliates also
  receive compensation from the underlying mutual funds for investment advisory,
  administrative, transfer agency, distribution, and/or other
  services.��Thus, we may receive more revenue with respect to
  affiliated underlying mutual funds than unaffiliated underlying mutual
  funds.
�
We
  took
  into consideration the anticipated payments from the underlying mutual funds
  when we determined the charges imposed under the policies (apart from fees
  and
  expenses imposed by the underlying mutual funds).��Without these
  payments, we would have imposed higher charges under the
  policy.


�


21





�


�
Amount
  of Payments We Receive.��For the year ended December 31, 2006,
  the underlying mutual fund payments we and our affiliates received from the
  underlying mutual funds did not exceed 0.50% (as a percentage of the average
  daily net assets invested in the underlying mutual funds) offered through
  this
  policy or other variable policies that we and our affiliates
  issue.��Payments from investment advisers or subadvisers to
  participate in educational and/or marketing activities have not been taken
  into
  account in this percentage.
�
Most
  underlying mutual funds or their affiliates have agreed to make payments
  to us
  or our affiliates, although the applicable percentages may vary from underlying
  mutual fund to underlying mutual fund and some may not make any payments
  at
  all.��Because the amount of the actual payments we or our affiliates
  receive depends on the assets of the underlying mutual funds attributable
  to the
  policy, we and our affiliates may receive higher payments from underlying
  mutual
  funds with lower percentages (but greater assets) than from underlying mutual
  funds that have higher percentages (but fewer assets).
�
For
  additional information related to the amount of payments Nationwide receives,
  go
  to www.nationwide.com.
�
Identification
  of Underlying Mutual Funds.���We may consider several
  criteria when identifying the underlying mutual funds, including some or
  all of
  the following:��investment objectives, investment process, investment
  performance, risk characteristics, investment capabilities, experience and
  resources, investment consistency, and fund expenses.��Another factor
  we consider during the identification process is whether the underlying mutual
  fund�s adviser or subadviser is one of our affiliates or whether the underlying
  mutual fund, its adviser, its subadviser(s), or an affiliate will make payments
  to us or our affiliates.
�
There
  may
  be underlying mutual funds with lower fees, as well as other variable policies
  that offer underlying mutual funds with lower fees.��You should
  consider all of the fees and charges of the policy in relation to its features
  and benefits when making your decision to invest.��Please note that
  higher policy and underlying mutual fund fees and charges have a direct effect
  on your investment performance.
�

The
  Death Benefit

�
Calculation
  Of The Death Benefit Proceeds
�
We
  will
  calculate the Death Benefit and pay it to the beneficiary when we receive
  at our
  Home Office proof that the Insured has died, as well as other customary
  information.��The Death Benefit may be subject to an adjustment if
  death occurs within the contestability period or at any time if there has
  been a
  material misstatement.
�
While
  the
  policy is In Force, the Death Benefit will never be less than the Specified
  Amount. The Death Benefit will depend on which option you have chosen and
  the
  tax test (as described in the following "Minimum Required Death Benefit"
  section) you have elected.��Also, the Death Benefit may vary with the
  Cash Value of the policy, which depends on investment
  performance.��You may choose one of three Death Benefit
  options.��Not all Death Benefit options are available in all
  states.��If you do not elect a Death Benefit, the policy�s Death
  Benefit will be Option 1.
�
For
  policies issued after the later of May 1, 2002 or the date we are authorized
  to
  issue policies with a maximum Death Benefit within your state, we reserve
  the
  right to limit the amount of insurance under any policy to the maximum Death
  Benefit.��Currently, the maximum Death Benefit is equal to the sum of
  the Cash Value and the lesser of (i) 200% of the Specified Amount on the
  policy
  issue date and (ii) $8,000,000.��We may increase the maximum Death
  Benefit at our sole discretion.
�
We
  will
  calculate the Death Benefit on the monthly anniversary and upon the death
  of the
  Insured.��If the calculation exceeds the maximum Death Benefit, we
  reserve the right to pay to you a pre-death distribution to reduce the Cash
  Value so that the Death Benefit will not exceed the sum of the Cash Value
  and
  the lesser of (i) 180% of the Specified Amount on the policy issue date and
  (ii)
  $7,200,000.��If Death Benefit Option 3 is applicable and the
  accumulated Premium account is greater than the Cash Value, we reserve the
  right
  to reduce the amount previously credited to the accumulated Premium account
  to
  an amount equal to 90% of the Cash Value immediately before the
  distribution.��For example, if at the time of the pre-death
  distribution, your Cash Value is $100 and your accumulated Premium account
  is
  $102, we would reduce your accumulated Premium account by $12 to $90 (i.e.,
  90%
  of the Cash Value). The accumulated Premium account will not become less
  than
  zero because of a pre-death distribution.
�
The
  maximum Death Benefit may, under certain circumstances, curtail the flexibility
  that the policy affords you. For example, the policy's Cash Value may increase
  at a rate that outpaces the ratio of Cash Value to life insurance permitted
  under the Internal Revenue Code.��In some instances, you and we may
  address this situation by increasing the Specified Amount of insurance so
  that
  the policy's ratio of Cash Value to life insurance is readjusted to comply
  with
  the tax code definition.��If, however, an increase in the Specified
  Amount would cause the Death Benefit to exceed the maximum Death Benefit,
  then
  this method of achieving compliance with the tax code definition of life
  insurance may not be available.
�
We
  will
  notify you that a pre-death distribution and/or a reduction in the accumulated
  Premium account has been generated.��We will send this notice no later
  than thirty days after we become aware that the maximum Death Benefit has
  been
  exceeded.


�


22





�


�
Taxes
  arising from the pre-death distribution, if any, are your
  responsibility.��We urge you to confer with your tax adviser regarding
  tax implications of receiving a pre-death distribution prior to the purchase
  of
  this policy.
�
Death
  Benefit Options
�
There
  are
  the three Death Benefit options under the policy.��You may choose one.
  If you do not choose one of the following Death Benefit options, we will
  assume
  that you intended to choose Death Benefit Option 1.
�




���


Option
  1




�
The
  Death
  Benefit will be the greater of the Specified Amount or the minimum required
  Death Benefit.
�




���


Option
  2




�
The
  Death
  Benefit will be the greater of the Specified Amount plus the Cash Value as
  of
  the date of death (which will vary with the investment performance), or the
  minimum required Death Benefit.
�




���


Option
  3




�
The
  Death
  Benefit will be the greater of the sum of the Specified Amount on the date
  of
  death and the accumulated Premium account (which consists of all Premium
  payments accumulated to the date of the death less partial surrenders
  accumulated to the date of death) or the minimum required Death
  Benefit.
�
The
  Proceeds payable upon the death of the Insured are equal to Death Benefit
  reduced by policy indebtedness and unpaid charges and increased by any insurance
  provided by riders.��Also, for policies to which an "other amount paid
  at surrender" is available as of the time the Proceeds become payable may
  receive an additional payment.��For more information, see "Other
  Amounts Paid At Surrender," beginning on page 24.��This additional
  payment will be based on the other amount paid at surrender at the time the
  Proceeds become payable.
�
The
  Minimum Required Death Benefit
�
Each
  death benefit option has a minimum required Death Benefit.��The
  minimum required Death Benefit is the lowest Death Benefit that will qualify
  the
  policy as life insurance under Section 7702 of the Code.
�
The
  tax
  tests for life insurance generally require that the policy have a significant
  element of life insurance and not be primarily an investment
  vehicle.
�
At
  the
  time we issue the policy, you irrevocably elect one of the following tests
  to
  qualify the policy as life insurance under Section 7702 of the
  Code:
�




���


the
  cash value accumulation test; or




�




���


the
  guideline premium/cash value corridor
  test.




�
The
  cash
  value accumulation test determines the minimum required Death Benefit by
  multiplying the account value by a percentage set out in the federal tax
  regulations to the Code. The percentages depend upon the Insured's age, sex
  and
  underwriting classification.
�
Under
  the
  cash value accumulation test, there is no limit to the amount that may be
  paid
  in Premiums as long as there is sufficient death benefit in relation to the
  account value at all times.
�
The
  guideline Premium/Cash Value corridor test determines the minimum required
  Death
  Benefit by comparing the Death Benefit to an applicable percentage of the
  Cash
  Value.��These percentages are set out in the Code, but the percentage
  varies only by the Attained Age of the Insured.
�
Regardless
  of which test you elect, we will monitor compliance to assure that the policy
  meets the statutory definition of life insurance for federal tax
  purposes.��As a result, the death Proceeds payable under a policy
  should be excludable from gross income of the beneficiary for federal income
  tax
  purposes.
�
If
  you do
  not elect a test, we will assume that you intended to elect the cash value
  accumulation test.
�
Changes
  In The Death Benefit Option
�
After
  the
  first policy year, you may elect to change the Death Benefit option under
  the
  policy from either Option 1 to Option 2, or from Option 2 to Option
  1.��You may not change from or to Option 3.��We will permit
  only one change of Death Benefit option per policy year.��The
  effective date of a change will be the monthly anniversary date following
  the
  date we approve the change.
�
For
  any
  change in the Death Benefit option to become effective, the Cash Surrender
  Value
  after the change must be sufficient to keep the policy In Force for at least
  three months.


�


23





�


�
We
  will
  adjust the Specified Amount so that the difference between the Death Benefit
  and
  the Cash Value (i.e., the Net Amount at Risk) remains constant before and
  after
  the Death Benefit option change.��Because your Net Amount at Risk is
  the same before and after the reduction, reducing the Specified Amount by
  itself does not alter the policy�s cost of insurance.��The
  policy�s charges going forward, however, will be based on a new Specified Amount
  that will change the calculation of those charges.��Depending on
  changes in factors such as the Cash Value, these charges may increase or
  decrease after the reduction.
�
Where
  the
  policy owner has selected the guideline premium/cash value corridor test,
  a
  change in Death Benefit option will not be permitted if it results in the
  total
  Premiums paid exceeding the maximum Premium limitations under Section 7702
  of
  the Code.
�
Suicide
�
If
  the
  Insured dies by suicide, while sane or insane, within two years from the
  Policy
  Date, we will pay no more than the sum of the Premiums paid, less any
  indebtedness, and less any partial surrenders.��If the Insured dies by
  suicide, while sane or insane, within two years from the date we accept an
  application for an increase in the Specified Amount, we will pay no more
  than
  the Death Benefit associated with the initial Specified Amount, plus the
  cost of
  insurance charges associated with the increase in Specified Amount.
�

Surrenders

�
Full
  Surrender
�
You
  may
  surrender the policy for the cash surrender value at any time while the Insured
  is alive.��We calculate the cash surrender value based on the policy's
  cash value.��For more information, see "Cash Value," beginning on page
  10.��To derive the cash surrender value, we will deduct from the cash
  value, any due and payable periodic charges and Indebtedness.��The
  effective date of a surrender will coincide with the date on which we receive
  the policy and your written request at our Home Office.��We reserve
  the right to postpone payment of that portion of the cash surrender value
  attributable to the fixed account for up to six months.
�
Other
  Amounts Paid At Surrender
�
For
  a
  policy purchased by a corporation or another entity, an amount may be paid
  by us
  in addition to the policy�s Cash Surrender Value if, during a limited, specified
  time period, the policy is completely surrendered and the surrender Proceeds
  are
  paid directly to the policy owner as of the date of issue.��We will
  inform you of the availability of this arrangement at the time you apply
  for the
  policy.��This payment will not be made from the policy, but is a
  separate obligation of Nationwide.��This additional payment does not
  apply to a partial surrender, to a policy loan, or to a complete surrender
  for
  which you instruct us to pay the Proceeds to a party other than the policy
  owner
  as of the date of issue. An additional surrender payment may also be available
  to an individually owned policy if the Premiums are paid by a corporate sponsor
  to whom the individual has assigned rights under the policy.
�
The
  amount, duration, and availability of additional surrender
  payments��may vary based on a number of factors,
  including:
�




���


the
  number of Insureds;




�




���


the
  nature of the relationship among individual
  Insureds;




�




���


the
  purpose for which the policies are being
  purchased;




�




���


the
  expected persistency of the policies;
  and




�




���


any
  other circumstances which are rationally related to an expected
  reduction
  in acquisition or administrative
  costs.




�
We
  will
  pay surrender payments that are in addition to the policy�s Cash Surrender Value
  from our general account.��We urge you to consult with your
  tax adviser about the tax treatment of additional surrender
  payments.��The criteria for additional surrender payments may
  change from time to time.��Additional surrender payments will be
  determined in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory to policy
  owners.
�
Partial
  Surrender
�
After
  the
  policy has been In Force for one year, you may request a partial surrender
  by
  sending a written request to the address on the first page of this
  prospectus.��We reserve the right to limit partial surrenders to one
  per year.
�
We
  permit
  partial surrenders if the partial surrender satisfies the following
  requirements:
�




���


the
  minimum partial surrender is $500;




�
�


�


24





�


�
�




���


a
  partial surrender may not cause the total Specified Amount to be
  reduced
  below the minimum Specified Amount shown on the Policy Data
  Page;




�




���


the
  maximum amount of a partial surrender is the Cash Surrender Value
  less the
  greater of $500 or three monthly deductions;
  and




�




���


after
  the partial surrender, the policy continues to qualify as life
  insurance.




�
Reduction
  Of Specified Amount On A Partial Surrender
�
When
  a
  partial surrender is made, we reduce the Cash Value by the amount of the
  partial
  surrender.��If the policy assets are held in more than one
  Sub-Account, we effect the partial surrender proportionately from the assets
  in
  each Sub-Account at the time of the partial surrender. We will distribute
  amounts from the fixed account only when there are insufficient amounts in
  the
  Sub-Accounts.
�
When
  you
  take a partial surrender, ordinarily we will reduce the Specified Amount
  so that
  the Net Amount at Risk does not increase.��Because your Net Amount at
  Risk is the same before and after the reduction, a partial surrender by
  itself does not alter the policy�s cost of insurance.��The
  policy�s charges going forward, however, will be based on a new Specified Amount
  that will change the calculation of those charges.��Depending on
  changes in factors such as the fluctuation in the policy�s Cash Value, these
  charges may increase or decrease after the reduction in Specified
  Amount.
�
However,
  we will not decrease the Specified Amount by more than the partial surrender
  amount reduced by any preferred partial surrenders.��A preferred
  partial surrender is a partial surrender that:
�




���


occurs
  before the 15th policy anniversary;
  and




�




���


when
  added to any prior preferred policy surrenders in that same policy
  year,
  it does not exceed 10% of the Cash Surrender Value as of the beginning
  of
  the policy year.




�
Any
  reduction we make to the Specified Amount will be made in the following
  order:
�




���


against
  the most recent increase in the Specified
  Amount;




�




���


against
  the next most recent increases in the Specified Amount in succession;
  and




�




���


against
  the Specified Amount under the original
  application.




�
While
  we
  reserve the right to deduct a partial surrender fee, we currently deduct
  none.��Certain partial surrenders may result in currently taxable
  income and tax penalties.��Also, partial surrenders could cause your
  policy to become a "modified endowment contract" under the Code, which would
  change the income tax treatment of any distributions from the
  policy.��For more information, see "Periodic Withdrawals, Non-Periodic
  Withdrawals And Loans," beginning on page 29.
�

The
  Payout Options

�
You
  have
  a number of options of receiving Proceeds, besides in a lump sum, which you
  may
  elect upon application.��We will pay the Proceeds from our general
  account.��If you do not make an election, when the Insured dies, the
  beneficiary may do so.��If the beneficiary does not make an election,
  we will pay the Proceeds in a lump sum. Normally, we will make the lump sum
  payment within seven days (30 days if the Proceeds are paid because of the
  Insured�s death) after we receive your written request at our Home
  Office.��We reserve the right to delay for six months from the date of
  your request the payment of any surrender Proceeds allocated to the fixed
  account.��Also, we will postpone any payment of Proceeds on the days
  we are unable to price Sub-Account Units.��For more information, see
  "Valuation of Accumulation Units," beginning on page 9.��To elect more
  than one payout option, you must apportion at least $2,000 per option, which
  would amount to a payment, at specified intervals, of at least
  $20.��.��At any time before the Proceeds become payable, you
  may request to change your payout option in writing to our Home
  Office.��Changing the beneficiary of the policy will revoke the
  settlement options in effect at that time.��Proceeds are neither
  assignable nor subject to claims of creditors or legal process.
�
Please
  note that for the remainder of "The Payout Options" section only, "you" means
  the person we are obligated to pay.
�
Interest
  Income
�
You
  keep
  the Proceeds with us to earn interest at a specified rate.��The
  Proceeds can be paid at the end of twelve-, six-, three- or one-month
  intervals.��You may withdraw any outstanding balance by making a
  written request of us at our Home Office.��We will pay interest on the
  outstanding balance at a rate of at least 2.5% per year.��We will
  determine annually if we will pay any interest in excess of
  2.5%.��Upon your death, we will pay any outstanding balance to your
  estate.

�


�
Income
  For A Fixed Period
�
You
  keep
  the Proceeds with us, but are paid at specified intervals over a number of
  years
  (no more than 30).��Each payment consists of a portion of the Proceeds
  plus interest at a guaranteed rate.��The Proceeds can be paid at the
  beginning of twelve-, six-, three- or one-month intervals.��You may
  withdraw any outstanding balance by making a written request of us to our
  Home
  Office.��We will pay interest at an annually determined rate of at
  least 2.5% per year.��We will determine annually if we will pay any
  interest in excess of 2.5%.��Upon your death, we will pay any
  outstanding balance to your estate.
�
Life
  Income With Payments Guaranteed
�
We
  pay
  you the Proceeds at specified intervals for a guaranteed period (10, 15 or
  20
  years), and, then, for the rest of your life.��The Proceeds can be
  paid at the beginning of twelve-, six-, three- or one-month
  intervals.��As the payments are based on your lifetime, you cannot
  withdraw any amount you designate to this option after payments begin and
  if you
  live longer than the guaranteed period, payments will cease upon your
  death.��During the guaranteed period, we will pay interest on the
  outstanding balance at a rate of at least 2.5% per year.��We will
  determine annually if we will pay any interest in excess of 2.5%.��If
  you die before the guaranteed period has elapsed, we will make the remaining
  payments to your estate.��If you die after the guaranteed period has
  elapsed, we will make no payments to your estate.
�
Fixed
  Income For Varying Periods
�
You
  keep
  the Proceeds with us, but are paid a fixed amount at specified
  intervals.��The total amount payable each year may not be less than 5%
  of the original Proceeds.��The Proceeds can be paid at the beginning
  of twelve-, six-, three- or one-month intervals.��You may withdraw any
  outstanding balance by making a written request of us at our Home
  Office.��We will pay interest on the outstanding balance at a rate of
  at least 2.5% per year.��We will determine annually if we will pay any
  interest in excess of 2.5%.��Upon your death, we will pay any
  outstanding balance to your estate.
�
Joint
  And Survivor Life
�
We
  pay
  you the Proceeds in equal payments at specified intervals for the life of
  the
  payee who lives longer.��The Proceeds can be paid at the beginning of
  twelve-, six-, three- or one-month intervals.��As the payments are
  based on your lifetime, you cannot withdraw any amount you designate to this
  option after payments begin and, payments will cease upon��the death
  of the payee who lives longer.��We will make no payments to the last
  surviving payee's estate.
�
Alternate
  Life Income
�
We
  use
  the Proceeds to purchase an annuity with the payee as annuitant.��The
  amount payable will be 102% of our current individual immediate annuity purchase
  rate on the date you choose this settlement option.��The Proceeds can
  be paid at the end of twelve-, six-, three- or one-month
  intervals.��As the payments are based on your lifetime, you cannot
  withdraw any amount you designate to this option after payments begin and
  payments will cease upon your death.

Dollar
  Cost Averaging
�
You
  may
  elect to participate in a dollar cost averaging program.��Dollar cost
  averaging is an investment strategy designed to reduce the investment risks
  associated with market fluctuations.��The strategy spreads the
  allocation of your Premium among the Sub-Account portfolios and the fixed
  investment option over a period of time to allow you to potentially reduce
  the
  risk of investing most of your Premium into the Sub-Accounts at a time when
  prices are high.
�
There
  is
  no additional charge for dollar cost averaging.��A dollar cost
  averaging program may not be available in all states.��We do not
  assure the success of these strategies; success depends on market
  trends.��We cannot guarantee that dollar cost averaging will result in
  a profit or protect against loss.��You should carefully consider your
  financial ability to continue these programs over a long enough period of
  time
  to purchase Units when their value is low, as well as when it is
  high.��We may modify, suspend or discontinue these programs at any
  time.��We will notify you in writing 30 days before we do
  this.
�
On
  a
  monthly basis (or another frequency we may permit), a specified dollar amount
  of
  your Premium is systematically and automatically transferred from the fixed
  account to a Sub-Account portfolio.��With dollar cost averaging, you
  may also have Premium transferred from the Nationwide NVIT Money Market
  Fund.
�
With
  dollar cost averaging, we will continue to process transfers until there
  is no
  more value left in the fixed account or the originating mutual
  fund(s).��You may also instruct us in writing to stop the
  transfers.��If you have Premium transferred from the fixed account,
  the amount must be no more than 1/30 of the fixed account value at the time
  you
  elect to participate in the program.��Either you elect to participate
  in the dollar cost averaging program upon application or by submitting an
  election form before the beginning of the month.

Policy
  Loans

�
After
  the
  expiration of the free-look period and while the policy is In Force, you
  may
  take an advance of money from the Cash Value otherwise only available upon
  surrender or maturity, or upon payment of the Death Benefit.��We call
  this advance a policy loan.��You may increase your risk of Lapse if
  you take a policy loan.��There also may be adverse tax
  consequences.��You should obtain competent tax advice before you
  decide to take a policy loan.
�
Loan
  Amount And Interest
�
The
  minimum policy loan you may take is $500.��You may take no more than
  the maximum loan value which equals (1) plus (2) plus (3), where:
�




(1)��


is
  90% of the Sub-Account portfolios;




�




(2)��


is
  100% of the fixed account; and




�




(3)��


is
  100% of the loan account.




�
We
  guarantee the effective annual interest rate will not exceed
  3.75%.��Interest will accrue daily and is due and payable at the end
  of each policy year or at the time of an additional loan.��If left
  unpaid, it will be added to the outstanding balance of your policy
  loan.
�
For
  policies issued on or after September 9, 2002, we expect to charge an effective
  annual interest rate of 3.70% on the outstanding balance of your policy loan
  for
  the first fifteen policy years, 3.45% for policy years 16 through 30, and
  3.00%
  thereafter.
�
For
  policies issued prior to September 9, 2002, we expect to charge an effective
  annual interest rate of 3.40% on the outstanding balance of your policy loan
  for
  the first four policy years, 3.25% for policy years 5 through 20, and 3.10%
  thereafter.
�
Collateral
�
As
  collateral or security, we will transfer to our loan account an amount equal
  to
  the amount of the policy loan.��We will only make a transfer from the
  fixed investment option if the loan amount exceeds 90% of the Cash Value
  you
  have allocated to Sub-Account portfolios. We will credit interest to the
  collateral at an annual effective rate no less than the stated interest
  crediting rate on the Policy Data Page.
�
We
  will
  credit interest to the collateral at an annual effective rate no less than
  the
  stated interest crediting rate on the Policy Data Page.
�
Repayment
�
You
  may
  repay all or part of a policy loan at any time while your policy is In Force
  during the Insured�s lifetime.��The minimum repayment is
  $50.��While your policy loan is outstanding, we will credit all
  payments you make as Premium payments, unless you provide written notice
  that
  they are to be applied as loan repayments.��If you do not specify any
  Sub-Account portfolios to allocate loan repayments, we will transfer the
  amount
  from the policy loan account to the Sub-Account portfolios and fixed investment
  option based on your allocations as of the date of repayment.
�
Net
  Effect Of Loans
�
The
  amount we transfer to our loan account as collateral for a policy loan will
  neither be affected by the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts, nor
  credited with the interest rates accruing on the fixed account.��For
  more information, see "In Summary: Fee Tables," in particular, the footnotes,
  beginning on page 5.��Whether repaid, a policy loan affects the
  policy, the loan account value, the net Cash Surrender Value and the Death
  Benefit.��Repaying a policy loan causes the Death Benefit and net Cash
  Surrender Value to increase by the repayment amount.��A policy loan
  will affect the policy account value even if repaid because we credit these
  amounts with an interest rate we declare rather than with a rate of return
  that
  reflects the investment performance of the separate account.
�

Lapse

�
So
  long
  as your policy�s Cash Surrender Value is enough to cover the monthly deduction
  of charges on each monthly anniversary date, the policy will remain In
  Force.��The Cash Surrender Value could be below the amount of a
  monthly deduction because you have not paid enough Premium into the policy
  or
  because Investment Experience has decreased the Cash Surrender Value, or
  both.��The policy will remain In Force during the Grace
  Period.
�
Stated
  another way, this policy will Lapse when the Grace Period ends before you
  make a
  required Premium payment as stated in a notice.


�


27





�


�
Grace
  Period
�
If
  the
  Cash Surrender Value on a monthly anniversary date is not sufficient to cover
  the current monthly deduction, then a Grace Period begins.
�
We
  will
  send you a notice at the start of the Grace Period to the address on the
  application or another address you have specified.��The notice will
  state the amount of Premium required to avoid lapsing the policy. The amount
  of
  Premium specified in the notice will equal the lesser of at least 3 times
  the
  current monthly deduction.��The Grace Period will end 61 days after
  the day the notice is mailed.��If we do not receive sufficient Premium
  by the end of the Grace Period, the policy including all Riders you have
  selected will Lapse without value.��The Grace Period will not alter
  the operation of the policy or the payment of Proceeds.
�
Reinstatement
�
If
  the
  Grace Period ends and you have neither paid the required Premium nor surrendered
  the policy for its Cash Surrender Value, you may reinstate the policy
  by:
�




���


submitting
  a written request at any time within three years after the end
  of the
  Grace Period and prior to the Maturity
  Date;




�




���


providing
  evidence of insurability satisfactory to
  us;




�




���


paying
  sufficient Premium to cover all policy charges that were due and
  unpaid
  during the Grace Period;




�




���


paying
  sufficient Premium to keep the policy In Force for three months
  from the
  date of reinstatement; and




�




���


paying
  or reinstating any indebtedness against the policy that existed
  at the end
  of the Grace Period.




�
The
  effective date of a reinstated policy will be the monthly anniversary date
  on or
  next following the date we approve the application for
  reinstatement.��If the policy is reinstated, the Cash Value on the
  date of reinstatement, will be set to the Cash Value at the end of the Grace
  Period.
�
We
  will
  then add any Premiums or loan repayments that you made to reinstate the
  policy.
�
The
  allocations to Sub-Account portfolios in effect at the start of the Grace
  Period
  will be reinstated, unless you instruct otherwise.
�

Taxes

�
The
  tax
  treatment of life insurance policies under the Code is complex and the tax
  treatment of your policy will depend on your particular
  circumstances.���Seek competent tax advice regarding the tax
  treatment of the policy given your situation.��The following
  discussion provides an overview of the Code�s provisions relating to certain
  common life insurance policy transactions.��It is not and cannot be
  comprehensive, and it cannot replace personalized advice provided by a competent
  tax professional.
�
Types
  of Taxes of Which To Be Aware
�
Federal
  Income Tax.��Generally, the United States assesses a tax on
  income, which is broadly defined to include all items of income from whatever
  source, unless specifically excluded.��Certain expenditures can reduce
  income for tax purposes and correspondingly the amount of tax
  payable.��These expenditures are called deductions.��While
  there are many more income tax concepts under the Code, the concepts of "income"
  and "deduction" are the most fundamental to the federal income tax treatment
  that pertains to this policy.
�
Federal
  Transfer Tax.��In addition to the income tax, the United States
  also assesses a tax on some or all of the value of certain transfers of wealth
  made by gift while a person is living (the federal gift tax), and by bequest
  or
  otherwise at the time of a person�s death (the federal estate tax).
�
The
  federal gift tax is imposed on the value of the property (including cash)
  transferred by gift.��Each donor is allowed to exclude an amount (in
  2007, up to $12,000 per recipient) from the value of present interest
  gifts.��In addition, each donor is allowed a credit against the tax on
  the first million dollars in lifetime gifts (calculated after taking into
  account the $12,000 exclusion amount).��An unlimited marital deduction
  may be available for certain lifetime gifts made by the donor to the donor's
  spouse.��Unlike the estate tax, the gift tax is not scheduled to be
  repealed.
�
In
  general, in 2007, an estate of less than $2,000,000 (inclusive of certain
  pre-death gifts) will not incur a federal estate tax liability.��The
  $2 million amount increases to $3.5 million in 2009.��The federal
  estate tax (but not the federal gift tax) is scheduled to be repealed effective
  after 2009; however, unless Congress acts to make that repeal permanent,
  the
  estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated with respect to decedents who die
  after
  December 31, 2010.��If the estate tax is reinstated and Congress has
  not acted further, the size of estates that will not incur an estate tax
  will
  revert to $1 million.


�


28





�


�
An
  unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate tax purposes
  for
  certain amounts that pass to the surviving spouse.
�
If
  the
  transfer is made to someone two or more generations younger than the transferor,
  the transfer may be subject to the federal generation-skipping transfer tax
  ("GSTT").��The GSTT provisions generally apply to the same transfers
  that are subject to estate or gift taxes.��The tax is imposed at a
  flat rate equal to the maximum estate tax rate (for 2007, 45%), and there
  is a
  provision for an aggregate $1 million exemption.��The GSTT is
  scheduled to be repealed effective after 2009; however, unless Congress acts
  to
  make that repeal permanent, the GSTT is scheduled to be reinstated on January
1,
2011 at a rate of 55%.
�
State
  and Local Taxes.��State and local estate, inheritance, income and
  other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of Policy Proceeds depend
  on the
  circumstances of each policy owner or beneficiary.��While these taxes
  may or may not be substantial in your case, state by state differences of
  these
  taxes preclude a useful description of them in this prospectus.
�
Buying
  the Policy
�
Federal
  Income Tax.��Generally, the Code treats life insurance Premiums
  as a personal expense.��This means that under the general rule you
  cannot deduct from your taxable income the Premiums paid to purchase the
  policy.
�
Federal
  Transfer Tax.��Generally, the Code treats the payment of Premiums
  on a life insurance policy as a gift when the Premium payment benefits someone
  else (such as when premium payments are paid by someone other than the policy
  owner).��Gifts are not generally included in the recipient�s taxable
  income.��If you (whether or not you are the Insured) transfer
  ownership of the policy to another person, the transfer may be subject to
  a
  federal gift tax.
�
Investment
  Gain in the Policy
�
The
  income tax treatment of changes in the policy�s Cash Value depends on whether
  the policy is "life insurance" under the Code.��If the policy meets
  the definition of life insurance, then the increase in the policy�s Cash Value
  is not included in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes unless
  it
  is distributed to you before the death of the Insured.
�
To
  qualify as life insurance, the policy must meet certain tests set out in
  Section
  7702 of the Code.��We will monitor the Policy�s compliance with Code
  Section 7702, and take whatever steps are necessary to stay in
  compliance.
�
Diversification.��In
  addition to meeting the tests required under Section 7702, Section 817(h)
  of the
  Code requires that the investments of the separate account be adequately
  diversified.��Regulations under Code Section 817(h) provide that a
  variable life policy that fails to satisfy the diversification standards
  will
  not be treated as life insurance unless such failure was inadvertent, is
  corrected, and the policy owner or the issuer pays an amount to the
  IRS.��If the failure to diversify is not corrected, the income and
  gain in the contract would be treated as taxable ordinary income for federal
  income tax purposes.
�
We
  will
  also monitor compliance with Code Section 817(h) and the regulations applicable
  to Section 817(h) and, to the extent necessary, will change the objectives
  or
  assets of the Sub-Account investments to remain in compliance.��Thus,
  the policy should receive federal income tax treatment as life
  insurance.
�
Representatives
  of the IRS have informally suggested, from time to time, that the number
  of
  underlying mutual funds available or the number of transfer opportunities
  available under a variable product may be relevant in determining whether
  the
  product qualifies for the desired tax treatment.��In 2003, the IRS
  issued formal guidance, in Revenue Ruling 2003-91, that indicates that if
  the
  number of underlying mutual funds available in a variable insurance product
  does
  not exceed 20, the number of funds alone would not cause the policy to not
  qualify for the desired tax treatment.��The IRS has also indicated
  that exceeding 20 investment options may be considered a factor, along with
  other factors including the number of transfer opportunities available under
  the
  policy, when determining whether the policy qualifies for the desired tax
  treatment.��The revenue ruling did not indicate the number of fund
  options, if any, that would cause the policy to not provide the desired tax
  treatment.��Should the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury issue additional
  rules or regulations limiting the number of underlying mutual funds, transfers
  between underlying mutual funds, exchanges of underlying mutual funds or
  changes
  in the investment objectives of underlying mutual funds such that the policy
  would no longer qualify as life insurance under Section 7702 of the Code,
  we
  will take whatever steps are available to remain in compliance.
�
Periodic
  Withdrawals, Non-Periodic
  Withdrawals and Loans
�
The
  tax
  treatment described in this section applies to withdrawals and loans you
  choose
  to take from the policy.��It also applies to Premiums we accept but
  then return to meet the Code's definition of life insurance.
�
The
  income tax treatment of distributions of cash from the policy depends on
  whether
  the policy is also a "modified endowment contract" under the Code. Generally,
  the income tax consequences of owning a life insurance contract that is not
  a
  modified endowment contract are more advantageous than the tax consequences
  of
  owning a life insurance contract that is a modified endowment
  contract.
�
The
  policies offered by this prospectus may or may not be issued as modified
  endowment contracts.��If a contract is issued as


�


29





�


a
  modified endowment contract, it will always be a modified endowment contract;
  a
  contract that is not issued as a modified endowment contract can become a
  modified endowment contract due to subsequent transactions with respect to
  the
  contract, such as payment of additional Premiums.��If the contract is
  not issued as a modified endowment contract, we will monitor it and advise
  you
  if��the payment of a Premium, or other transaction, may cause the
  contract to become a modified endowment contract.
�
When
  the Policy is Life Insurance that is a Modified Endowment
  Contract.��Section 7702A of the Code defines modified endowment
  contracts as those life insurance policies issued or materially changed on
  or
  after June 21, 1988 on which the total Premiums paid during the first seven
  years exceed the amount that would have been paid if the policy provided
  for
  paid up benefits after seven level annual Premiums.��Under certain
  conditions, a policy may become a modified endowment contract, or may become
  subject to a new 7 year testing period as a result of a "material change"
  or a
  "reduction in benefits" as defined by Section 7702A(c) of the Code.
�
All
  modified endowment contracts issued to the same owner by the same company
  during
  a single calendar year are required to be aggregated and treated as a single
  contract for purposes of determining the amount that is includible in income
  when a distribution occurs.
�
The
  Code
  provides special rules for the taxation of surrenders, partial surrenders,
  loans, collateral assignments and other pre-death distributions from modified
  endowment contracts.��Under these special rules, such transactions are
  taxable to the extent that at the time of the transaction the Cash Value
  of the
  policy exceeds the investment in the contract (generally, the Premiums paid
  for
  the policy).��In addition, a 10% tax penalty generally applies to the
  taxable portion of such distributions unless the policy owner is over age
  59� or
  disabled, or the distribution is part of a series of substantially equal
  periodic payments as defined in the Code.
�
When
  the Policy is Life Insurance that is NOT a Modified Endowment
  Contract.��If the policy is not issued as a modified endowment
  contract, we will monitor Premiums paid and will notify the policy owner
  when
  the policy is in jeopardy of becoming a modified endowment
  contract.��If a policy is not a modified endowment contract, a cash
  distribution during the first 15 years after a policy is issued that causes
  a
  reduction in Death Benefits may still become fully or partially taxable to
  the
  policy owner pursuant to Section 7702(f)(7) of the Code.��You should
  carefully consider this potential tax ramification and seek further information
  before requesting any changes in the terms of the policy.
�
Distributions
  from life insurance contracts that are not modified endowment contracts
  generally are treated as being from the investment in the contract (generally,
  the Premiums paid for the contract), and then from the income in the
  contract.��Because Premium payments are generally nondeductible,
  distributions not in excess of investment in the contract are generally not
  includible in income; instead, they reduce the owner�s investment in the
  contract.
�
However,
  if a policy is not a modified endowment contract, a cash distribution during
  the
  first 15 years after a policy is issued that causes a reduction in Death
  Benefits may still become fully or partially taxable to the policy owner
  pursuant to Section 7702(f)(7) of the Code.��You should carefully
  consider this potential tax ramification and seek further information before
  requesting any changes in the terms of the policy.
�
In
  addition, a loan from a life insurance contract that is not a modified endowment
  contract is not taxable when made, although it can be treated as a distribution
  if it is forgiven during the owner�s lifetime.��Distributions from
  contracts that are not modified endowment contracts are not subject to the
  10%
  early distribution penalty tax.
�
Surrendering
  the Policy
�
A
  full
  surrender, cancellation of the policy by Lapse, or the maturity of the policy
  on
  its Maturity Date may have adverse tax consequences.��If the amount
  you receive plus total policy Indebtedness exceeds the investment in the
  contract (generally, the Premiums paid into the policy), then the excess
  generally will be treated as taxable ordinary income, regardless of whether
  or
  not the policy is a modified endowment contract.��In certain
  circumstances, for example when the policy Indebtedness is very large, the
  amount of tax could exceed the amount distributed to you at
  surrender.
�
Withholding
�
Distributions
  of income from a life insurance policy, including a life insurance policy
  that
  is a modified endowment contract, are subject to federal income tax
  withholding.��Generally, the recipient may elect not to have the
  withholding taken from the distribution.��We will withhold income tax
  unless you advise us, in writing, of your request not to withhold.��If
  you request that taxes not be withheld, or if the taxes withheld are
  insufficient, you may be liable for payment of an estimated tax.
�
A
  distribution of income from a life insurance policy may be subject to mandatory
  back-up withholding.��Mandatory back-up withholding means that we are
  required to withhold taxes on a distribution, at the rate established by
  Section
  3406 of the Code, and the recipient cannot elect to receive the entire
  distribution at once.��Mandatory back-up withholding may arise if we
  have not been provided a taxpayer identification number, or if the IRS notifies
  us that back-up withholding is required.
�
In
  certain employer-sponsored life insurance arrangements, participants may
  be
  required to report for income tax purposes,


�


30





�


one
  or
  more of the following:
�




���


the
  value each year of the life insurance protection
  provided;








���


an
  amount equal to any employer-paid Premiums;
  or








���


some
  or all of the amount by which the current value exceeds the employer�s
  interest in the policy; or








���


interest
  that is deemed to have been forgiven on a loan that we deemed to
  have been
  made by the employer.




�
Participants
  in an employer-sponsored plan relating to this policy should consult with
  the
  sponsor or the administrator of the plan, and/or with their personal tax
  or
  legal advisor, to determine the tax consequences, if any, of their
  employer-sponsored life insurance arrangements.
�
Exchanging
  the Policy for Another Life
  Insurance Policy
�
Generally,
  you will pay taxes on amounts that you receive in excess of your Premium
  payments when you completely surrender the policy.��If, however, you
  exchange the policy for another life insurance policy, modified endowment
  contract, or annuity contract, you will not be taxed on the excess amount
  if the
  exchange meets the requirements of Code Section 1035.��To meet Section
  1035 requirements, the Insured named in the policy must be the Insured for
  the
  new policy or contract and the new policy or contract cannot extend the Maturity
  Date or otherwise delay a distribution that would extend the time that tax
  would
  be payable.��Generally, the new policy or contract will be treated as
  having the same issue date and tax basis as the old policy or
  contract.
�
If
  the
  policy or contract is subject to a policy Indebtedness that is discharged
  as
  part of the exchange transaction, the discharge of the Indebtedness may be
  taxable.��Owners should consult with their personal tax or legal
  advisors in structuring any policy exchange transaction.
�
Taxation
  of Death Benefits
�
Federal
  Income Tax.��The Death Benefit is generally excludable from the
  beneficiary's gross income under Section 101 of the Code.��However, if
  the policy is transferred to a new policy owner for valuable consideration,
  a
  portion of the Death Benefit may be includable in the beneficiary�s gross income
  when it is paid.
�
The
  payout option selected by your beneficiary may affect how the payments received
  by the beneficiary are taxed.��Under the various payout options, the
  amount payable to the beneficiary may include earnings on the Death Benefit,
  which will be taxable as ordinary income.��For example, if the
  beneficiary elects to receive interest only, then the entire amount of the
  interest payment will be taxable to the beneficiary; if a periodic payment
  (whether for a fixed period or for life) is selected, then a portion of each
  payment will be taxable interest income, and a portion will be treated as
  the
  nontaxable payment of the Death Benefit.��Your beneficiaries should
  consult with their tax advisors to determine the tax consequences of electing
  a
  payout option, based on their individual circumstances.

Special
  federal income tax considerations for life insurance policies owned by
  employers.��In 2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection
  Act of 2006, which contains new Code Sections 101(j) and 6039I, which affect
  the
  tax treatment of life insurance contracts owned by the employer of the
  Insured.��These provisions are generally effective for life insurance
  contracts issued after August 17, 2006,��If a life insurance policy
  was issued on or before August 17, 2006, but materially modified after that
  date, it will be treated as having been issued after that date for purposes
  of
  Section 101(j).��Contracts issued after August 17, 2006 pursuant to a
  Section 1035 exchange generally are excluded from the operation of these
  new
  provisions, provided that the contract received in the exchange does not
  have a
  material increase in death benefit or other material change with respect
  to the
  old contract.

New
  Section 101(j) provides the general rule that, with respect to an employer-owned
  life insurance contract, the amount of death benefit payable directly or
  indirectly to the employer that may be excluded from income cannot exceed
  the
  sum of Premiums and other payments paid by the policyholder for the
  contract.��Consequently, under this general rule, the entire death
  benefit, less the cost to the policyholder, will be taxable.��Although
  Section 101(j) is not clear, if lifetime distributions from the contract
  are
  made as a nontaxable return of premium, it appears that the reduction would
  apply for Section 101(j) purposes and reduce the amount of Premiums for this
  purpose.

There
  are
  2 exceptions to this general rule of taxability, provided that statutory
  notice,
  consent, and information requirements are satisfied.��These
  requirements are as follows:��prior to the issuance by the company,
  (a) the employee is notified in writing that the employer intends to insure
  the
  employee's life, and the maximum face amount for which the employee could
  be
  Insured at the time that the contract is issued; (b) the employee provides
  written consent to being insured under the contract and that such coverage
  may
  continue after the Insured terminates employment; and (c) the employee is
  informed in writing that the employer will be a beneficiary of any proceeds
  payable upon the death of the employee.��If the employer fails to meet
  all of those requirements, then neither exception can apply.


�


31





�


The
  2
  exceptions are as follows.��First, if proper notice and consent are
  given and received, and if the Insured was an employee at any time during
  the
  12-month period before the Insured�s death, then new Section 101(j) would not
  apply.

Second,
  if proper notice and consent are given and received and, at the time that
  the
  contract is issued, the Insured is either a director, a �highly compensated
  employee� (within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code without regard to
  paragraph (a)(B)(ii) thereof), or a �highly compensated individual� (within the
  meaning of Section 105(h)(5), except �35%� is substituted for �25%� in paragraph
  (C) thereof), then the new Section 101(j) would not apply.

Code
  Section 6039I requires any policyholder of an employer-owned contract to
  file an
  annual return showing (a) the number of employees of the policyholder, (b)
  the
  number of such employees insured under employee-owned contracts at the end
  of
  the year, (c) the total amount of insurance in force with respect to those
  contracts at the end of the year, (d) the name, address, taxpayer identification
  number and type of business of the policyholder, and (e) that the policyholder
  has a valid consent for each Insured (or, if all consents are not obtained,
  the
  number of insured employees for whom such consent was not
  obtained).��Proper recordkeeping is also required by this
  section.

It
  is
  your responsibility to (a) provide the proper notice to each Insured, (b)
  obtain
  the proper consent from each Insured, (c) inform each Insured in writing
  that
  you will be the beneficiary of any proceeds payable upon the death of the
  Insured, and (d) file the annual return required by Section 6039I.��If
  you fail to provide the necessary notice and information, or fail to obtain
  the
  necessary consent, the death benefit will be taxable to you when
  received.��If you fail to file a properly completed return under
  Section 6039I, you could be required to pay a penalty.
�
Federal
  Transfer Taxes.��When the Insured dies, the Death Benefit will
  generally be included in the Insured's federal gross estate if: (1) the Proceeds
  were payable to or for the benefit of the Insured's estate; or (2) the Insured
  held any "incident of ownership" in the policy at death or at any time within
  3
  years of death.��An incident of ownership, in general, is any right
  that may be exercised by the policy owner, such as the right to borrow on
  the
  policy or the right to name a new beneficiary.
�
If
  the
  beneficiary is two or more generations younger than the Insured, the Death
  Benefit may be subject to the GSTT.��Pursuant to regulations issued by
  the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, we may be required to withhold a portion
  of
  the Proceeds and pay them directly to the IRS as the GSTT payment.
�
If
  the
  policy owner is not the Insured or a beneficiary, payment of the Death Benefit
  to the beneficiary will be treated as a gift to the beneficiary from the
  policy
  owner.
�
Terminal
  Illness
�
Certain
  distributions made under a policy on the life of a �terminally ill individual�
or a �chronically ill individual,� as those terms are defined in the Code, are
  treated as death proceeds.��See, �Taxation of Death Benefits,�
above.
�
Special
  Considerations for Corporations
�
Section
  264 of the Code imposes a number of limitations on the interest and other
  business deductions that may otherwise be available to businesses that own
  life
  insurance policies.��In addition, the Premium paid by a business for a
  life insurance policy is not deductible as a business expense or otherwise
  if
  the business is directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy.
�
For
  purposes of the alternative minimum tax ("AMT") that may be imposed on
  corporations, the death benefit from a life insurance policy, even though
  excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes, is included in "adjusted
  current earnings" for AMT purposes.��In addition, although increases
  to the Cash Surrender Value of a life insurance policy are generally excluded
  from gross income for normal income tax purposes, such increases are included
  in
  adjusted current earnings for income tax purposes.
�
Due
  to
  the complexity of these rules, and because they are affected by your facts
  and
  circumstances, you should consult with legal and tax counsel and other competent
  advisors regarding these matters.
�
Federal
  appellate and trial courts have examined the economic substance of transactions
  involving life insurance policies owned by corporations.��These cases
  involved relatively large loans against the policy�s Cash Value as well as tax
  deductions for the interest paid on the policy loans by the corporate policy
  owner to the insurance company.��Under the particular factual
  circumstances in these cases, the courts determined that the corporate policy
  owners should not have taken tax deductions for the interest
  paid.��Accordingly, the court determined that the corporations should
  have paid taxes on the amounts deducted.��Corporations should
  consider, in consultation with tax professionals familiar with these matters,
  the impact of these decisions on the corporation�s intended use of the
  policy.
�
See,
  also, �Business Uses of the Policy,� below.
�
Taxes
  and the Value of Your Policy
�
For
  federal income tax purposes, a separate account is not a separate entity
  from
  the company.��Thus, the tax status of the


�


32





�


separate
  account is not distinct from our status as a life insurance
  company.��Investment income and realized capital gains on the assets
  of the separate account are reinvested and taken into account in determining
  the
  value of Accumulation Units.��As a result, such investment
  income and realized capital gains are automatically applied to increase reserves
  under the policies.
�
At
  present, we do not expect to incur any federal income tax liability that
  would
  be chargeable to the Accumulation Units.��Based upon these
  expectations, no charge is being made against your Accumulation Units for
  federal income taxes.��If, however, we determine that taxes may be
  incurred, we reserve the right to assess a charge for these taxes.
�
We
  may
  also incur state and local taxes (in addition to those described in the
  discussion of the Premium Taxes) in several states.��At present, these
  taxes are not significant.��If they increase, however, charges for
  such taxes may be made that would decrease the value of your Accumulation
  Units.
�
Business
  Uses of the Policy
�
The
  life
  insurance policy may be used in various arrangements, including nonqualified
  deferred compensation or salary continuance plans, split dollar insurance
  plans,
  executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans, and others.��The
  tax consequences of these plans may vary depending on the particular facts
  and
  circumstances of each individual arrangement.��The IRS has also
  recently issued new guidance on split dollar insurance plans.��In
  addition, Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, which sets forth new rules
  for
  taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation, was added to the Code for
  deferrals after December 31, 2004.��Therefore, if you are
  contemplating using the Policy in any arrangement the value of which depends
  in
  part on its tax consequences, you should be sure to consult a tax advisor
  as to
  tax attributes of the arrangement.
�
Non-Resident
  Aliens and Other Persons Who are not Citizens of the United
  States
�
Special
  income tax laws and rules apply to non-resident aliens of the United States
  including certain withholding requirements with respect to pre-death
  distributions from the policy.��In addition, foreign law may impose
  additional taxes on the policy, the Death Benefit, or other distributions
  and/or
  ownership of the policy.
�
In
  addition, special gift, estate and GSTT laws and rules may apply to non-resident
  aliens, and to transfers to persons who are not citizens of the United States,
  including limitations on the marital deduction if the surviving or donee
  spouse
  is not a citizen of the United States.
�
If
  you
  are a non-resident alien, or a resident alien, or if any of your beneficiaries
  (including your spouse) are not citizens of the United States, you should
  confer
  with a competent tax professional with respect to the tax treatment of this
  policy.
�
If
  you,
  the Insured, the beneficiary, or other person receiving any benefit or interest
  in or from the policy, are not both a resident and citizen of the United
  States,
  there may be a tax imposed by a foreign country that is in addition to any
  tax
  imposed by the United States.��The foreign law (including regulations,
  rulings, treatiers with the United States, and case law) may change and impose
  additional or increased taxes on the policy, payment of the Death Benefit,
  or
  other distributions and/or ownership of the policy.
�
Tax
  Changes
�
The
  foregoing discussion, which is based on our understanding of federal tax
  laws as
  currently interpreted by the IRS, is general and is not intended as tax
  advice.
�
The
  Code
  has been subjected to numerous amendments and changes, and it is reasonable
  to
  believe that it will continue to be revised.��The United States
  Congress has, in the past, considered numerous legislative proposals that,
  if
  enacted, could change the tax treatment of life insurance
  policies.��It is reasonable to believe that such proposals, and future
  proposals, may be enacted into law.��The U.S. Treasury Department may
  amend existing regulations, issue new regulations, or adopt new interpretations
  of existing law that may be differ from its current positions on these
  matters.��In addition, current state law (which is not discussed
  herein) and future amendments to state law may affect the tax consequences
  of
  the policy.
�
In
  2001,
  the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) was
  enacted into law.��EGTRRA contained numerous changes to the federal
  income, gift, estate and generation skipping transfer taxes, many of which
  are
  not scheduled to become effective until a future date.��Among other
  matters, EGTRRA provides for the repeal of the federal estate and
  generation-skipping transfer taxes after 2009; however, unless Congress and
  the
  President enact additional legislation, EGTRRA also provides that all of
  those
  changes will "sunset" after 2010, and the estate and generation skipping
  transfer taxes will be reinstated as if EGTRRA had never been
  enacted.
�
The
  foregoing is a general explanation as to certain tax matters pertaining to
  insurance policies.��It is not intended to be legal or tax
  advice.��You should consult your independent legal, tax and/or
  financial advisor.
�
Any
  or
  all of the foregoing may change from time to time without any notice, and
  the
  tax consequences arising out of a policy may be changed
  retroactively.��There is no way of predicting if, when, or to what
  extent any such change may take place.��We make no representation as
  to the likelihood of the continuation of these current laws, interpretations,
  and policies.

Organization,
  Registration And Operation
�
Nationwide
  VL Separate Account-C is a separate account established under Ohio
  law.��We own the assets in this account, and we are obligated to pay
  all benefits under the policies.��We may use the account to support
  other variable life insurance policies we issue.��It is registered
  with the SEC as a Unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act
  of 1940
  ("1940 Act") and qualifies as a "separate account" within the meaning of
  the
  federal securities laws.��This registration, however, does not involve
  the SEC�s supervision of this account�s management or investment practice or
  policies.
�
It
  is
  divided into Sub-Accounts that may invest in shares of the available Sub-Account
  portfolios.��We buy and sell the Sub-Account portfolio shares at Net
  Asset Value.��Any dividends and distributions from a Sub-Account
  portfolio are reinvested at Net Asset Value in shares of that Sub-Account
  portfolio.
�
Income,
  gains, and losses, whether or not realized, from the assets in the account
  will
  be credited to, or charged against, the account without regard to our other
  income, gains, or losses.��Income, gains, and losses credited to, or
  charged against, a Sub-Account reflect the Sub-Account�s own Investment
  Experience and not the Investment Experience of our other assets.��Its
  assets are held separately from our other assets and are not part of our
  general
  account.��We may not use the separate account�s assets to pay any of
  our liabilities other than those arising from the policies.��If the
  separate account�s assets exceed the required reserves and its other
  liabilities, we may transfer the excess to our general account.��The
  separate account may include other Sub-Accounts that are not available under
  the
  policies, and are not discussed in this prospectus.
�
If
  investment in the mutual funds or a particular portfolio is no longer possible,
  in our judgment becomes inappropriate for the purposes of the policy, or
  for any
  other reason at our sole discretion, we may substitute another mutual fund
  or
  portfolio without your consent.��The substituted mutual fund or
  portfolio may have different fees and expenses.��Substitution may be
  made with respect to existing investments or the investments of future Premium,
  or both.��We will comply with federal securities laws to effect a
  substitution.��Furthermore, we may close Sub-Accounts to allocations
  of Premiums or policy value, or both, at any time at our sole
  discretion.��The mutual funds, which sell their shares to the
  Sub-Accounts pursuant to participation agreements, also may terminate these
  agreements and discontinue offering their shares to the
  Sub-Accounts.
�
In
  addition, we reserve the right to make other structural and operational changes
  affecting this separate account.
�
We
  do not guarantee any money you place in this separate account.��The
  value of each Sub-Account will increase or decrease, depending on the investment
  performance of the corresponding portfolio.��You could lose some or
  all of your money.
�
Addition,
  Deletion, Or Substitution Of Mutual Funds
�
Where
  permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to:
�




���


remove,
  combine, or add Sub-Accounts and make new Sub-Accounts available
  to
  you;




�




���


substitute
  shares of another mutual fund, which may have different fees and
  expenses,
  for shares of an existing mutual
  fund;




�




���


substitute
  or close Sub-Accounts to
  allocations;




�




���


transfer
  assets supporting the policies from one Sub-Account to another
  or from the
  separate account to another separate
  account;




�




���


combine
  the separate account with other separate accounts, and/or create
  new
  separate accounts;




�




���


deregister
  the separate account under the 1940 Act, or operate the separate
  account
  as a management investment company under the 1940 Act, or as any
  other
  form permitted by the law; and




�




���


modify
  the policy provisions to reflect changes in the Sub-Accounts and
  the
  separate account to comply with applicable
  law.




�
Voting
  Rights
�
Unless
  there is a change in existing law, on all matters submitted to shareholders
  we
  will vote our portfolio shares attributable to your allocations in a Sub-Account
  only as you instruct.


�


34





�


Before
  a
  vote of a portfolio�s shareholders occurs, you will have the right to instruct
  us based on the number of portfolio shares that corresponds to the amount
  of
  policy account value you have in the portfolio (as of a date set by the
  portfolio).��We will vote shares for which no instructions are
  received in the same proportion as those that are received.��What this
  means to you is that when only a small number of policy owners vote, each
  vote
  has a greater impact on, and may control the outcome of the vote.
�
The
  number of shares that a policy owner may vote is determined by dividing the
  Cash
  Value of the amount they have allocated to an underlying mutual fund by the
  Net
  Asset Value of that underlying mutual fund. We will designate a date for
  this
  determination not more than 90 days before the shareholder meeting.

Legal
  Proceedings

�
Nationwide
  Life and Annuity Insurance Company
�
Nationwide
  and its parent company, Nationwide Life Insurance Company (�NLIC�) are parties
  to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its
  business. It is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the
  pending investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges
  of
  potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain
  of those referred to below, are in very preliminary stages, and Nationwide
  does
  not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs� claims
  for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as
  class
  actions, the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified
  or (in
  the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many
  of
  the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other
  relief, including punitive damages and equitable remedies, which are difficult
  to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available.
  Nationwide does not believe, based on information currently known by management,
  that the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are
  likely to have a material adverse effect on Nationwide�s consolidated financial
  position. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in
  certain of these matters and inherent unpredictability of litigation, it
  is
  possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could have a material
  adverse effect on Nationwide�s consolidated financial results in a particular
  quarterly or annual period.
�
In
  recent
  years, life insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits,
  including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity pricing
  and sales practices. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial
  jury awards or settlements against life insurers other than
  Nationwide.
�
The
  financial services industry, including mutual fund, variable annuity, life
  insurance and distribution companies, has also been the subject of increasing
  scrutiny by regulators, legislators and the media over the past few years.
  Numerous regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the National Association
  of
  Securities Dealers and the New York State Attorney General, have commenced
  industry-wide investigations regarding late trading and market timing in
  connection with mutual funds and variable insurance contracts, and have
  commenced enforcement actions against some mutual fund and life insurance
  companies on those issues. Nationwide has been contacted by or received
  subpoenas from the SEC and the New York State Attorney General, who are
  investigating market timing in certain mutual funds offered in insurance
  products sponsored by Nationwide. Nationwide has cooperated with these
  investigations. Information requests from the New York State Attorney General
  and the SEC with respect to investigations into late trading and market timing
  were last responded to by Nationwide and its affiliates in December 2003
  and
  June 2005, respectively, and no further information requests have been received
  with respect to these matters.

In
  addition, state and federal regulators have commenced investigations or other
  proceedings relating to compensation and bidding arrangements and possible
  anti-competitive activities between insurance producers and brokers and issuers
  of insurance products, and unsuitable sales and replacements by producers
  on
  behalf of the issuer. Also under investigation are compensation and revenue
  sharing arrangements between the issuers of variable insurance contracts
  and
  mutual funds or their affiliates, the use of side agreements and finite
  reinsurance agreements, funding agreements issued to back NLIC�s MTN programs,
  recordkeeping and retention compliance by broker/dealers, and supervision
  of
  former registered representatives. Related investigations and proceedings
  may be
  commenced in the future. Nationwide and/or its affiliates have been contacted
  by
  or received subpoenas from state and federal regulatory agencies, state
  securities law regulators and state attorneys general for information relating
  to certain of these investigations, including those relating to compensation,
  revenue sharing and bidding arrangements, anti-competitive activities,
  unsuitable sales or replacement practices, the use of side agreements and
  finite
  reinsurance agreements, and funding agreements backing NLIC�s MTN program.
  Nationwide is cooperating with regulators in connection with these inquiries
  and
  will cooperate with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) in responding
  to
  these inquiries to the extent that any inquiries encompass NMIC�s
  operations.
�
These
  proceedings are expected to continue in the future and could result in legal
  precedents and new industry-wide legislation, rules and regulations that
  could
  significantly affect the financial services industry, including life insurance
  and annuity companies. These proceedings also could affect the outcome of
  one or
  more of Nationwide�s litigation matters. There can be no assurance that any such
  litigation or regulatory actions will not have a material adverse effect
  on
  Nationwide in the future.

On
  January�21, 2004, Nationwide was named in a lawsuit filed in the United
  States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi entitled
United Investors Life Insurance Company v. Nationwide Life Insurance
  Company
  and/or Nationwide Life


�

�


Insurance
  Company of America and/or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company and/or
  Nationwide Life and Annuity Company of America and/or Nationwide Financial
  Services, Inc. and/or Nationwide Financial Corporation, and John Does A-Z.
  In its complaint, the plaintiff alleges that Nationwide and/or its affiliated
  life insurance companies caused the replacement of variable insurance policies
  and other financial products issued by United Investors with policies issued
  by
  the Companies. The plaintiff raises claims for (1)�violations of the
  Federal Lanham Act, and common law unfair competition and defamation;
  (2)�tortious interference with the plaintiff�s contractual relationship
  with Waddell�& Reed, Inc. and/or its affiliates, Waddell�&
Reed Financial, Inc., Waddell�& Reed Financial Services, Inc. and
  W&R Insurance Agency, Inc., or with the plaintiff�s contractual
  relationships with its variable policyholders; (3)�civil conspiracy; and
  (4)�breach of fiduciary duty. The complaint seeks compensatory damages,
  punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, a full accounting, a
  constructive trust and costs and disbursements, including attorneys� fees. On
  December�30, 2005, Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment. On
  June�15, 2006, the District Court granted Nationwide�s motion for summary
  judgment on all grounds and dismissed the plaintiff�s entire case with
  prejudice. The plaintiff appealed the District Court�s decision to the Fifth
  Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal has been fully briefed, and Nationwide
  is
  awaiting a decision. Nationwide and NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
The
  following cases relate specifically to NLIC (Nationwide�s
  parent):
�
On
  November�15, 2006, NLIC was named in a lawsuit filed in the United States
  District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entitled Kevin Beary,
  Sheriff of Orange County, Florida, In His Official Capacity, Individually
  and On
  Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Nationwide Life Insurance Co.,
  Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. and Nationwide Financial Services,
  Inc. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all sponsors of 457(b)
  deferred compensation plans in the United States that had variable annuity
  contracts with the defendants at any time during the class period, or in
  the
  alternative, all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in Florida
  that
  had variable annuity contracts with the defendants during the class period.
  The
  Class Period is from January�1, 1996 until the Class Notice is provided.
  The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties
  by
  arranging for and retaining service payments from certain mutual funds. The
  complaint seeks an accounting, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction
  and disgorgement or restitution of the service fee payments allegedly received
  by the defendants, including interest. On January�25, 2007, NLIC filed a
  motion to dismiss.��NLIC intends to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
On
  February�11, 2005, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Common
  Pleas Court, Franklin County, Ohio entitled Michael Carr v. Nationwide Life
  Insurance Company. The complaint seeks recovery for breach of contract,
  fraud by omission, violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act and
  unjust enrichment. The complaint also seeks unspecified compensatory damages,
  disgorgement of all amounts in excess of the guaranteed maximum premium and
  attorneys� fees. On February�2, 2006, the Court granted the plaintiff�s
  motion for class certification on the breach of contract and unjust enrichment
  claims. The Court certified a class consisting of all residents of the United
  States and the Virgin Islands who, during the Class Period, paid premiums
  on a
  modal basis to NLIC for term life insurance policies issued by Nationwide
  during
  the Class Period that provide for guaranteed maximum premiums, excluding
  certain
  specified products. Excluded from the class are NLIC; any parent, subsidiary
  or
  affiliate of NLIC; all employees, officers and directors of NLIC; and any
  justice, judge or magistrate judge of the State of Ohio who may hear the
  case.
  The Class Period is from February�10, 1990 through February�2, 2006,
  the date the class was certified. On January�26, 2007, the plaintiff filed
  a motion for summary judgment. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
On
  April�13, 2004, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Circuit
  Court, Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County, Illinois, entitled Woodbury
  v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company. Nationwide removed this case to the
  United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on
  June�1, 2004. On December�27, 2004, the case was transferred to the
  United States District Court for the District of Maryland and included in
  the
  multi-district proceeding entitled In Re Mutual Funds Investment
  Litigation. In response, on May�13, 2005, the plaintiff filed a First
  Amended Complaint purporting to represent, with certain exceptions, a class
  of
  all persons who held (through their ownership of a NLIC annuity or insurance
  product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested in mutual funds that included
  foreign securities in their portfolios and that experienced market timing
  or
  stale price trading activity. The First Amended Complaint purports to disclaim,
  with respect to market timing or stale price trading in NLIC�s annuities
  sub-accounts, any allegation based on NLIC�s untrue statement, failure to
  disclose any material fact, or usage of any manipulative or deceptive device
  or
  contrivance in connection with any class member�s purchases or sales of NLIC
  annuities or units in annuities sub-accounts. The plaintiff claims, in the
  alternative, that if NLIC is found with respect to market timing or stale
  price
  trading in its annuities sub-accounts, to have made any untrue statement,
  to
  have failed to disclose any material fact or to have used or employed any
  manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, then the plaintiff purports
  to
  represent a class, with certain exceptions, of all persons who, prior to
  NLIC�s
  untrue statement, omission of material fact, use or employment of any
  manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, held (through their ownership
  of an NLIC annuity or insurance product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested
  in mutual funds that included foreign securities in their portfolios and
  that
  experienced market timing activity. The First Amended Complaint alleges common
  law negligence and seeks to recover damages not to exceed $75,000 per plaintiff
  or class member, including all compensatory damages and costs. On June�1,
2006, the District Court granted NLIC�s motion to dismiss the plaintiff�s
  complaint. On November�29, 2006, the plaintiff filed


�


36





�


its
  appellate brief with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals contesting the District
  Court�s dismissal. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.
�
On
  August�15, 2001, NLIC was named in a lawsuit filed in the United States
  District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled Lou Haddock, as
  trustee of the Flyte Tool�& Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation
  Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. and Nationwide Life Insurance
  Company. Currently, the plaintiffs� fifth amended complaint, filed
  March�21, 2006, purports to represent a class of qualified retirement plans
  under ERISA that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege
  that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts
  and
  that NLIC breached ERISA fiduciary duties by allegedly accepting service
  payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some
  or
  all of the payments allegedly received by NLIC, other unspecified relief
  for
  restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys� fees. To date,
  the District Court has rejected the plaintiffs� request for certification of the
  alleged class. NLIC�s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs� fifth amended complaint
  is currently pending before the court. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit
  vigorously.

	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' and Section 17(b) Applicants' Representations
1. NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL which is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of Accounts II, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and P-1 and VLI Accounts 2, 4, 7, and P-1. NLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of B, G, and P-A and VLI Account P-A.
2. All of the Separate Accounts are registered unit investment trusts used to issue one or more Contracts together with their respective Insurance Company. The file numbers for each Separate Account's registration under the Act and each Contract's registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) are set forth in the Application.
3. NVIT is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type, and it securities are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File Nos. 811-03213 and 002-73024). Two of these series, the NVIT—American Century NVIT Multi-Cap Value Fund and NVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (each an “NVIT Fund”), are the replacement funds (“New Funds” or “New Portfolios”) in the proposed Substitutions.Start Printed Page 66807

4. Nationwide Fund Advisors (“NFA”) currently serves as investment adviser to each of the NVIT Funds. NFA employs a subadvisory structure as part of its advisory strategy with respect to the NVIT Funds. Through an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, NVIT is exempt from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”).[1] 

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:
No.Old fundOld classNVIT New fundNew class1American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.—American Century VP Value Fund (“Old Value Fund”)Class INVIT—American Century NVIT Multi Cap Value Fund (“New Multi Cap Value Fund”)Class I2Old Value FundClass IINew Multi Cap Value FundClass II3Fidelity Variable Insurance Products (“VIP”) Fund—VIP Contrafund Portfolio (“Old Contrafund Portfolio”)Initial ClassNVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (“New Large Cap Growth Fund”)Class I4Old Contrafund PortfolioService ClassNew Large Cap Growth FundClass I5Old Contrafund PortfolioService Class 2New Large Cap Growth FundClass II6Fidelity VIP Fund—VIP Growth Opportunities Portfolio (“Old Growth Opps.

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Start Printed Page 66808Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and Start Printed Page 66809New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the Start Printed Page 66810necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio Start Printed Page 66811securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

With a variable universal life policy, you can take advantage of potential economic growth because your policy value is invested in the stock market. Your policy also has the flexibility to adjust to your changing needs. Underlying sub-accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
However, it also puts greater responsibility on you - you assume the investment and mortality risks, and you select and monitor your own underlying investment options, instead of the insurance company doing it for you.
Your insurance needs may change if your personal situation changes, for example if you get married, have a child or get a promotion. Make sure that these strategies and products are suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make sure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn’t lapse if the market goes down. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole surrender your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may face tax consequences.
There are fees and charges for variable life insurance, including a cost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person such as gender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and expenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.
Before purchasing a variable life insurance policy, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the policy and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They don't apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options. Underlying sub accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. Both the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company. P.O. Box.182021 Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before investing, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses contain this and other important information. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.

Please read this important information
Keep in mind that investing involves market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Also, know that underlying investment options are only available in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. They are not offered directly to the public.
Protections and guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing life insurance company.
Keep in mind that taking money from your policy immediately reduces both the cash value and the death benefit payable, and can cause the need for more premiums to be paid into the policy in the future. You should always take care to ensure that your life insurance needs continue to be met over time subsequent to taking cash from your policy.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. You can obtain the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company, P.O. Box 182021, Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus carefully and consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Investing involves risk.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options.
Investment products are not FDIC-insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee.
