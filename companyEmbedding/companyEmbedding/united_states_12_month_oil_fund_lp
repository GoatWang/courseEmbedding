(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto of the United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP ("US12OF") included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Forward-Looking Information  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause US12OF's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe US12OF's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend" or "project," the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and US12OF cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. US12OF's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  US12OF has based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and US12OF assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although US12OF undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that US12OF may make directly to them or through reports that US12OF in the future files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  Introduction  US12OF, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the "NYSE Arca"). The investment objective of US12OF is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units' per unit net asset value ("NAV") to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in the average of the prices of 12 futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the "NYMEX") that is the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 months for a total of 12 consecutive months' contracts, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 consecutive months (the "Benchmark Futures Contracts"), less US12OF's expenses. "Near month contract" means the next contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire. "Next month contract" means the first contract traded on the NYMEX due to expire after the near month contract. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 contracts, each contract month will be equally weighted. It is not the intent of US12OF to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light, sweet crude oil. It is not the intent of US12OF to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. The general partner of US12OF, United States Commodity Funds LLC ("USCF"), believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Oil Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Oil-Related Investments (as defined below).  US12OF invests in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, "Oil Futures Contracts") and other oil interests such as cash-settled options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of crude oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, "Other Oil-Related Investments"). For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments collectively are referred to as "Oil Interests" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  US12OF seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per unit NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, also measured in percentage terms. USCF believes the daily changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. It is not the intent of US12OF to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light, sweet crude oil. It is not the intent of US12OF to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments.  Regulatory Disclosure  Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics. Most significantly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the futures exchanges have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by US12OF is not) may hold, own or control. The net position is the difference between an individual's or firm's open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity. In addition, most U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts. Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S.-based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.  The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other Oil Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor's positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one month in the Benchmark Futures Contracts is 10,000 contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 20,000 net futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil. In addition, ICE Futures maintains accountability levels, position limits and monitoring authority for its futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil. If US12OF and the Related Public Funds (as defined below) exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contract for light, sweet crude oil, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure and may ask for further information on their activities including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of US12OF and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, US12OF could be ordered to reduce its position back to the accountability level. As of September 30, 2013, US12OF held 794 futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil traded on the NYMEX and did not hold any Oil Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, US12OF did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX or ICE Futures.  Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that US12OF will run up against such position limits because US12OF's investment strategy is to close out its positions and "roll" from the near month contract to expire and the eleven following months to the next month contract to expire and the eleven following months during one day each month. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, US12OF did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.  The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law, as exemplified by the various discussions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the National Futures Association (the "NFA"), the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies. Pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements, some specific examples of how the new Dodd-Frank Act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact US12OF are discussed below.  Futures Contracts and Position Limits  The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.  In October 2011, the CFTC adopted rules that impose new position limits on Referenced Contracts (as defined below) involving 28 energy, metals and agricultural commodities (the "Position Limit Rules"). The Position Limit Rules were scheduled to become effective on October 12, 2012. However, on September 28, 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated these regulations on the basis of ambiguities in the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA") (as modified by the Dodd-Frank Act) upon which the regulations were based. In its September 28, 2012 decision, the court remanded the Position Limit Rules to the CFTC with instructions to use its expertise and experience to resolve the ambiguities in the statute. On November 15, 2012, the CFTC indicated that it will move forward with an appeal of the District Court's decision to vacate the Position Limit Rules. At this time, it is not possible to predict how the CFTC's appeal could affect US12OF, but it may be substantial and adverse. Furthermore, until such time as the appeal is resolved or, if applicable revisions to the Position Limit Rules are proposed and adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the enactment of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, "Referenced Contracts"). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, US12OF may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the vacated Position Limit Rules would have required the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps. The CFTC is presently considering new aggregation rules, under a rulemaking proposal that is distinct from the Position Limit Rules. At this time, it is unclear how any modified aggregation rules may affect US12OF, but it may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the aggregation rules in combination with any potential revised Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of US12OF to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF's ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of US12OF.  Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of US12OF to achieve its investment objective.  "Swap" Transactions  The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new regulatory requirements on certain "swap" transactions that US12OF is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of US12OF to meet its investment objective. On August 13, 2012, the CFTC and the SEC published joint final rules defining the terms "swap" and "security-based swap." The term "swap" is broadly defined to include various types of over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps and options. The effective date of these final rules was October 12, 2012.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of "swap" be executed on organized exchanges or "swap execution facilities" and cleared through regulated clearing organizations (which are referred to in the Dodd-Frank Act as "derivative clearing organizations" ("DCOs")), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract. On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCOs. This is the CFTC's first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013. Beginning on March 11, 2013, "swap dealers," "major swap participants" and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps; and beginning on June 10, 2013, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps. As a result, if US12OF enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after June 10, 2013, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared. Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require US12OF to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that certain swaps determined to be available to trade on a swap execution facility ("SEF") must be executed over such a facility. On June 5, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule regarding the obligations of SEFs, including the obligation for facilities offering multiple person execution services to register as a SEF by October 2, 2013. On September 27 and 30, 2013, the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight granted no-action relief to SEFs from compliance with certain regulatory and reporting requirements. The no-action relief granted on September 27, 2013 included relief, in effect until November 1, 2013, from a requirement that a SEF enforce its own rulebooks and compel its participants to consent to the jurisdiction of the SEF. Based upon applications filed by several SEFs with the CFTC in the second half of October 2013, it is expected that the CFTC will determine that certain interest rate swaps will be determined to be available to trade on those SEFs in the first quarter of 2014.  On April 11, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement. The rule permits affiliated counterparties to elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement if, among other things, the counterparties are majority-owned affiliates whose financial statements are included in the same consolidated financial statements and whose swaps are documented and subject to a centralized risk management program. However, the exemption does not apply to swaps entered into by affiliated counterparties with unaffiliated counterparties.  On November 14, 2012, the CFTC proposed new regulations that would require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants ("FCMs"). The proposed rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard their continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner. The final regulations have not yet been adopted.  Additionally, the CFTC published rules on February 17, 2012 and April 3, 2012 that require "swap dealers" and "major swap participants" to: 1) adhere to business conduct standards, 2) implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the CEA and 3) maintain records of such compliance. These new requirements may impact the documentation requirements for both cleared and non-cleared swaps and cause swap dealers and major swap participants to face increased compliance costs that, in turn, may be passed along to counterparties (such as US12OF) in the form of higher fees and expenses that related to trading swaps.  On April 5, 2013, the CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk issued a letter granting no-action relief from certain swap data reporting requirements for swaps entered into between affiliated counterparties. In general, the letter grants relief from, among others: real-time, historical and regular swap reporting (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC's regulations, respectively).  On April 9, 2013, the CFTC's Division of Market Oversight issued a letter granting time-limited no-action relief to non-swap dealer, non-major swap participant counterparties from the real-time, regular and historical swap reporting requirements (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC's regulations, respectively). The regular reporting requirements (Part 45 of the CFTC regulations) for interest rate and credit swaps of a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as US12OF) began on April 10, 2013. The letter delays implementation of the reporting requirements based upon the asset class underlying the swap and the classification of the reporting counterparty. For a financial entity (including a commodity pool such as US12OF), regular reporting requirements for equity, foreign exchange and other commodity swaps (including swaps on oil) began on May 29, 2013 and reporting of all historical swaps for all asset classes begins on September 30, 2013.  In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation ("EMIR"). These regulations have not yet been fully implemented.  General Regulation Applicable to US12OF  On August 12, 2013, the CFTC issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators ("CPOs") of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") that are required to register due to recent changes to CFTC Regulation  With regard to any other rules that the CFTC may adopt in the future, the effect of any such regulatory changes on US12OF is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.  USCF, which is registered as a CPO and as a swaps firm with the CFTC, is authorized by the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of US12OF (the "LP Agreement") to manage US12OF. USCF is authorized by US12OF in its sole judgment to employ and establish the terms of employment for, and termination of, commodity trading advisors or FCMs.  Price Movements  Crude oil futures prices were volatile during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and exhibited moderate daily swings along with a slight upward trend during the period. The average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts started the period at $93.19 per barrel. Average prices hit a peak on August 28, 2013 at $102.96 per barrel. The low of the period was on April 17, 2013 when prices reached $86.46 per barrel. The period ended with the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts at $97.91 per barrel, up approximately 5.06% over the period. US12OF's per unit NAV started the period at $39.81 and ended the period at $43.19 on September 30, 2013, an increase of approximately 8.49% over the period. US12OF's per unit NAV reached its high for the period on August 28, 2013 at $44.90 and reached its low for the period on April 17, 2013 at $36.90. The average Benchmark Oil Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2013 to January 2014 contracts and ended with the November 2013 to October 2014 contracts. The increase of approximately 5.06% on the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Oil Futures Contracts. An investment in Oil Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing crude Oil Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the period to the end of the period, does not represent the actual benchmark results that US12OF seeks to track, which are more fully described below in the section titled "Tracking US12OF's Benchmark."  During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, crude oil moved into a mild state of backwardation, meaning that the price of the near month crude Oil Futures Contract was greater than the price of the next month crude Oil Futures Contract, and contracts further away from expiration. Crude oil inventories, which reached historic levels in January 2009 and February 2009 and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango, began to drop in March 2009 and continued to drop for the remainder of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2011, crude oil inventories began to climb higher, which contributed to the crude oil futures market remaining in contango through the end of December 2011. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, crude oil inventories began to draw down from present levels which contributed to the crude oil futures market moving into backwardation through the end of September 2013. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see "Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns" below.  Valuation of Oil Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Unit NAV  The per unit NAV of US12OF's units is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per unit NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. US12OF's administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the nymex or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts held on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other US12OF investments, including ICE Futures contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.  Results of Operations and the Crude Oil Market  Results of Operations. On December 6, 2007, US12OF listed its units on the American Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") under the ticker symbol "USL." On that day, US12OF established its initial offering price at $50.00 per unit and issued 300,000 units to the initial authorized purchaser in exchange for $15,000,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition of the AMEX by NYSE Euronext, US12OF's units no longer trade on the AMEX and commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on November 25, 2008.  Since its initial offering of 11,000,000 units, US12OF has registered one subsequent offering of its units: 100,000,000 units which were registered with the SEC on March 31, 2009. Units offered by US12OF in the subsequent offerings were sold by it for cash at the units' per unit NAV as described in the applicable prospectus. As of September 30, 2013, US12OF had issued 14,200,000 units, 1,800,000 of which were outstanding. As of September 30, 2013, there were 96,800,000 units registered but not yet issued.  More units may have been issued by US12OF than are outstanding due to the redemption of units. Unlike funds that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, units that have been redeemed by US12OF cannot be resold by US12OF. As a result, US12OF contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.  . . .

Fund Details
The United States Oil Fund® LP (USO) is an exchange-traded security designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil. USO issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
The investment objective of USO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of USO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less USO's expenses.
USO's Benchmark is the near month crude oil futures contract traded on the NYMEX. If the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The crude oil contract is WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
USO invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oil-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
USO's Fund Benefits

USO offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
USO provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
USO provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

USCF Launches The United States 3X Oil Fund and The United States 3X Short Oil Fund (Tickers:  USOU, USOD)






Jul 20, 2017, 9:15am EDT














OAKLAND, Calif., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, USCF launched the United States 3X Oil Fund (USOU) and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund (USOD).  Both funds are exchange-traded products that issue shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.  USOU seeks a return that is 300% of the return of the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil futures contract and USOD seeks a return that is -300% of the return of the WTI light, sweet crude oil futures contract.

They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.
Commodity ETP Disclosures:Download a copy of a Fund's Prospectus by clicking one of the following: ( USO, USOU, USL, DNO, USOD, UNG, UNL, UGA, UHN, BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG). Please read any Prospectus carefully before investing.

Investing in commodity interests subject each Fund to the risks of its related industry. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment. These risks could result in large fluctuations in the price of a particular Fund's respective shares. Funds that focus on a single sector generally experience greater volatility. For further discussion of these and additional risks associated with an investment in the Funds please read the respective Fund Prospectus before investing.

	*Principal
	U.S. Listing Exchange: NYSE Arca, Inc.





	The United
	States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (“USL”) is an exchange traded fund organized as a limited partnership that issues shares
	that trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange (“NYSE Arca”). USL’s investment objective is to track a benchmark
	of short-term oil futures contracts. USL pays its general partner, United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), a limited
	liability company, a management fee and incurs operating costs. Both USCF and USL are located at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530,
	Oakland, CA 94612. The telephone number for both USCF and USL is 510.522.9600. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares
	to break even over the next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $19.73 (the net asset value as of February 28, 2017), the investment
	would have to generate 0.40% return or $0.077, rounded to $0.08.




	USL is
	an exchange traded fund. This means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of USL shares place their trade orders
	through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shares trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker
	symbol “USL” and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities.




	Shares
	trade on the NYSE Arca after they are initially purchased by “Authorized Participants,” institutional firms that purchase
	shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called “baskets” through USL’s marketing agent, ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the
	“Marketing Agent”). The price of a basket is equal to the net asset value (“NAV”) of 50,000 shares on
	the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the Marketing Agent. The NAV per share is calculated by taking the
	current market value of USL’s total assets (after close of NYSE Arca) subtracting any liabilities and dividing that total
	by the total number of outstanding shares. The offering of USL’s shares is a “best efforts” offering, which
	means that neither the Marketing Agent nor any Authorized Participant is required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount
	of shares. USCF pays the Marketing Agent a marketing fee consisting of a fixed annual amount plus an incentive fee based on the
	amount of shares sold. Authorized Participants will not receive from USL, USCF or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation
	in connection with the sale of shares. Aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related
	services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of the offering.




	Investors
	who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the
	underlying oil futures contracts in which USL invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market
	for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of crude oil and the oil
	futures contracts that serve as USL’s investment benchmark. Investing in USL involves risks similar to those involved with
	an investment directly in the oil market, the correlation risk described above, and other significant risks. See “

	Risk
	Factors Involved with an Investment in USL

	” beginning on page 4.




	The offering
	of USL’s shares is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in accordance with the Securities
	Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering and is not expected to terminate
	until all of the registered shares have been sold or three years from the date of the original offering, whichever is earlier,
	unless extended as permitted under the rules under the 1933 Act, although the offering may be temporarily suspended if and when
	no suitable investments for USL are available or practicable. USL is not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company
	Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under such Act.





	NEITHER
	THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, OR DETERMINED
	IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.





	USL is
	a commodity pool and USCF is a commodity pool operator subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
	National Futures Association under the Commodities Exchange Act.





	THE
	COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS POOL NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED

	COMMODITY
	FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION






	RISK
	DISCLOSURE STATEMENT






	YOU
	SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION PERMITS YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMODITY POOL. IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD
	BE AWARE THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE
	THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS
	MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL.






	FURTHER,
	COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR
	THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS.
	THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED THIS POOL AT PAGE
	30 AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT,
	AT PAGE 31.






	THIS
	BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL.
	THEREFORE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMODITY POOL, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, INCLUDING
	THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE 4.






	YOU
	SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY TRADE FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED
	OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER
	DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE
	TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE TRANSACTIONS
	FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.






	SWAPS
	TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR
	SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS
	INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OPERATIONAL
	RISK.






	HIGHLY
	CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY
	LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE
	OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.






	IN
	EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT
	A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON INDIVIDUALLY
	NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE POOL’S
	OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOL’S EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY






	This
	is only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material information about USL and its shares, it does not contain
	or summarize all of the information about USL and the shares contained in this prospectus that is material and/or which may be
	important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including “Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in USL”
	beginning on page 4, before making an investment decision about the shares. For
	a glossary of defined terms, see Appendix A.






	USL





	United
	States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (“USL”), a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that continuously issues
	common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca stock exchange (“NYSE Arca”).
	USL is managed and controlled by United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), a Delaware limited liability company.
	USCF is registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”)
	and is a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”).










	USL’s Investment
	Objective and Strategy





	The investment
	objective of USL is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect
	the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured
	by the daily changes in the average of the prices of specified short-term futures contracts on light, sweet crude oil called the
	“Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts,” less USL’s expenses.






	What Are the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts”?





	 




	The Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are the futures contracts on light, sweet crude oil as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the “NYMEX”) that is the near month contract to expire, and the contracts for the following 11 months, for a total of 12 consecutive months’ contracts, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the following 11 consecutive months. When calculating the daily movement of the average price of the 12 contracts, each contract month is equally weighted.







	USL seeks to achieve its investment
	objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil,
	gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Exchange or other U.S. and foreign
	exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements
	or in view of market conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward
	contracts for oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”) transactions
	that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively,
	“Other Oil-Related Investments”). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USL to invest in Other
	Oil-Related Investments include those allowing USL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable
	pricing. (For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments collectively
	are referred to as “Oil Interests” in this prospectus.)




	In addition,
	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in USL’s share price on the NYSE Arca on a percentage
	basis to closely track daily changes in USL’s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further believes that the daily
	changes in the average prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts have historically closely tracked the daily changes in prices
	of light, sweet crude oil. USCF believes that the net effect of these relationships will be that the daily changes in the price
	of USL’s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will closely track the daily changes in the spot price of a barrel
	of light, sweet crude oil on a percentage basis, less USL’s expenses.




	Specifically,
	USL seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USL’s NAV for
	any period of 30 successive valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change
	in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts over the same period.

	Investors
	should be aware that USL’s investment objective is

	not

	for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar
	terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light, sweet crude oil,

	nor

	is USL’s investment objective for the percentage change in its NAV to reflect the percentage change of the price of any
	particular futures contract as measured over a time period

	greater than one day

	. This is because natural market forces
	called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in USL’s shares during the past year relative
	to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price
	of USL’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and
	backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning
	and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)







	Principal Investment Risks
	of an Investment in USL





	An investment
	in USL involves a degree of risk. Some of the risks you may face are summarized below. A more extensive discussion of these risks
	appears beginning on page 4.





	Investment Risk





	Investors
	may choose to use USL as a means of investing indirectly in crude oil. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the
	crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate.





	Correlation Risk





	To the
	extent that investors use USL as a means of indirectly investing in crude oil, there is the risk that the daily changes in the
	price of USL’s shares on the NYSE Arca on a percentage basis will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price
	of light, sweet crude oil on a percentage basis. This could happen if the price of shares traded on the NYSE Arca does not correlate
	closely with the value of USL’s NAV; the changes in USL’s NAV do not correlate closely with the changes in the average
	price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, or the changes in the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts do not
	closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil. This is a risk because if these correlations do not
	exist, then investors may not be able to use USL as a cost-effective way to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against
	the risk of loss in crude oil-related transactions.




	USCF
	believes that holding futures contracts whose expiration dates are spread out over a 12 month period of time will cause the total
	return of such a portfolio to vary compared to a portfolio that holds only a single month’s contract (such as the near month
	contract). In particular, USCF believes that the total return of a portfolio holding contracts with a range of expiration months
	will be impacted differently by the price relationship between different contract months of the same commodity future compared
	to the total return of a portfolio consisting of the near month contract. For example, in cases in which the near month contract’s
	price is higher than the price of contracts that expire later in time (a situation known as “backwardation” in the
	futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the near month contract would
	tend to rise as it approaches expiration. Conversely, in cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower than the
	price of contracts that expire later in time (a situation known as “contango” in the futures markets), then absent
	the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the near month contract would tend to decline as it approaches
	expiration. The total return of a portfolio that owned the near month contract and “rolled” forward each month by
	selling the near month contract as it approached expiration and purchasing the next month contract to expire would be positively
	impacted by a backwardation market, and negatively impacted by a contango market. Depending on the exact price relationship of
	the different month’s prices, portfolio expenses, and the overall movement of crude oil prices, the impact of backwardation
	and contango could have a major impact on the total return of such a portfolio over time. USCF believes that based on historical
	evidence a portfolio that held futures contracts with a range of expiration dates spread out over a 12 month period of time would
	typically be impacted less by the positive effect of backwardation and the negative effect of contango compared to a portfolio
	that held contracts of a single near month. As a result, absent the impact of any other factors, a portfolio of 12 different monthly
	contracts would tend to have a lower total return than a near month only portfolio in a backwardation market and a higher total
	return in a contango market. However there can be no assurance that such historical relationships would provide the same or similar
	results in the future.





	Tax Risk





	USL is
	organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of its limited partnership agreement and applicable
	state law, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than conventional mutual funds.









	2










	 









	Over-the-Counter (“OTC”)
	Contract Risk





	USL may
	also invest in Other Oil-Related Investments, many of which are negotiated or “OTC” contracts that are not as liquid
	as Oil Futures Contracts and expose USL to credit risk that its counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to USL.





	Other Risks





	USL pays fees and expenses
	that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable.




	Unlike
	mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains
	and distribute such income and gains to their investors, USL generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders.
	You should not invest in USL if you will need cash distributions from USL to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of USL,
	if any, or for any other reason.




	You will
	have no rights to participate in the management of USL and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to manage USL.




	USL is
	subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
	USCF’s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to USL. USCF’s persons are directors,
	officers or employees of other entities that may compete with USL for their services, including other commodity pools (funds)
	that USCF manages (these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “Related Public Funds” and are identified
	in the Glossary). USCF could have a conflict between its responsibilities to USL and to those other entities. As a result of these
	and other relationships, parties involved with USL have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests
	of USL and the shareholders.

	RISK
	FACTORS INVOLVED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN USL






	You
	should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information
	included in this prospectus as well as information found in our periodic reports, which include USL’s financial statements
	and the related notes, that are incorporated by reference. See “Incorporation By Reference of Certain Information,”
	page 57.




	USL's investment objective is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes
	of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, plus interest earned on USL's collateral holdings, less USL's expenses. USL seeks to achieve
	its investment objective by investing so that the average daily percentage change in USL's NAV for any period of 30 successive
	valuation days will be within plus/minus ten percent (10%) of the average daily percentage change in the price of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contract over the same period. USL's investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a cost-effective
	way to invest indirectly in crude oil and to hedge against movements in the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. An investment
	in USL involves investment risk similar to a direct investment in Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments,
	and correlation risk, or the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will
	have an efficient hedge only if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil. In addition
	to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in USL involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks.






	Investment Risk






	The
	NAV of USL’s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other assets held by USL and
	fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect an investment in USL’s shares. Past performance
	is not necessarily indicative of futures results; all or substantially all of an investment in USL could be lost.





	The net
	assets of USL consist primarily of investments in Oil Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Oil-Related Investments.
	The NAV of USL’s shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid expenses),
	which in turn relates to the price of light, sweet crude oil in the marketplace. Crude oil prices depend on local, regional and
	global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for oil.






	Economic
	conditions impacting light, sweet crude oil



	.

	The demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic
	growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse
	impact on crude oil prices. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes
	in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can
	also impact the demand for crude oil. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal
	constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union,
	and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the
	demand for crude oil.






	Other
	light, sweet crude oil demand-related factors



	.

	Other factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore
	its price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for crude
	oil associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
	been competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences
	that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.






	Other
	light, sweet crude oil supply-related factors



	.

	Crude oil prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting
	supply. For example, increased supply from the development of new oil supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from
	existing sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in
	demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil.
	World oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by member countries
	to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) production quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile
	actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels
	that may disrupt supplies.








	4










	 







	Technological
	change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to manufacture
	petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand for oil.






	Other
	factors impacting the light, sweet crude oil market



	.

	The supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted
	by changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions, as well as by the development of alternative
	energy sources.






	Price
	volatility may possibly cause the total loss of your investment



	.

	Futures contracts have a high degree of price
	variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all
	of your investment in USL.







	Correlation Risk





	Investors
	purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors
	pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil. Investing in USL’s shares for hedging purposes involves
	the following risks:








	•




	The
	market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly less or
	more than NAV.










	•




	Daily
	percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in
	the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Future Contracts.










	•




	Daily
	percentage changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts
	may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of light, sweet
	crude oil.








	The market price at
	which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly less or more than NAV.






	USL’s
	NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in the market value of USL’s portfolio investments. The
	public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV
	of the shares. Price differences may relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for
	shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the light, sweet crude oil
	and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities
	by Authorized Participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share
	closely over time, but there can be no assurance of that.




	The NAV
	of USL’s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures exchanges
	on which crude oil is traded. While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours
	for the futures exchanges on which sweet light crude oil trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time. For example,
	while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the global light, sweet crude market will be
	reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the
	futures exchanges on which sweet, light crude oil is traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount
	on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price of the shares and the NAV of the shares.






	Daily percentage changes
	in USL’s NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.






	It is
	possible that the daily percentage changes in USL’s NAV per share may not closely correlate to daily percentage changes
	in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts. Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the
	market for light, sweet crude oil, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary
	circumstances. As USL approaches or reaches position limits with respect to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other Oil
	Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, USL may begin investing in Other Oil-Related Investments. In addition, USL
	is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts because the total return
	generated by USL is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with USL’s trading
	activities, and increased by interest income from USL’s holdings of Treasuries (defined below). Tracking the Benchmark Oil
	Futures Contracts requires trading of USL’s portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts over time
	and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.








	5










	 









	Daily percentage changes
	in the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price
	of light, sweet crude oil.






	The correlation
	between changes in the average prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only
	approximate. The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market,
	supply of and demand for Oil Futures Contracts (including the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts) and Other Oil-Related Investments,
	and technical influences in oil futures trading.






	Natural forces in the
	oil futures market known as “backwardation” and “contango” may increase USL’s tracking error and/or
	negatively impact total return.






	The design
	of USL’s Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts consists of the near month contract to expire and the contracts for the 11 following
	months, which are changed to the next month contract to expire and the contracts for the 11 following months during one day each
	month. In the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire
	contracts, a situation described as “backwardation” in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement
	in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. Conversely, in the event
	of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation described
	as “contango” in the futures market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value
	of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration. When compared to total return of other price indices,
	such as the spot price of crude oil, the impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of USL’s per share
	NAV to vary significantly. Moreover, absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices, a prolonged period of contango could have
	a significant negative impact on USL’s per share NAV and total return and investors could lose part or all of their investment.
	See “Additional Information About USL, its Investment Objective and Investments” for a discussion of the potential
	effects of contango and backwardation.






	Accountability levels,
	position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could
	cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.






	Designated
	contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum
	net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control
	(other than as a hedge, which an investment by USL is not) may hold, own or control. In addition to accountability levels and
	position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit
	establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement
	price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price
	beyond that limit.




	The accountability
	levels for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other Oil Futures Contracts traded on U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as
	the NYMEX, are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over
	an investor’s positions. The current accountability level for investments for any one-month in the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contracts is 10,000 contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 20,000 net futures contracts
	for light, sweet crude oil. In addition, the ICE Futures maintains the same accountability levels, position limits and monitoring
	authority for its light, sweet crude oil contract as the NYMEX. If USL and the Related Public Funds exceed these accountability
	levels for investments in the futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor such exposure
	and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy,
	and the extent of liquidity resources of USL and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures,
	USL could be ordered to reduce its net oil futures contracts back to the accountability level. As of December 31, 2016, USL held
	2,247 NYMEX Crude Oil Futures CL contracts. As of December 31, 2016, USL did not hold any Oil Futures Contracts traded on the
	ICE Futures. For the year ended December 31, 2016, USL did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the NYMEX or ICE Futures,
	however, the aggregated total of the Related Public Funds did exceed the accountability levels. No action was taken by NYMEX and
	USL did not reduce the number of Oil Futures Contracts held as a result.




	Position
	limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any
	person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability
	levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held
	in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that USL will run up against such position
	limits because USL’s investment strategy is to close out its positions and “roll” from the near month contracts
	to expire to the next month contracts during a one-day period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contracts. For the year
	ended December 31, 2016, USL did not exceed any position limits imposed by the NYMEX and ICE Futures.

	The CFTC
	has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 25 physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are
	economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the “Position Limit Rules”).
	The Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds
	that restrict the size of speculative positions that a person may hold in the spot month, other individual months, and all months
	combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated
	contract markets (“DCMs”) and swap execution facilities (“SEFs”) to establish position limits or, in some
	cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well
	as certain non-U.S. located platforms. The CFTC’s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules, in 2011, was successfully
	challenged by market participants in 2012 and, since then, the CFTC has reproposed them and solicited comments from market participants
	multiple times. At this time, it is unclear how the Position Limit Rules may affect USL, but the effect may be substantial and
	adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of USL to meet its investment objectives
	through limits that may inhibit USCF’s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of USL.




	Until
	such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position
	Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related. Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation
	in nine agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges establish and enforce position limits and accountability
	levels for other agricultural products and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, USL may be limited
	with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.




	Under
	existing and recently adopted CFTC regulations, for the purpose of position limits, a market participant is generally required,
	subject to certain narrow exceptions, to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with
	all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as
	the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding with that market participant
	(the “Aggregation Rules”). The Aggregation Rules will also apply with respect to the Position Limit Rules if and when
	such Position Limit Rules are adopted.




	All of
	these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of USL’s shares and the average of the prices of the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts. This may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use USL as a way to hedge against
	crude oil-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil.




	USL has
	not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts
	and Other Oil-Related Investments. If USL encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Oil
	Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Oil
	Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its
	investment objective. In addition, if USL exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by
	such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of USL’s
	shares and the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.







	Tax Risk







	An investor’s
	tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.






	Cash
	or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other
	distributions with respect to shares. Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local,
	or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of USL’s taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions
	or the amount of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount
	of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.






	An investor’s
	allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its shares.






	Due to
	the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by USL in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an
	investor’s allocable share of USL’s income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss
	from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being
	taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.








	7










	 











	Items of income, gain,
	deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017,
	USL could be liable for U.S. federal income tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not accept the
	assumptions and conventions applied by USL in allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an investor.






	The U.S.
	tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large, publicly traded partnerships such as USL is in
	many respects uncertain. USL applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable
	rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders’
	economic gains and losses. These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code
	(the “Code”) and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge
	USL’s allocation methods and require USL to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that
	adversely affects investors. If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes
	plus deficiency interest.




	In addition,
	for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, USL may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any “imputed understatement”
	of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases
	in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit
	to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor
	or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If USL is required to pay any U.S. federal
	income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of USL and would likely have
	an adverse impact on the value of the shares. Under certain circumstances, USL may be eligible to make an election to cause the
	investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties. The ability of
	a publicly traded partnership such as USL to make this election is uncertain. If the election is made, USL would be required to
	provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement
	setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment (“Adjusted K-1s”). The investors would be required to take
	the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s are issued.






	USL could be treated
	as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.






	USL has
	received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, USL will be treated as a partnership that is
	not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of USL’s annual
	gross income will be derived from (x) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory) or futures, forwards, options,
	swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (y) interest income, (ii) USL is organized and operated
	in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) USL does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal
	income tax purposes. Although USCF anticipates that USL has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the “qualifying income”
	requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured. USL has not requested and will not request any ruling
	from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
	If the IRS were to successfully assert that USL is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year,
	rather than passing through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, USL would be subject to
	tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates. In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions
	with respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income. Taxation of USL as a corporation
	could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.






	USL is organized and
	operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore,
	USL has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.






	USL is
	organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by USL on its income. Instead, USL will furnish shareholders each year with tax information
	on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable
	share of the income, gain, loss and deduction of USL.




	This
	must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from USL
	during the taxable year. A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated income or gain by USL but receive no cash distribution with
	which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.








	8










	 









	In addition
	to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business
	taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in
	which USL does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not
	presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in USL. It is each shareholder’s
	responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.






	If USL is required to
	withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S. shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all shareholders.






	Under
	certain circumstances, USL may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders. Although
	the LP Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, USL may
	not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts
	were withheld since it does not generally expect to make any distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the
	withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could
	have a material impact on the value of the shares.







	OTC Contract Risk







	Currently, OTC transactions
	are subject to changing regulation.






	A portion
	of USL’s assets may be used to trade OTC contracts, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts. OTC contracts are
	typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money
	center and investment banks and other institutions. The markets for OTC contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants
	in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets. While certain regulations adopted
	over the past several years are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the OTC market, complying with such
	regulations could have substantial and adverse effects on USL.






	USL will be subject
	to credit risk with respect to counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by USL or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.






	USL faces
	the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these
	contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of
	financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may
	not be able to meet its obligations to USL, in which case USL could suffer significant losses on these contracts.




	If a
	counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, USL may experience
	significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. USL may obtain only limited recovery
	or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.






	Valuing OTC derivatives
	may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments.






	In general,
	valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts
	and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated
	are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources.
	In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts,
	they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result,
	it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.







	Other Risks







	Certain of USL’s
	investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.






	Futures
	positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there
	is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political
	actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil production or exports, or another major export, can also make
	it difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments may be illiquid, USL’s
	Oil Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred
	during the period in which positions are being liquidated. The large size of the positions that USL may acquire increases the
	risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying
	to do so.








	9










	 











	OTC contracts
	that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange,
	do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability
	of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. These
	conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely
	impact USL’s ability to realize the full value of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty
	credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default
	since the collateral held may not cover a party’s exposure on the transaction in such situations.






	USL is not actively managed
	and tracks the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts during periods in which the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are flat
	or declining as well as when the prices are rising.






	USL is
	not actively managed by conventional methods. Accordingly, if USL’s investments in Oil Interests are declining in value,
	USL will not close out such positions except in connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant upon the redemption
	of a basket or closing out futures positions in connection with the monthly change in a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. USCF will
	seek to cause the NAV of USL’s shares to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts during periods in which its price is
	flat or declining as well as when the price is rising.






	The NYSE Arca may halt
	trading in USL’s shares, which would adversely impact an investor’s ability to sell shares.






	USL’s
	shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca under the market symbol “USL.” Trading in shares may be halted due
	to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading
	in shares inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to
	“circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
	Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of USL’s shares will continue
	to be met or will remain unchanged.




	The liquidity
	of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants, which could adversely affect
	the market price of the shares.




	In the
	event that one or more Authorized Participants which have substantial interests in the shares withdraw from participation, the
	liquidity of the shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and result in investors
	incurring a loss on their investment.




	Shareholders
	that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their shares in secondary trading markets, and the conditions associated
	with trading in secondary markets may adversely affect investors’ investment in the shares.




	Only Authorized
	Participants may create or redeem Redemption Baskets. All other investors that desire to purchase or sell shares must do so through
	the NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the shares may be traded. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to NAV
	per share.






	The lack of an active
	trading market for USL’s shares may result in losses on an investor’s investment in USL at the time the investor sells
	the shares.






	Although
	USL’s shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares
	will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the
	investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active market
	existed.






	Limited partners may
	have limited liability in certain circumstances, including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions.






	Under
	Delaware law, a limited partner might be held liable for USL’s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited
	partner participates in the control of the partnership’s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership
	think the limited partner is the general partner.








	10










	 









	A limited
	partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of USL’s shares. However,
	a limited partner may be required to repay to USL any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances.
	Under Delaware law, USL may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes USL’s liabilities (other
	than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities) to exceed the fair value of
	USL’s assets. Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the
	distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution
	for three years from the date of the distribution.






	The
	LLC Agreement provides limited authority to the Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed by USCF’s
	parent company, which is wholly owned by Concierge, a controlled public company where the majority of shares are owned by Nicholas
	Gerber along with certain other family members and certain other shareholders.






	USCF’s
	Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors, each of whom are also executive officers or employees of USCF,
	and three Non-Management Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of applicable NYSE Arca and SEC rules.
	Under USCF’s LLC Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as the Management Directors expressly
	confer upon them, which means that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to control the actions of the Management
	Directors than is typically the case with the independent members of a company’s Board of Directors. In addition, any Director
	may be removed by written consent of Wainwright Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”), which is the sole member of USCF. The
	sole shareholder of Wainwright is Concierge Technologies Inc., a company publicly traded under the ticker symbol “CNCG”
	(“Concierge”). Mr. Nicholas Gerber along with certain family members and certain other shareholders, own the majority
	of the shares in Concierge, which is the sole shareholder of Wainright, the sole member of USCF. Accordingly, although USCF is
	governed by the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to
	the LLC Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his indirect control of Wainwright to effect the removal of
	any Director (including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit Committee) and to replace that Director with another
	Director. Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF and USL, including their regulatory obligations.




	There is a
	risk that USL will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such USL
	may not earn any profit.




	USL pays
	brokerage charges of approximately 0.01% of average total net assets based on brokerage fees of $3.50 per buy or sell, management
	fees of 0.60% of NAV on its average net assets, and OTC spreads and extraordinary expenses (e.g., subsequent offering expenses,
	other expenses not in the ordinary course of business, including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations
	to the extent permitted by law and required under the LP Agreement and under agreements entered into by USCF on USL’s behalf
	and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring
	of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation) that cannot be quantified. 




	These
	fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether USL’s activities are profitable. Accordingly, USL must
	earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.






	Regulation of the commodity
	interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but
	may significantly and adversely affect USL.






	The futures
	markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges
	are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation
	of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.
	Regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing
	modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment
	pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. In addition, various national governments outside of the United States
	have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate
	the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on USL is impossible to predict, but it could be
	substantial and adverse.






	An investment in USL
	may provide little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, USL may have no gains to offset losses from other
	investments, and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in USL while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.






	Historically,
	Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes
	such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of
	futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.








	11










	 







	However,
	there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, USL’s
	performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification
	benefits from an investment in USL’s shares. In such a case, USL may have no gains to offset losses from other investments,
	and investors may suffer losses on their investment in USL at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments.




	Variables
	such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and
	crude oil-linked instruments, including Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments, than on traditional securities. These
	additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject USL’s investments to greater volatility than investments
	in traditional securities.




	Non-correlation
	should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
	There is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds,
	are negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, USL cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during
	unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.






	USL is not a registered
	investment company so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.






	USL is
	not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute,
	which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship
	between the investment company and its investment manager.






	Trading in international
	markets could expose USL to credit and regulatory risk.






	USL invests
	primarily in Oil Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including the NYMEX.
	However, a portion of USL’s trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Some non-U.S. markets
	present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. Trading on such non-U.S.
	markets

	or exchanges presents risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation
	as their U.S. counterparts, including potentially different or diminished investor protections. In trading contracts denominated
	in currencies other than U.S. dollars,

	USL

	is subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate
	movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts

	. Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges
	is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines
	and political instability. An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the
	loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.






	USL and USCF may have
	conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.






	USL is
	subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and Authorized Participants.
	USCF’s officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to USL and are also directors, officers or
	employees of other entities that may compete with USL for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities
	to USL and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with USL have a financial incentive
	to act in a manner other than in the best interests of USL and the shareholders. USCF has not established any formal procedure
	to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to
	such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult,
	if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.




	USL may
	also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”), including, but not limited
	to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing
	positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM. In addition, USCF’s principals, officers, directors
	or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account. A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are
	in the same markets and at the same time as USL trades using the clearing broker to be used by USL. A potential conflict also
	may occur if USCF’s principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions
	in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by USL.








	12










	 









	USL could terminate at
	any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall maturity and
	timing of an investor’s investment portfolio.






	USL may
	terminate at any time, regardless of whether USL has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the LP Agreement. In particular,
	unforeseen circumstances, including the adjudication of incompetence, bankruptcy, dissolution, or removal of USCF as the general
	partner of USL, could cause USL to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within 90 days of the event elects
	to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner, or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the
	limited partners subject to certain conditions. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USL. USL’s termination
	would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor’s investment. Termination could also negatively affect the
	overall maturity and timing of an investor’s investment portfolio.






	USL does not expect to
	make cash distributions.






	USL has
	not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in additional Oil Interests rather than
	distributing cash to limited partners or other shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment
	pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute
	such income and gains to their investors, USL generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners. An investor should
	not invest in USL if the investor will need cash distributions from USL to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of USL,
	if any, or for any other reason. Nonetheless, although USL does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from
	its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution,

	e.g.,

	at levels where such
	income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Oil Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on
	such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this income becomes significant then cash distributions
	may be made.






	An unanticipated number
	of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on USL’s NAV.






	If a
	substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by USL during a relatively short period of time,
	USL may not be able to satisfy the requests from USL’s assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be necessary
	to liquidate positions in USL’s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.






	Money Market Reform






	The SEC adopted
	Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act on July 23, 2014, which became effective on October 14, 2016, to reform money market funds (“MMFs”).
	While the new rule applies only to MMFs, it may indirectly affect institutional investors such as USL. The new rule requires institutional
	prime MMFs to price their shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost method (i.e., to use a “floating
	net asset value per share” or “floating NAV”). Government and retail funds can continue to use the amortized
	cost method to value their portfolio securities. Additionally, liquidity fees and gates allow an MMF’s board of directors
	to directly address runs on a fund. MMFs’ boards of directors are required to implement rules to discourage and prevent
	runs by investors through the use of redemption fees and gates (temporary suspension of redemptions). The fees and gates could
	be imposed on a fund whose portfolios fail to meet certain liquidity thresholds although they are optional for government MMFs.
	USL currently invests in government MMFs, as well as Treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for
	assets not used for margin or collateral in the Oil Futures Contracts. USL does not hold any non-government MMFs and, currently,
	does not anticipate investing in any non-government MMFs. The new rule further decreases the likelihood that USL would invest
	in any non-governmental MMFs. However, if USL were to make investments in non-government MMFs in the future, such investments
	could negatively impact USL because of the changes to MMFs resulting from the new rule.  




	 






	The failure or bankruptcy
	of a clearing broker could result in a substantial loss of USL’s assets and could impair USL in its ability to execute trades.






	In the
	event of the bankruptcy of a clearing broker or an Exchange’s clearing house, USL could be exposed to a risk of loss with
	respect to its assets that are posted as margin. If such a bankruptcy were to occur, USL would be afforded the protections granted
	to customers of an FCM, and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy
	Code and applicable CFTC regulations. Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property
	held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange’s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange’s
	clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims. In any case, there can be no assurance that these protections will
	be effective in allowing USL to recover all, or even any, of the amounts it has deposited as margin.








	13










	 







	On January
	13, 2014, new regulations became effective relating to enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring
	and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and 20 examination programs for FCMs. There can
	be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, USL or
	its investors.




	Notwithstanding
	that USL could sustain losses upon the failure or bankruptcy of its FCM, the majority of USL’s assets are held in Treasuries,
	cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of an FCM.




	The failure
	or bankruptcy of USL’s Custodian could result in a substantial loss of USL’s assets.




	The majority
	of USL’s assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian. The insolvency of the Custodian
	could result in a complete loss of USL’s assets held by that Custodian, which, at any given time, would likely comprise
	a substantial portion of USL’s total assets.






	Third parties may infringe
	upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual
	property rights, which may result in significant costs and diverted attention.






	It is
	possible that third parties might utilize USL’s intellectual property or technology, including the use of its business methods,
	trademarks and trading program software, without permission. USCF has a patent for USL’s business method and has registered
	its trademarks. USL does not currently have any proprietary software. However, if it obtains proprietary software in the future,
	any unauthorized use of USL’s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage.
	USL may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents, trademarks, proprietary
	software and other technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software
	and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their intellectual property rights, including their
	copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future
	to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties’ proprietary rights, defend itself against
	claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights
	are invalid. Any litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs,
	divert its resources from USL, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or
	licensing agreements.






	Due to the increased
	use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber-attacks pose operational and information security risks.






	With the
	increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions,
	USL is susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks
	or unintentional events. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes
	of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also
	be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites.
	Cyber security failures or breaches of USL’s clearing broker or third party service provider (including, but not limited
	to, index providers, the administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business
	operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of USL shareholders to transact business, violations of applicable
	privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional
	compliance costs.




	In addition,
	substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. USL and its shareholders could be negatively
	impacted as a result. While USL has established business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such plans.










	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT
	USL, ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND INVESTMENTS





	USL is
	a Delaware limited partnership organized on June 27, 2007. It operates pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated
	Agreement of Limited Partnership dated as of March 1, 2013 (as amended from time to time, the “LP Agreement”), which
	grants full management control of USL to USCF. USL maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland,
	CA 94612.




	The net
	assets of USL consist primarily of investments in Oil Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory
	requirements or in view of market conditions, Other Oil-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates
	could cause USL to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing USL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute
	transactions with more favorable pricing.








	14










	 







	USL invests
	substantially the entire amount if its assets in Oil Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts
	of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States
	of two years or less (“Treasuries”), cash and cash equivalents. The daily holdings of USL are available on USL’s
	website at

	www.uscfinvestments.com

	.




	USL invests
	in Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or
	collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Oil Interests. In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF,
	is the investment in Oil Futures Contracts and the management of USL’s investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents
	for margining purposes and as collateral.




	USL seeks
	to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely
	track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, also measured in percentage terms. As a specific
	benchmark, USCF endeavors to place USL’s trades in Oil Interests and otherwise manage USL’s investments so that “A”
	will be within plus/ minus ten percent (10%) of “B”, where:








	•




	A
	is the average daily percentage change in USL’s per share NAV for any period of
	30 successive valuation days;

	i.e.

	, any NYSE Arca trading day as of which USL
	calculates its per share NAV; and










	•




	B
	is the average daily percentage change in the average of the prices of the Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contracts over the same period.






	USCF
	believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in USL’s share price on the NYSE Arca to closely
	track the daily changes in USL’s NAV per share. USCF further believes that the daily changes in USL’s NAV in percentage
	terms will closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, less
	USL’s expenses.




	The
	following two graphs demonstrate the correlation between the changes in USL’s NAV and the changes in the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contract. The first graph exhibits the daily changes in the last 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2016. The second graph measures
	monthly changes from December 11, 2011 through December 31, 2016.

	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS









	USCF
	employs a “neutral” investment strategy in order to track changes in the average prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contracts regardless of whether these prices go up or go down. USL’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed
	to permit investors generally to purchase and sell USL’s shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in
	a cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the oil or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude
	oil-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated
	with investing in crude oil and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in USL involves the risk
	that the daily changes in the price of USL’s shares, in percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in
	the average prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, in percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Oil Futures
	Contracts, in percentage terms, will not closely correlate with daily changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil, in
	percentage terms.




	As an example, for the two months ended February 28, 2017, the actual total return of USL as measured by changes in its per
	share NAV was (3.24)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $20.39 as of December 31, 2016 and an ending per share
	NAV as of February 28, 2017 of $19.73. During this time period, USL made no distributions to its shareholders. However, if
	USL's daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the Benchmark
	Futures Contract, USL would have had an estimated per share NAV of $19.75 as of February 28, 2017, for a total return over
	the relevant time period of (3.14)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USL of (3.24)% and the
	expected total return based on the Benchmark Futures Contracts of (3.14)% was an error over the time period of (0.10)%, which
	is to say that USL's actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage. USL incurs expenses primarily
	composed of the management fee, brokerage commissions for the buying and selling of futures contracts, and other expenses.
	The impact of these expenses tends to cause daily changes in the per share NAV of USL to track slightly lower than daily changes
	in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract.







	Impact
	of Contango and Backwardation on Total Returns





	Several
	factors determine the total return from investing in futures contracts. One factor arises from “rolling” futures contracts
	that will expire at the end of the current month (the “near” or “front” month contract) forward each month
	prior to expiration. For a strategy that entails holding the near month contract, the price relationship between that futures
	contract and the next month futures contract will impact returns. For example, if the price of the near month futures contract
	is higher than the next futures month contract (a situation referred to as “backwardation”), then absent any other
	change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to rise in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches
	expiration. Conversely, if the price of a near month futures contract is lower than the next month futures contract (a situation
	referred to as “contango”), then absent any other change, the price of a next month futures contract tends to decline
	in value as it becomes the near month futures contract and approaches expiration.








	16










	 









	As an
	example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery, is $50 per barrel, and the value of a position in the near
	month futures contract is also $50. Over time, the price of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors, including
	demand for oil relative to supply. The value of the near month futures contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number
	of market factors. If an investor seeks to maintain a position in a near month futures contract and not take delivery of physical
	barrels of crude oil, the investor must sell the current near month futures contract as it approaches expiration and invest in
	the next month futures contract. In order to continue holding a position in the current near month futures contract, this “roll”
	forward of the futures contract must be executed every month.




	Contango
	and backwardation are natural market forces that have impacted the total return on an investment in USL’s shares during
	the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil. In the future, it is likely that the relationship between
	the market price of USL’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil will continue to be impacted by
	contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically
	owning and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.




	If the
	futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the price of the next
	month futures contract, the investor would buy a next month futures contract for a lower price than the current near month futures
	contract. Assuming the price of the next month futures contract was $49 per barrel, or 2% cheaper than the $50 near month futures
	contract, then, hypothetically, and assuming no other changes (e.g., to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship
	between the spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract, and, ignoring the impact of commission costs and
	the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the $49 next month futures contract would rise to $50 as it approaches
	expiration. In this example, the value of an investment in the next month futures contract would tend to outperform the spot price
	of crude oil. As a result, it would be possible for the new near month futures contract to rise 12% while the spot price of crude
	oil may have risen a lower amount, e.g., only 10%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value
	of an investment in the futures contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained
	constant, this difference between the spot price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.




	If the
	futures market is in contango, an investor would be buying a next month futures contract for a higher price than the current near
	month futures contract. Again, assuming the near month futures contract is $50 per barrel, the price of the next month futures
	contract might be $51 per barrel, or 2% more expensive than the front month futures contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no
	other changes, the value of the $51 next month futures contract would fall to $50 as it approaches expiration. In this example,
	the value of an investment in the second month would tend to underperform the spot price of crude oil. As a result, it would be
	possible for the new near month futures contract to rise only 10% while the spot price of crude oil may have risen a higher amount,
	e.g., 12%. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the second month futures
	contract might have fallen another amount, e.g., 12%. Over time, if contango remained constant, this difference between the spot
	price and the futures contract price would continue to increase.




	The chart
	below compares the daily price of the near month crude oil futures contract to the price of 13th month crude oil futures contract
	(i.e. a contract one year forward) over the last 10 years. When the price of the near month futures contract is higher than the
	price of the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in backwardation. When the price of the near
	month futures contract is lower than the 13th month futures contract, the market would be described as being in contango. Although
	the price of the near month futures contract and the price of the 13th month futures contract tend to move together, it can be
	seen that at times the near month futures contract prices are higher than the 13th month futures contract prices (backwardation)
	and, at other times, the near month futures contract prices are lower than the 13th month futures contract prices (contango).

	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	An alternative
	way to view the same data is to subtract the dollar price of the 13th month crude oil futures contract from the dollar price of
	the near month crude oil futures contract, as shown in the chart below. When the difference is positive, the market is in backwardation.
	When the difference is negative, the market is in contango. The crude oil market spent time in both backwardation and contango
	during the last ten years.

	*PAST
	PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	An investment
	in a portfolio that owned only the near month crude oil futures contract would likely produce a different result than an investment
	in a portfolio that owned an equal number of each of the near 12 months’ of crude oil futures contracts. Generally speaking,
	when the crude oil futures market is in backwardation, a portfolio of only the near month crude oil futures contract may tend
	to have a higher total return than a portfolio of 12 months’ of the crude oil futures contract. Conversely, if the crude
	oil futures market was in contango, the portfolio containing only 12 months’ of crude oil futures contracts may tend to
	outperform the portfolio holding only the near month crude oil futures contract.




	Historically,
	the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly
	as often as contango since oil futures trading, started in 1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter of
	2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009, the
	level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the
	physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led
	to unusually high inventories of crude oil. A combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along with growing
	demand for crude oil globally, moderated the inventory build-up and lead to reduced levels of contango by 2011. However, at the
	end of November, 2014, global crude oil inventories grew rapidly after OPEC decided to defend its market share against U.S. shale-oil
	producers, resulting in another period during which the crude oil market remained primarily in contango, sometimes steep contango.
	This period of contango continued through December 31, 2016. In addition, the crude oil markets are expected to remain in contango
	until U.S. and global oil inventories decline significantly. If OPEC’s recent cuts in oil production have their intended
	effect on the crude oil market then such a decline may occur in 2017.








	19










	 











	USCF
	believes that holding futures contracts whose expiration dates are spread out over a 12 month period of time will cause the total
	return of such a portfolio to vary compared to a portfolio that holds only a single month’s contract (such as the near month
	contract). In particular, USCF believes that the total return of a portfolio holding contracts with a range of expiration months
	will be impacted differently by the price relationship between different contract months of the same commodity future compared
	to the total return of a portfolio consisting of the near month contract. USCF believes that based on historical evidence a portfolio
	that held futures contracts with a range of expiration dates spread out over a 12 month period of time would typically be impacted
	less by the positive effect of backwardation, and less by the negative effect of contango, compared to a portfolio that held contracts
	of a single near month. As a result, absent the impact of any other factors, a portfolio of 12 different monthly contracts would
	tend to have a lower total return than a near month only portfolio in a backwardation market and a higher total return in a contango
	market. However there can be no assurance that such historical relationships would provide the same or similar results in the
	future.




	Periods
	of contango or backwardation do not materially impact USL’s investment objective of having the daily percentage changes
	in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the average of the prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts since
	the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both USL’s shares
	and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango
	will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.




	In managing
	USL’s assets USCF does not use a technical trading system that issues buy and sell orders. USCF instead employs a quantitative
	methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Oil Interests, such as the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts,
	that have an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of Treasuries and/or cash received upon the issuance of the Creation
	Basket.




	The specific
	Oil Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors, including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification
	of USL’s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of
	particular contracts. In addition, USL may make use of a mixture of standard sized futures contracts as well as the smaller sized
	“mini” contracts. While USCF has made significant investments in NYMEX Oil Futures Contracts, for various reasons,
	including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market, position limits or other regulatory
	requirements limiting USL’s holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges
	or invest in Other Oil-Related Investments. To the extent that USL invests in Other Oil-Related Investments, it would prioritize
	investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, including cleared
	swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts,
	instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the “OTC market”).
	If USL is required by law or regulation, or by one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its position in
	the Futures Contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate
	it would be more appropriate to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments, a substantial portion of USL’s assets could be
	invested in accordance with such priority in Other Oil-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return on the Futures
	Contracts. As USL’s assets reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits, accountability levels or other
	regulatory limits and, as a result, it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in Other Oil-Related
	Investments at such higher levels. In addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USL to invest in
	Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing USL to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable
	pricing. See “Risk Factors Involved With an Investment in USL” for a discussion of the potential impact of the regulation
	on USL’s ability to invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.




	USCF
	may not be able to fully invest USL’s assets in the Oil Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal
	to USL’s NAV. For example, as standardized contracts, the Futures Contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity,
	and USL’s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of
	those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, USL may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes
	in price of the Benchmark Oil




	Futures
	Contracts through the use of Other Oil-Related Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation with changes in
	price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.




	USL anticipates
	that to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts other than contracts on light, sweet crude oil (such as futures contracts
	for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels) and Other Oil-Related Investments, it will enter into various
	non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to hedge the short-term price movements of such Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related
	Investments against the current Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.








	20










	 











	USCF
	does not anticipate letting USL’s Oil Futures Contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead,
	USCF closes existing positions, e.g., when it changes the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments or
	it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related
	Investments. Positions may also be closed out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets
	will not be reinvested.




	The Benchmark
	Oil Futures Contracts are changed from the near month contract to expire and the 11 following months to the next month contract
	to expire and the 11 following months during one day each month. On that day, USCF “rolls” USL’s positions by
	closing, or selling, USL’s Oil Interests and reinvests the proceeds from closing these positions in new Oil Interests.




	The anticipated
	dates on which the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are changed and USL’s Oil Interests are “rolled” will be
	posted on USL’s website at www.uscfinvestments.com, and are subject to change without notice.




	By remaining
	invested as fully as possible in Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related Investments, USCF believes that the changes in percentage
	terms in USL’s per share NAV will continue to closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the average of the
	prices of the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts. USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result in the price
	of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking the per share NAV of USL. Additionally, Oil Futures Contracts traded on
	the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes
	that the changes in the price of USL’s shares traded on the NYSE Arca have closely tracked on a daily basis and will continue
	to closely track the changes in the spot price of light, sweet crude oil, on a percentage basis.







	What are the Trading Policies
	of USL?







	Liquidity






	USL invests
	only in Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit
	the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Oil-Related Investments that, in the opinion
	of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of USL.






	Spot Commodities






	While
	the Oil Futures Contracts traded can be physically settled, USL does not intend to take or make physical delivery. USL may from
	time to time trade in Other Oil-Related Investments, including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil.






	Leverage






	USCF
	endeavors to have the value of USL’s Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by USL or posted as margin or other
	collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under




	its Oil
	Interests. Commodity pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to
	be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract’s (or other commodity
	interest’s) entire market value. While USCF has not and does not intend to leverage USL’s assets, it is not prohibited
	from doing so under the LP Agreement.






	Borrowings






	Borrowings
	are not used by USL unless USL is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if USL trades in cash commodities,
	or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.






	OTC Derivatives (Including
	Spreads and Straddles)






	In addition
	to Oil Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Oil Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges.
	These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market.
	Consequently, USL may purchase options on crude Oil Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.








	21










	 









	In addition
	to the Oil Futures Contracts and options on the Oil Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market
	in derivatives tied to crude oil. These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between
	two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded Oil Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the Oil
	Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party,

	i.e.

	, the risk that the other
	party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with
	such contracts, USL will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the
	International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) that provides for the netting of its overall exposure
	to its counterparty.

	assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant
	to guidelines approved by USCF’s Board.




	USL may
	enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (“Exchange for
	Related Position” or “EFRP” transactions). In the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by USL,
	the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of USL shares. These EFRP transactions may expose USL to counterparty
	risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract.
	Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP transaction will exist only on the day of execution.




	USL may
	employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the
	price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. USL would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions
	in futures written on the same underlying asset, but with different delivery months.




	During
	all of 2016 and through February 28, 2017, USL limited its derivatives activities to Oil Futures Contracts and EFRP transactions.
	USL did not engage in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange or forward contracts, including options on such
	contracts. USL does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed on a foreign exchange, forward contracts or
	options on such contracts, but it may do so as outlined in USL’s listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations.






	Pyramiding






	USL has
	not and will not employ the technique, commonly known as pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing
	positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest.

	Since the commencement of
	the offering of USL shares to the public on December 6, 2007 to February 28, 2017, the simple average daily change in the
	Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts was (0.016)%, while the simple average daily change in the per share NAV of USL over the
	same time period was (0.018)%. The average daily difference was (0.002)% (or (0.2) basis points, where 1 basis point equals 1/100
	of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts, the average error in daily tracking
	by the per share NAV was (0.729)%, meaning that over this time period USL’s tracking error was within the plus or minus
	10% range established as its benchmark tracking goal. 




	The table
	below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares and the daily NAV of USL, since inception through February
	28, 2017. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between USL’s closing market price and NAV, computed on
	a daily basis since inception, while the second and third rows depict the maximum daily amount of the end of day premiums and
	discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of day premiums and discounts
	typically occur because trading in the shares continues on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time while regular trading in
	the Benchmark Futures Contracts on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the relevant Benchmark Futures
	Contracts, for purposes of determining its end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	USCF and its Management
	and Traders





	USCF is
	a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on May 10, 2005. USCF maintains its main business
	office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612. USCF is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wainwright Holdings, Inc.,

	general partner and its affiliates) may elect its successor. USCF may not be removed as a general partner except upon approval
	by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding shares (excluding shares, if any, owned by
	USCF and its affiliates), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the LP Agreement.

	is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on USL’s website at

	www.uscfinvestments.com.

	The Board has
	determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Arca and the Audit Committee
	Charter. The Board has further determined that each of Messrs. Ellis and Fobes have accounting or related financial management
	expertise, as required by the NYSE Arca, such that each of them is considered an “Audit Committee Finance Expert”
	as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.

	USL’s
	Service Providers









	Custodian, Registrar, Transfer
	Agent and Administrator





	In its
	capacity as the Custodian for USL, BBH&Co holds USL’s Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents pursuant to a custodial

	for USL, BBH&Co. performs certain administrative and accounting services for USL and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports
	on behalf of USL.




	Currently,
	USCF pays BBH&Co. for its services, in the foregoing capacities, a minimum amount of $75,000 annually for its custody, fund
	accounting and fund administration services rendered to USL and each of the Related Public Funds, as well as a $20,000 annual

	$1 billion. The annual minimum amount will not apply if the asset-based charge for all accounts in the aggregate exceeds $75,000.
	USCF also pays transaction fees ranging from $7 to $15 per transaction.




	BBH&Co.’s
	principal business address is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110. BBH&Co., a private bank founded in 1818, is neither
	a publicly held company nor insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. BBH&Co. is authorized to conduct a commercial

	is also licensed to conduct a commercial banking business by the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and is subject
	to supervision and examination by the banking supervisors of those states.





	Marketing Agent





	USL also
	employs ALPS Distributors, Inc. (“ALPS Distributors”) as the Marketing Agent, which is further discussed under “What
	is the Plan of Distribution?” USCF pays the Marketing Agent an annual fee. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid
	to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with the offering of shares exceed

	ALPS Distributors’
	principal business address is 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. ALPS Distributors is a broker-dealer registered with
	the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.





	Futures Commission Merchant





	On October
	8, 2013, USCF entered into a Futures and Cleared Derivatives Transactions Customer Account Agreement with RBC Capital Markets,
	LLC (“RBC Capital” or “RBC”) to serve as USL’s FCM. This agreement requires RBC Capital to provide
	services to USL, as of October 10, 2013, in connection with the purchase and sale of Oil Interests that may be purchased or sold
	by or through RBC Capital for USL’s account. USL pays RBC Capital commissions for executing and clearing trades on behalf
	of USL.




	RBC Capital’s
	primary address is 500 West Madison Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, Illinois 60661. RBC Capital is registered in the United States
	with FINRA as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as an FCM. RBC Capital is a member of various U.S. futures and securities exchanges.




	RBC is
	a large broker-dealer subject to many different complex legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, certain of RBC’s
	regulators may from time to time conduct investigations, initiate enforcement proceedings and/or enter into settlements with RBC
	with respect to issues raised in various investigations. RBC complies fully with its regulators in all investigations being conducted
	and in all settlements it reaches. In addition, RBC is and has been subject to a variety of civil legal claims in various jurisdictions,
	a variety of settlement agreements and a variety of orders, awards and judgments made against it by courts and tribunals, both
	in regard to such claims and investigations. RBC complies fully with all settlements it reaches and all orders, awards and judgments
	made against it.




	RBC has
	been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation including those
	described below, arising in connection with its activities as a broker-dealer. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions
	include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. RBC is also
	involved, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies
	regarding RBC’s business, including among other matters, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result
	in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.








	28










	 











	RBC contests
	liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting
	the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations
	and proceedings are in the early stages, RBC cannot predict the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters; how or
	if such matters will be resolved; when they will ultimately be resolved; or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other
	relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, RBC believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel,
	that the outcome of such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of RBC.




	On June
	18, 2015, in connection with the SEC’s Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation (MCDC) initiative, the SEC commenced
	and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC Capital Markets, LLC for willful violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3)
	of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) after the firm self-reported instances in which it conducted
	inadequate due diligence in certain municipal securities offerings and as a result, failed to form a reasonable basis for believing
	the truthfulness of certain material representations in official statements issued in connection with those offerings. RBC Capital
	paid a fine of $500,000.




	RBC and
	certain affiliates were named as defendants in a lawsuit relating to their role in transactions involving investments made by
	a number of Wisconsin school districts in certain collateralized debt obligations. These transactions were also the subject of
	a regulatory investigation, which was resolved in 2011. RBC reached a final settlement with all parties in the civil litigation,
	and the civil action against RBC was dismissed with prejudice on December 6, 2016.




	Various
	regulators are conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of law by a number of banks and other entities, including RBC,
	regarding foreign exchange trading. Since 2015, RBC is a named defendant, along with many other entities, in pending putative
	class actions in the U.S. and Canada regarding foreign exchange trading. Based on the facts currently known, the ultimate resolution
	of these collective matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on RBC.




	On April
	13, 2015, RBC’s affiliate, Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas), was charged in France with
	complicity in tax fraud. RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French
	court. The trial of this matter has concluded and a verdict was delivered on January 12, 2017, acquitting the company and the
	other defendants.




	Thornburg
	Mortgage Inc. (now known as TMST) and RBC were parties to a master repurchase agreement executed in September 2003 whereby TMST
	financed its purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities. Upon TMST’s default during the financial crisis, RBC valued
	TMST’s collateral at allegedly deflated prices. After TMST’s bankruptcy filing, TMST’s trustee brought suit
	against RBC in 2011 for breach of contract. In 2015, TMST was awarded more than $45 million in damages. RBC has appealed. The
	appeals court set a briefing schedule and simultaneously ordered the parties to participate in a mediation. The parties have subsequently
	reached an agreement to settle the matter; a motion to approve the settlement was filed with the bankruptcy court on January 10,
	2016.




	On October
	14, 2014, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Court of Chancery) in a class action brought by former shareholders of Rural/Metro
	Corporation, held RBC Capital Markets, LLC liable for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty by three Rural/Metro directors,
	but did not make an additional award for attorney’s fees. A final judgment was entered on February 19, 2015 in the amount
	of US$93 million plus post judgment interest. RBC appealed the Court of Chancery’s determination of liability and quantum
	of damages, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed the ruling on additional attorneys’ fees. On November 30, 2015, the Delaware
	Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Chancery with respect to both the appeal and cross-appeal. RBC is cooperating with an investigation
	by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to this matter. In particular, the SEC contended that RBC caused materially
	false and misleading information to be included in the proxy statement that Rural filed to solicit shareholder approval for the
	sale in violation of section 14(A) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14A-9 thereunder. On August 31, 2016, RBC was ordered by the SEC
	to cease and desist and paid $500,000 in disgorgement, plus interest of $77,759 and a civil penalty of $2 million.




	On March
	11, 2013, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which
	alleged that RBC failed to follow its own procedures with respect to monthly account reviews and failed to maintain copies of
	the monthly account reviews with respect to certain accounts that James Hankins Jr. maintained at the firm in violation of N.J.S.A.
	49:3-58(a)(2)(xi) and 49:3-59(b). Without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law, RBC consented to a
	civil monetary penalty of $150,000 (of which $100,000 was suspended as a result of the firm’s cooperation) and to pay disgorgement
	of $300,000.

	On June
	12, 2012, the State of Illinois Secretary of State Securities Department consented to entry of a judgment enjoining the firm for
	violation of the Illinois Securities Law of 1953. RBC undertook to repurchase auction rate securities from certain customers before
	June 30, 2009. RBC also undertook to use best efforts to provide, by December 31, 2009, liquidity opportunities for customers
	ineligible for the buyback. RBC undertook to provide periodic reports to regulator. RBC paid a penalty of $1,400,139.82.




	On May
	10, 2012, FINRA commenced and settled an administrative proceeding against RBC for violations of FINRA Rules 1122 and 2010 and
	NASD Rules 2110 and 3010 for failing to establish, maintain and enforce written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to
	achieve compliance with applicable rules concerning short-term transactions in closed end funds. RBC paid a fine of $200,000.




	On May
	2, 2012, the Massachusetts Securities Division entered a consent order settling an administrative complaint against RBC, which
	alleged that RBC recommended unsuitable products to its brokerage and advisory clients and failed to supervise its registered
	representatives’ sales of inverse and leveraged ETFs in violation of Section 204(a)(2) of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities
	Act (“MUSA”). Without admitting or denying the allegations of fact, RBC consented to permanently cease and desist
	from violations of MUSA, pay restitution of $2.9 million to the investors who purchased the inverse and leveraged ETFs and pay
	a civil monetary penalty of $250,000.

	Breakeven
	Analysis





	The breakeven
	analysis below indicates the approximate dollar returns and percentage required for the redemption value of a hypothetical initial
	investment in a single share to equal the amount invested twelve months after the investment was made. For purposes of this breakeven
	analysis, an initial selling price of $19.73 per share which equals the NAV per share at the close of trading on February 28,
	2017, is assumed. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares to break even over the next 12 months, assuming a selling price
	of $19.73 the investment would have to generate 0.40% return or $0.077, rounded to $0.08.




	This
	breakeven analysis refers to the redemption of baskets by Authorized Participants and is not related to any gains an individual
	investor would have to achieve in order to break even. The breakeven analysis is an approximation only. As used in this table,
	(i) Professional Expenses include expenses for legal, audit, tax accounting and printing; and (ii) Independent Director and Officer
	Expenses include amounts paid to independent directors and for officers’ liability insurance.

	USL
	is contractually obligated to pay USCF a management fee based on daily net assets and
	paid monthly of 0.600% per annum on its average net assets.


	Average daily net assets are calculated daily by taking the average of the total
	net assets of USL over the calendar year,

	i.e.

	, the sum of daily total net assets
	divided by the number of calendar days in the year. On days when markets are closed,
	the total net assets are the total net assets from the last day when the market was open.
	See page 50 for a discussion of net assets of USL.










	(2)




	Authorized
	Participants are required to pay a Creation Basket fee of $350 for each order they place
	to create one or more baskets. This breakeven analysis assumes a hypothetical investment
	in a single share, which would equal the $350 Creation Basket fee divided by the total
	number of outstanding shares plus the 50,000 shares created by the Creation Basket, so
	the Creation Basket fee is ($0.002).










	(3)




	This
	amount is based on the actual brokerage fees for USL calculated on an annualized basis
	and includes an estimated half-turn commission of $2,200. A half-turn commission is the
	commissions liability related to FCM transaction fees for futures contracts on a half-turn
	basis.










	(4)




	USL
	earns interest on funds it deposits with the FCM and the Custodian and it estimates that
	the interest rate will be (0.314)% based on the current interest rate on three-month
	Treasuries as of December 31, 2016. The actual rate may vary.










	(5)




	USL
	pays fees to the SEC and FINRA to register its shares for sale. This amount is based
	on actual registration fees for USL calculated on an annualized basis. This fee may vary
	in the future.










	(6)




	The
	NYMEX Licensing Fee is 0.015% on aggregate net assets of the Related Public Funds, except
	BNO, USCI, USAG and CPER. For more information see “USL’s Fees and Expenses.”










	(7)




	Independent
	Director and Officer Expenses include amounts paid to independent directors and for officers’
	liability insurance. The foregoing assumes that the assets of USL are aggregated with
	those of the Related Public Funds, that the aggregate fees paid to the independent directors
	for 2016 was $582,050, that the allocable portion of the fees borne by USL equals $10,843,
	and that USL has $111,418,488 in average total net assets during the calendar year ended
	December 31, 2016.










	(8)




	Professional
	Expenses include expenses for legal, audit, tax accounting and printing. USL estimates
	the costs attributable to Professional Expenses for 2016 is $87,599. The number in the
	break-even table assumes USL has $111,418,488 in average total net during the calendar
	year ended December 31, 2016.

	Conflicts of Interest





	There
	are present and potential future conflicts of interest in USL’s structure and operation you should consider before you purchase
	shares. USCF will use this notice of conflicts as a defense against any claim or other proceeding made. If USCF is not able to
	resolve these conflicts of interest adequately, it may impact USL’s and the Related Public Funds’ ability to achieve
	their investment objectives.




	USL and
	USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to maintain USL’s asset size in order to preserve its fee income
	and this may not always be consistent with USL’s objective of having the value of its share’s NAV track changes in
	the average price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts.




	USCF’s
	officers, directors and employees, do not devote their time exclusively to USL. These persons are directors, officers or employees
	of other entities which may compete with USL for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to
	USL and to those other entities.




	USCF
	has adopted policies that prohibit their principals, officers, directors and employees from trading futures and related contracts
	in which either USL or any of the Related Public Funds invests. These policies are intended to prevent conflicts of interest occurring
	where USCF, or their principals, officers, directors or employees could give preferential treatment to their own accounts or trade
	their own accounts ahead of or against USL or any of the Related Public Funds.




	USCF
	has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of USL, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers
	its own interests which may create a conflict with your best interests. Limited partners have limited voting control, which will
	limit their ability to influence matters such as amendment of the LP Agreement, change in USL’s basic investment policy,
	dissolution of this fund, or the sale or distribution of USL’s assets.




	USCF
	serves as general partner or sponsor to each of USL and the Related Public Funds, UCCO and the REX Funds. USCF may have a conflict
	to the extent that its trading decisions for USL may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages.
	By way of example, if, as a result of reaching position limits imposed by the NYMEX, USL purchased gasoline futures contracts,
	this decision could impact USL’s ability to purchase additional gasoline futures contracts if the number of contracts held
	by funds managed by USCF reached the maximum allowed by the NYMEX. Similar situations could adversely affect the ability of any
	fund to track its benchmark futures contract.




	In addition,
	USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of the other funds, if the need for indemnification arises. This potential
	indemnification will cause USCF’s assets to decrease. If USCF’s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate
	for the indemnification, then USCF may terminate and you could lose your investment.




	Whenever
	a conflict of interest exists or arises between USCF on the one hand, and the partnership or any limited partner, on the other
	hand, any resolution or course of action by USCF in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved
	by all partners and shall not constitute a breach of the LP Agreement or of any other agreement or of any duty stated or implied
	by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by operation of the LP Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable
	to the partnership. If a dispute arises, under the LP Agreement it will be resolved either through negotiations with USCF or by
	courts located in the State of Delaware.




	Under
	the LP Agreement, any resolution is deemed to be fair and reasonable to the partnership if the resolution is:








	•




	approved
	by the audit committee, although no party is obligated to seek approval and USCF may
	adopt a resolution or course of action that has not received approval;










	•




	on
	terms no less favorable to the limited partners than those generally being provided to
	or available from unrelated third parties; or










	•




	fair
	to the limited partners, taking into account the totality of the relationships of the
	parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous
	to the limited partners.










	32










	 







	The previous
	risk factors and conflicts of interest are complete as of the date of this prospectus; however, additional risks and conflicts
	may occur which are not presently foreseen by USCF. You may not construe this prospectus as legal or tax advice. Before making
	an investment in this fund, you should read this entire prospectus (which can be found on USL’s website at

	www. uscfinvestments.com

	).
	You should also consult with your personal legal, tax, and other professional advisors.









	Interests of Named Experts
	and Counsel






	USCF
	has employed Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP to prepare this prospectus. Neither the law firm nor any other expert hired by USL
	to give advice on the preparation of this offering document has been hired on a contingent fee basis. Nor does any of them have
	any present or future expectation of interest in USCF, Marketing Agent, Authorized Participants, Custodian, Administrator or other
	service providers to USL.







	Ownership or Beneficial
	Interest in USL





	As of
	the date of this prospectus, no person owned more than five percent (5%) of the shares of USL. Also, as of the date of this prospectus,
	USCF and the principals of USCF do not own any of the shares of USL.







	USCF’s Responsibilities
	and Remedies





	Pursuant
	to the DRULPA, parties may contractually modify or even eliminate fiduciary duties in a limited partnership agreement to the limited
	partnership itself, or to another partner or person otherwise bound by the limited partnership agreement. Parties may not, however,
	eliminate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Where parties unambiguously provide for fiduciary duties in a limited
	partnership agreement, those expressed duties become the standard that courts will use to determine whether such duties were breached.
	For this reason, USL’s limited partnership agreement does not explicitly provide for any fiduciary duties so that common
	law fiduciary duty principles will apply to measure USCF’s conduct.




	A prospective
	investor should be aware that USCF has a responsibility to limited partners of USL to exercise good faith and fairness in all
	dealings. The fiduciary responsibility of a general partner to limited partners is a developing and changing area of the law and
	limited partners who have questions concerning the duties of USCF should consult with their counsel. In the event that a limited
	partner of USL believes that USCF has violated its fiduciary duty to the limited partners, he may seek legal relief individually
	or on behalf of USL under applicable laws, including under DRULPA and under commodities laws, to recover damages from or require
	an accounting by USCF. Limited partners may also have the right, subject to applicable procedural and jurisdictional requirements,
	to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder by the SEC. Limited partners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of the shares
	may be able to recover such losses from USCF where the losses result from a violation by USCF of the federal securities laws.
	State securities laws may also provide certain remedies to limited partners. Limited partners should be aware that performance
	by USCF of its fiduciary duty is measured by the terms of the LP Agreement as well as applicable law. Limited partners are afforded
	certain rights to institute reparations proceedings under the CEA for violations of the CEA or of any rule, regulation or order
	of the CFTC by USCF.







	Liability and Indemnification





	Under
	the LP Agreement, neither a general partner nor any employee or other agent of USL nor any officer, director, stockholder, partner,
	employee or agent of a general partner (a “Protected Person”) shall be liable to any partner or USL for any mistake
	of judgment or for any action or inaction taken, nor for any losses due to any mistake of judgment or to any action or inaction
	or to the negligence, dishonesty or bad faith of any officer, director, stockholder, partner, employee, agent of USL or any officer,
	director, stockholder, partner, employee or agent of such general partner, provided that such officer, director, stockholder,
	partner, employee, or agent of the partner or officer, director, stockholder, partner, employee or agent of such general partner
	was selected, engaged or retained by such general partner with reasonable care, except with respect to any matter as to which
	such general partner shall have been finally adjudicated in any action, suit or other proceeding not to have acted in good faith
	in the reasonable belief that such Protected Person’s action was in the best interests of USL and except that no Protected
	Person shall be relieved of any liability to which such Protected Person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,
	gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the Protected Person’s office.








	33










	 









	USL shall,
	to the fullest extent permitted by law, but only out of USL assets, indemnify and hold harmless a general partner and each officer,
	director, stockholder, partner, employee or agent thereof (including persons who serve at USL’s request as directors, officers
	or trustees of another organization in which USL has an interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise) and their respective
	Legal Representatives and successors (hereinafter referred to as a “Covered Person”) against all liabilities and expenses,
	including but not limited to amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties, and counsel fees
	reasonably incurred by any Covered Person in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit or other proceedings,
	whether civil or criminal, before any court or administrative or legislative body, in which such Covered Person may be or may
	have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which such person may be or may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter,
	by reason of an alleged act or omission as a general partner or director or officer thereof, or by reason of its being or having
	been such a general partner, director or officer, except with respect to any matter as to which such Covered Person shall have
	been finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief
	that such Covered Person’s action was in the best interest of USL, and except that no Covered Person shall be indemnified
	against any liability to USL or limited partners to which such Covered Person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
	misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Covered Person’s
	office. Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered Person, may be paid from time to time by USL in advance
	of the final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding on the condition that the amounts so paid shall be repaid to USL
	if it is ultimately determined that the indemnification of such expenses is not authorized hereunder.







	Meetings





	Meetings
	of limited partners may be called by USCF and may be called by it upon the written request of limited partners holding at least
	20% of the outstanding shares of USL. USCF shall deposit written notice to all limited partners of the meeting and the purpose
	of the meeting, which shall be held on a date not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
	at a reasonable time and place. USCF may also call a meeting upon not less than 20 and not more than 60 days prior notice.




	Each
	limited partner appoints USCF and each of its authorized officers as its attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in its
	name, place and stead to execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record all ballots, consents, approval waivers, certificates
	and other instruments necessary or appropriate, in the sole discretion of USCF, to make, evidence, give, confirm or ratify any
	vote, consent, approval, agreement or other action that is made or given by the partner of USL. However, when the LP Agreement
	establishes a percentage of the limited partners required to take any action, USCF may exercise such power of attorney made only
	after the necessary vote, consent or approval of the limited partners.







	Termination Events





	USL will
	dissolve at any time upon the happening of any of the following events:








	•




	The
	bankruptcy, dissolution, withdrawal, or removal of USCF, unless a majority in interest
	of the limited partners within 90 days after such event elects to continue USL and appoints
	a successor general partner; or










	•




	The
	affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners, provided that prior
	to or concurrently with such vote, there shall have been established procedures for the
	assumption of USL’s obligations arising under any agreement to which USL is a party
	and which is still in force immediately prior to such vote regarding termination, and
	there shall have been an irrevocable appointment of an agent who shall be empowered to
	give and receive notices, reports and payments under such agreements, and hold and exercise
	such other powers as are necessary to permit all other parties to such agreements to
	deal with such agent as if the agent were the sole owner of USL’s interest, which
	procedures are agreed to in writing by each of the other parties to such agreements.









	Provisions of Law





	According
	to applicable law, indemnification of USCF is payable only if USCF determined, in good faith, that the act, omission or conduct
	that gave rise to the claim for indemnification was in the best interest of USL and the act, omission or activity that was the
	basis for such loss, liability, damage, cost or expense was not the result of negligence or misconduct and such liability or loss
	was not the result of negligence or misconduct by USCF, and such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable
	only out of the assets of USL and not from the members, individually.






	Provisions of Federal
	and State Securities Laws






	This
	offering is made pursuant to federal and state securities laws. The SEC and state securities agencies take the position that indemnification
	of USCF that arises out of an alleged violation of such laws is prohibited unless certain conditions are met.








	34










	 









	Those
	conditions require that no indemnification of USCF or any underwriter for USL may be made in respect of any losses, liabilities
	or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws unless: (i) there has been a successful
	adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the party seeking indemnification and
	the court approves the indemnification; (ii) such claim has been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent
	jurisdiction as to the party seeking indemnification; or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the
	claims against the party seeking indemnification and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be
	made, provided that, before seeking such approval, USCF or other indemnitee must apprise the court of the position held by regulatory
	agencies against such indemnification. These agencies are the SEC and the securities administrator of the State or States in which
	the plaintiffs claim they were offered or sold membership interests.






	Provisions of the 1933
	Act and NASAA Guidelines






	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act may be permitted to USCF or its directors, officers, or persons
	controlling USL, USL has been informed that SEC and the various State administrators believe that such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (“NASAA”)
	commodity pool guidelines and is therefore unenforceable.







	Books and Records





	USL keeps
	its books of record and account at its office located at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612 or at the offices
	of the Administrator at its office located at 50 Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110, or such office, including of
	an administrative agent, as it may subsequently designate upon notice. These books and records are open to inspection by any person
	who establishes to USL’s satisfaction that such person is a limited partner upon reasonable advance notice at all reasonable
	times during the usual business hours of USL.




	USL keeps
	a copy of USL’s LP Agreement on file in its office which is available for inspection on reasonable advance notice at all
	reasonable times during its usual business hours by any limited partner.







	Statements, Filings, and
	Reports





	At the
	end of each fiscal year, USL will furnish to DTC Participants for distribution to each person who is a shareholder at the end
	of the fiscal year an annual report containing USL’s audited financial statements and other information about USL. USCF
	is responsible for the registration and qualification of the shares under the federal securities laws and federal commodities
	laws and any other securities and blue sky laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction as USCF may select. USCF is responsible
	for preparing all reports required by the SEC, NYSE Arca and the CFTC, but has entered into an agreement with the Administrator
	to prepare these reports as required by the SEC, CFTC and the NYSE Arca on USL’s behalf.




	The financial
	statements of USL will be audited, as required by law and as may be directed by USCF, by an independent registered public accounting
	firm designated from time to time by USCF. The accountants report will be furnished by USL to shareholders upon request. USL will
	make such elections, file such tax returns, and prepare, disseminate and file such tax reports, as it is advised by its counsel
	or accountants are from time to time required by any applicable statute, rule or regulation.






	Reports to Limited Partners






	In addition
	to periodic reports filed with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports
	on Form 8-K, all of which can be accessed on the SEC’s website at

	www.sec.gov

	or on USL’s website at

	www.uscfinvestments.com

	, USL, pursuant to the LP Agreement, will provide the following reports to limited partners in the manner
	prescribed below:





	Annual Reports.

	Within
	90 days after the end of each fiscal year, USCF shall cause to be delivered to each limited partner who was a limited partner
	at any time during the fiscal year, an annual report containing the following:








	(i)




	financial
	statements of the partnership, including, without limitation, a balance sheet as of the
	end of the partnership’s fiscal year and statements of income, partners’
	equity and changes in financial position, for such fiscal year, which shall be prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	consistently applied and shall be audited by a firm of independent certified public accountants
	registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,










	(ii)




	a
	general description of the activities of the partnership during the period covered by
	the report, and










	(iii)




	a
	report of any material transactions between the partnership and USCF or any of its affiliates,
	including fees or compensation paid by the partnership and the services performed by
	USCF or any such affiliate for such fees or compensation.










	35










	 








	Quarterly
	Reports.

	Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of each fiscal year, USCF shall cause to be delivered to each limited
	partner who was a limited partner at any time during the quarter then ended, a quarterly report containing a balance sheet and
	statement of income for the period covered by the report, each of which may be unaudited but shall be certified by USCF as fairly
	presenting the financial position and results of operations of the partnership during the period covered by the report. The report
	shall also contain a description of any material event regarding the business of the partnership during the period covered by
	the report.





	Monthly
	Reports.

	Within 30 days after the end of each month, USCF shall cause to be posted on its website and, upon request, to be
	delivered to each limited partner who was a limited partner at any time during the month then ended, a monthly report containing
	an account statement, which will include a statement of income (loss) and a statement of changes in NAV, for the prescribed period.
	In addition, the account statement will disclose any material business dealings between the partnership, USCF, commodity trading
	advisor (if any), FCM, or the principals thereof that previously have not been disclosed in this prospectus or any amendment thereto,
	other account statements or annual reports.




	USL will
	provide information to its shareholders to the extent required by applicable SEC, CFTC, and NYSE Arca requirements. An issuer,
	such as USL, of exchange-traded securities may not always readily know the identities of the investors who own those securities.
	USL will post the same information that would otherwise be provided in USL’s reports to limited partners described above
	including its monthly account statements, which will include, without limitation, USL’s NAV, on USL’s website

	www.
	uscfinvestments.com

	.







	Fiscal Year





	The fiscal year of
	USL is the calendar year. USCF may select an alternate fiscal year.







	Governing Law; Consent
	to Delaware Jurisdiction





	The rights
	of USCF, USL, DTC (as registered owner of USL’s global certificate for shares) and the shareholders, are governed by the
	laws of the State of Delaware. USCF, USL and DTC and, by accepting shares, each DTC Participant and each shareholder, consent
	to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and any federal courts located in Delaware. Such consent is not required

	U.S. Federal Income Tax
	Considerations





	The following
	discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares in
	USL, and the U.S. federal income tax treatment of USL, as of the date hereof. This discussion is applicable to a beneficial owner
	of shares who purchases shares in the offering to which this prospectus relates, including a beneficial owner who purchases shares
	from an Authorized Participant. Except where noted otherwise, it deals only with shares held as capital assets and does not deal
	with special situations, such as those of dealers in securities or currencies, financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance
	companies, persons holding shares as a part of a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging,” “conversion”
	or other integrated transaction for federal income tax purposes, traders in securities or commodities that elect to use a mark-to-market
	method of accounting, or holders of shares whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the discussion
	below is based upon the provisions of the Code, as amended, and regulations (“Treasury Regulations”), rulings and
	judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed, revoked or modified so as to result
	in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.








	36










	 











	Persons
	considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the United States
	federal income tax consequences in light of their particular situations as well as any consequences arising under the laws of
	any other taxing jurisdiction.




	As used
	herein, a “U.S. shareholder” of a share means a beneficial owner of a share that is a U.S. person. A “U.S. person,”
	for United States federal income tax purposes, is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or partnership
	created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate the income
	of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (X) that is subject to the
	supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons as described in section 7701(a)(30)
	of the Code or (Y) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States
	person. A “non-U.S. shareholder” is a holder that is not a U.S. shareholder and a “non-U.S. person” is
	an individual or entity that is not a U.S. person. If a partnership holds our shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally
	depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our
	shares, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences.




	USL has
	received the opinion of Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP, counsel to USL, that the material U.S. federal income tax consequences
	to USL and to U.S. shareholders and non-U.S. shareholders will be as described below. In rendering its opinion, Eversheds Sutherland
	(US) LLP has relied on the facts described in this prospectus as well as certain factual representations made by USL and USCF.
	The opinion of Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP is not binding on the IRS, and as a result, the IRS may not agree with the tax positions
	taken by USL. If challenged by the IRS, USL’s tax positions might not be sustained by the courts. No ruling has been requested
	from the IRS with respect to any matter affecting USL or prospective investors.




	EACH PROSPECTIVE
	INVESTOR IS ADVISED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO HOW U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN USL APPLY
	TO YOU AND AS TO HOW THE APPLICABLE STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXES APPLY TO YOU.






	Tax Status of USL






	USL is
	organized and operated as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the LP Agreement and applicable state law.
	Under the Code, an entity classified as a partnership that is deemed to be a “publicly traded partnership” is generally
	taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. The Code provides an exception to this general rule for a publicly traded
	partnership whose gross income for each taxable year of its existence consists of at least 90% “qualifying income”
	(“qualifying income exception”). For this purpose, section 7704 defines “qualifying income” as including,
	in pertinent part, interest (other than from a financial business), dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of capital
	assets held for the production of interest or dividends. In addition, in the case of a partnership a principal activity of which
	is the buying and selling of commodities (other than as inventory) or of futures, forwards and options with respect to commodities,
	“qualifying income” includes income and gains from such commodities and futures, forwards and options with respect
	to commodities. USL and USCF have represented the following to Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP:








	•




	At
	least 90% of USL’s gross income for each taxable year will be derived from (i)
	income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory) or futures, forwards, options,
	swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (ii) interest
	income;










	•




	USL
	is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable
	law;










	•




	USL
	has not elected, and will not elect, to be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes.






	Based
	in part on these representations, Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP is of the opinion that USL will be classified as a partnership
	for federal income tax purposes and that it is not taxable as a corporation for such purposes. USL’s taxation as a partnership
	rather than a corporation will require USCF to conduct USL’s business activities in such a manner that it satisfies the
	qualifying income exception on a continuing basis. No assurance can be given that USL’s operations for any given year will
	produce income that satisfies the requirements of the qualifying income exception. Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP will not review
	USL’s ongoing compliance with these requirements and will have no obligation to advise USL or USL’s shareholders in
	the event of any subsequent change in the facts, representations or applicable law relied upon in reaching its opinion.








	37










	 











	If USL
	failed to satisfy the qualifying income exception in any year, other than a failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent
	and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery, USL would be taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes
	and would pay federal income tax on its income at regular corporate rates. In that event, shareholders would not report their
	share of USL’s income or loss on their returns. In addition, distributions to shareholders would be treated as dividends
	to the extent of USL’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to holding period and other requirements, any
	such dividend would be a qualifying dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to long-term
	capital gains. To the extent a distribution exceeded USL’s earnings and profits, the distribution would be treated as a
	return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in its shares, and thereafter as gain from the sale of shares.
	Accordingly, if USL were to be taxable as a corporation, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the economic return
	from an investment in USL and on the value of the shares.




	The remainder
	of this summary assumes that USL is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that it is not taxable as
	a corporation.






	U.S. Shareholders







	Tax Consequences of Ownership
	of Shares






	Taxation
	of USL’s Income.

	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by USL on its income. Instead, USL files annual information returns,
	and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain,
	loss, deduction, and credit of USL. For example, shareholders must take into account their share of ordinary income realized by
	USL from accruals of interest on Treasuries and other investments, and their share of gain from Oil Interests. These items must
	be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from USL during
	the taxable year. Consequently, a shareholder may be allocated income or gain by USL but receive no cash distribution with which
	to pay its tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.
	Because USCF currently does not intend to make distributions, it is likely that in any year USL realizes net income and/or gain
	that a U.S. shareholder will be required to pay taxes on its allocable share of such income or gain from sources other than USL
	distributions. In addition, individuals with income in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing
	jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on their “net investment income,” which
	generally includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than certain
	amounts earned from trades or businesses). The income subject to the additional 3.8% tax includes any income from businesses involved
	in the trading of financial instruments or commodities.





	Allocations
	of USL’s Profit and Loss.

	Under Code section 704, the determination of a partner’s distributive share of any item
	of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is governed by the applicable organizational document unless the allocation provided
	by such document lacks “substantial economic effect.”




	An allocation
	that lacks substantial economic effect nonetheless will be respected if it is in accordance with the partners’ interests
	in the partnership, determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among
	the partners.




	In general,
	USL applies a monthly closing-of-the-books convention in determining allocations of economic profit or loss to shareholders. Income,
	gain, loss and deduction are determined on a monthly “mark-to-market” basis, taking into account our accrued income
	and deductions and realized and unrealized gains and losses for the month. These items are allocated among the holders of shares
	in proportion to the number of shares owned by them as of the close of business on the last business day of the prior month. Items
	of taxable income, deduction, gain, loss and credit recognized by USL for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year are
	allocated among holders in a manner that equitably reflects the allocation of economic profit or loss. USL has made the election
	permitted by section 754 of the Code, which election is irrevocable without the consent of the Service. The effect of this election
	is that, in connection with secondary market sales, we adjust the purchaser’s proportionate share of the tax basis of our
	assets to fair market value, as reflected in the price paid for the shares, as if the purchaser had directly acquired an interest
	in our assets. The section 754 election is intended to eliminate disparities between a partner’s basis in its partnership
	interest and its share of the tax bases of the partnership’s assets, so that the partner’s allocable share of taxable
	gain or loss on a disposition of an asset will correspond to its share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the
	asset since it acquired its interest. Depending on the price paid for shares and the tax bases of USL’s assets at the time
	of the purchase, the effect of the section 754 election on a purchaser of shares may be favorable or unfavorable.








	38










	 









	USL applies
	certain conventions in determining and allocating items for tax purposes in order to reduce the complexity and costs of administration.
	USCF believes that application of these conventions is consistent with the intent of the partnership provisions of the Code and
	the applicable Treasury Regulations, and that the resulting allocations will have substantial economic effect or otherwise are
	respected as being in accordance with shareholders’ interests in USL for federal income tax purposes. The Code and existing
	Treasury Regulations do not expressly permit adoption of these conventions although the monthly allocation convention described
	above is consistent with methods permitted under the applicable Treasury Regulations, as well as the legislative history for the
	provisions that requires allocations to appropriately reflect changes in ownership interest. It is possible that the IRS could
	successfully challenge this method and require a shareholder to report a greater or lesser share of items of income, gain, loss,
	deduction, or credit than if our method were respected. USCF is authorized to revise our allocation method to conform to any method
	permitted under future Treasury Regulations.




	The assumptions
	and conventions used in making tax allocations may cause a shareholder to be allocated more or less income or loss for federal
	income tax purposes than its proportionate share of the economic income or loss realized by USL during the period it held its
	shares. This “mismatch” between taxable and economic income or loss in some cases may be temporary, reversing itself
	in a later period when the shares are sold, but could be permanent.





	Mark
	to Market of Certain Exchange-Traded Contracts.

	For federal income tax purposes, USL generally is required to use a “mark-to-market”
	method of accounting under which unrealized gains and losses on instruments constituting “section 1256 contracts”
	are recognized currently. A section 1256 contract is defined as: (1) a futures contract that is traded on or subject to the rules
	of a national securities exchange which is registered with the SEC, a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market
	by the CFTC, or any other board of trade or exchange designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to which the
	amount required to be deposited and the amount that may be withdrawn depends on a system of “marking to market”; (2)
	a forward contract on exchange-traded foreign currencies, where the contracts are traded in the interbank market; (3) a non-equity
	option traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange; (4) a dealer equity option; or (5) a dealer securities
	futures contract.




	Under
	these rules, section 1256 contracts held by USL at the end of each taxable year, including for example Futures Contracts and options
	on Futures Contracts traded on a U.S. exchange or board of trade or certain foreign exchanges, are treated as if they were sold
	by USL for their fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. A shareholder’s distributive share of USL’s
	net gain or loss with respect to each section 1256 contract generally is treated as long-term capital gain or loss to the extent
	of 60 percent thereof, and as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 40 percent thereof, without regard to the actual
	holding period (“60 — 40 treatment”).




	Many
	of USL’s Futures Contracts and some of their other commodity interests will qualify as “section 1256 contracts”
	under the Code. Gain or loss recognized through disposition, termination or marking-to-market of USL’s section 1256 contracts
	will be subject to 60 — 40 treatment and allocated to shareholders in accordance with the monthly allocation convention.
	Cleared swaps and other commodity swaps will most likely not qualify as section 1256 contracts. If a commodity swap is not treated
	as a section 1256 contract, any gain or loss on the swap recognized at the time of disposition or termination will be long-term
	or short-term capital gain or loss depending on the holding period of the swap.





	Limitations
	on Deductibility of Losses and Certain Expenses.

	A number of different provisions of the Code may defer or disallow the deduction
	of losses or expenses allocated to you by USL, including but not limited to those described below.




	A shareholder’s
	deduction of its allocable share of any loss of USL is limited to the lesser of (1) the tax basis in its shares or (2) in the
	case of a shareholder that is an individual or a closely held corporation, the amount which the shareholder is considered to have
	“at risk” with respect to our activities. In general, the amount at risk will be your invested capital plus your share
	of any recourse debt of USL for which you are liable. Losses in excess of the lesser of tax basis or the amount at risk must be
	deferred until years in which USL generates additional taxable income against which to offset such carryover losses or until additional
	capital is placed at risk.




	Noncorporate
	taxpayers are permitted to deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains for the taxable year plus $3,000 of
	other income. Unused capital losses can be carried forward and used to offset capital gains in future years. In addition, a noncorporate
	taxpayer may elect to carry back net losses on section 1256 contracts to each of the three preceding years and use them to offset
	section 1256 contract gains in those years, subject to certain limitations. Corporate taxpayers generally may deduct capital losses
	only to the extent of capital gains, subject to special carryback and carryforward rules.




	Otherwise
	deductible expenses incurred by noncorporate taxpayers constituting “miscellaneous itemized deductions,” generally
	including investment-related expenses (other than interest and certain other specified expenses), are deductible only to the extent
	they exceed 2 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the year. Although the matter is not free from doubt,
	we believe management fees we pay to USCF and other expenses we incur will constitute investment-related expenses subject to the
	miscellaneous itemized deduction limitation, rather than expenses incurred in connection with a trade or business, and will report
	these expenses consistent with that interpretation. The Code imposes additional limitations on the amount of certain itemized
	deductions allowable to individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of certain amounts by reducing the otherwise allowable
	portion of such deductions by an amount equal to the lesser of:








	39










	 













	•




	3%
	of the individual’s adjusted gross income in excess of certain threshold amounts;
	or










	•




	80%
	of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year.






	Noncorporate
	shareholders generally may deduct “investment interest expense” only to the extent of their “net investment
	income.” Investment interest expense of a shareholder will generally include any interest accrued by USL and any interest
	paid or accrued on direct borrowings by a shareholder to purchase or carry its shares, such as interest with respect to a margin
	account. Net investment income generally includes gross income from property held for investment (including “portfolio income”
	under the passive loss rules but not, absent an election, long-term capital gains or certain qualifying dividend income) less
	deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income.




	To the
	extent that we allocate losses or expenses to you that must be deferred or disallowed as a result of these or other limitations
	in the Code, you may be taxed on income in excess of your economic income or distributions (if any) on your shares. As one example,
	you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income accrued by USL for a particular taxable year,
	and in the same year be allocated a share of a capital loss that you cannot deduct currently because you have insufficient capital
	gains against which to offset the loss. As another example, you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest
	income and capital gain for a year, but be unable to deduct some or all of your share of management fees and/or margin account
	interest incurred by you with respect to your shares. Shareholders are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors regarding
	the effect of limitations under the Code on your ability to deduct your allocable share of USL’s losses and expenses.





	Tax Basis of Shares





	A shareholder’s
	tax basis in its shares is important in determining (1) the amount of taxable gain or loss it will realize on the sale or other
	disposition of its shares, (2) the amount of non-taxable distributions that it may receive from USL and (3) its ability to utilize
	its distributive share of any losses of USL on its tax return. A shareholder’s initial tax basis of its shares will equal
	its cost for the shares plus its share of USL’s liabilities (if any) at the time of purchase. In general, a shareholder’s
	“share” of those liabilities will equal the sum of (i) the entire amount of any otherwise nonrecourse liability of
	USL as to which the shareholder or an affiliate is the creditor (a “partner nonrecourse liability”) and (ii) a

	pro
	rata

	share of any nonrecourse liabilities of USL that are not partner nonrecourse liabilities as to any shareholder.




	A shareholder’s
	tax basis in its shares generally will be (1) increased by (a) its allocable share of USL’s taxable income and gain and
	(b) any additional contributions by the shareholder to USL and (2) decreased (but not below zero) by (a) its allocable share of
	USL’s tax deductions and losses and (b) any distributions by USL to the shareholder. For this purpose, an increase in a
	shareholder’s share of USL’s liabilities will be treated as a contribution of cash by the shareholder to USL and a
	decrease in that share will be treated as a distribution of cash by USL to the shareholder. Pursuant to certain IRS rulings, a
	shareholder will be required to maintain a single, “unified” basis in all shares that it owns. As a result, when a
	shareholder that acquired its shares at different prices sells less than all of its shares, such shareholder will not be entitled
	to specify particular shares (

	e.g.

	, those with a higher basis) as having been sold. Rather, it must determine its gain
	or loss on the sale by using an “equitable apportionment” method to allocate a portion of its unified basis in its
	shares to the shares sold.





	Treatment
	of USL Distributions.

	If USL makes non-liquidating distributions to shareholders, such distributions generally will not be
	taxable to the shareholders for federal income tax purposes except to the extent that the sum of (i) the amount of cash and (ii)
	the fair market value of marketable securities distributed exceeds the shareholder’s adjusted basis of its interest in USL
	immediately before the distribution. Any cash distributions in excess of a shareholder’s tax basis generally will be treated
	as gain from the sale or exchange of shares.





	Constructive
	Termination of the Partnership

	. We will be considered to have been terminated for tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange
	of 50 percent or more of the total interests in our shares within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing
	of our taxable year for all shareholders. In the case of a shareholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending
	December 31, the closing of our taxable year may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being includable
	in its taxable income for the year of termination. We would be required to make new tax elections after a termination. A termination
	could result in tax penalties for the shareholders if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred. Moreover,
	a termination might either accelerate the application of, or subject us to, any tax legislation enacted before the termination.

	Tax Consequences of Disposition
	of Shares





	If a
	shareholder sells its shares, it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted
	tax basis for the shares sold. A shareholder’s amount realized will be the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other
	property received plus its share of any USL debt outstanding.




	Gain
	or loss recognized by a shareholder on the sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year will generally be taxable as
	long-term capital gain or loss; otherwise, such gain or loss will generally be taxable as short-term capital gain or loss. A special
	election is available under the Treasury Regulations that will allow shareholders to identify and use the actual holding periods
	for the shares sold for purposes of determining whether the gain or loss recognized on a sale of shares will give rise to long-term
	or short-term capital gain or loss. It is expected that most shareholders will be eligible to elect, and generally will elect,
	to identify and use the actual holding period for shares sold. If a shareholder fails to make the election or is not able to identify
	the holding periods of the shares sold, the shareholder may have a split holding period in the shares sold. Under such circumstances,
	a shareholder will be required to determine its holding period in the shares sold by first determining the portion of its entire
	interest in USL that would give rise to long-term capital gain or loss if its entire interest were sold and the portion that would
	give rise to short-term capital gain or loss if the entire interest were sold. The shareholder would then treat each share sold
	as giving rise to long-term capital gain or loss and short-term capital gain or loss in the same proportions as if it had sold
	its entire interest in USL.




	Under
	Section 751 of the Code, a portion of a shareholder’s gain or loss from the sale of shares (regardless of the holding period
	for such shares), will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to “unrealized
	receivables” or “inventory” owned by USL. The term “unrealized receivables” includes, among other
	things, market discount bonds and short-term debt instruments to the extent such items would give rise to ordinary income if sold
	by USL. However, the short term capital gain on section 1256 contracts resulting from 60 — 40 treatment, described above,
	should not be subject to this rule.




	If some
	or all of your shares are lent by your broker or other agent to a third party — for example, for use by the third party
	in covering a short sale — you may be considered as having made a taxable disposition of the loaned shares, in which case
	—








	•




	you
	may recognize taxable gain or loss to the same extent as if you had sold the shares for
	cash;










	•




	any
	of USL’s income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to those shares during the period
	of the loan will not be reportable by you for tax purposes; and










	•




	any
	distributions you receive with respect to the shares will be fully taxable, most likely
	as ordinary income.






	Shareholders
	desiring to avoid these and other possible consequences of a deemed disposition of their shares should consider modifying any
	applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit the lending of their shares.





	Other Tax Matters






	Information
	Reporting

	. We report tax information to the beneficial owners of shares. The IRS has ruled that assignees of partnership interests
	who have not been admitted to a partnership as partners but who have the capacity to exercise substantial dominion and control
	over the assigned partnership interests will be considered beneficial owners for federal income tax purposes. On the basis of
	such ruling, except as otherwise provided herein, we treat the following persons as partners for federal income tax purposes:
	(1) assignees of shares who are pending admission as limited partners, and (2) shareholders whose shares are held in street name
	or by another nominee and who have the right to direct the nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the
	ownership of their shares. USL will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), which
	will be used by the shareholders in completing their tax returns.




	Persons
	who hold an interest in USL as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us the following information: (1) the name,
	address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee; (2) whether the beneficial owner is (a) a
	person that is not a U.S. person, (b) a foreign government, an international organization or any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality
	of either of the foregoing, or (c) a tax-exempt entity; (3) the number and a description of shares acquired or transferred for
	the beneficial owner; and (4) certain information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers, means of acquisitions and
	transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as well as the amount of net proceeds from sales. Brokers and financial institutions
	are required to furnish additional information, including whether they are U.S. persons and certain information on shares they
	acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of $260 per failure, up to a maximum of $3,193,000 per calendar year,
	is imposed by the Code, as amended for failure to report such information correctly to us. If the failure to furnish such information
	correctly is determined to be willful, the per failure penalty increases to $530 or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of
	items required to be reported, and the $3,193,000 maximum does not apply. The nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner
	of the shares with the information furnished to us.

	Additional
	3.8% Tax on Net Investment Income

	. Individuals with income in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals
	filing jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on their “net investment income,”
	which generally includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than
	certain amounts earned from trades or businesses). The income subject to the additional 3.8% tax includes any income from businesses
	involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities.





	Partnership
	Audit Procedures

	. The IRS may audit the federal income tax returns filed by USL. Under current law, adjustments resulting
	from any such audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior year’s tax liability and could result in an audit of
	the shareholder’s own return. Any audit of a shareholder’s return could result in adjustments of non-partnership items
	as well as USL items. Partnerships are generally treated as separate entities for purposes of federal tax audits, judicial review
	of administrative adjustments by the IRS, and tax settlement proceedings. The tax treatment of partnership items of income, gain,
	loss and deduction are determined at the partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings
	with the shareholders. The Code provides for one shareholder to be designated as the “tax matters partner” and represent
	the partnership purposes of these proceedings. The LP Agreement appoints USCF as the tax matters partner of USL.




	In addition,
	for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, USL may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any “imputed understatement”
	of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed understatement generally includes increases
	in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit
	to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor
	or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If USL is required to pay any U.S. federal
	income taxes on any imputed understatement, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of USL and would likely have
	an adverse impact on the value of the shares. Under certain circumstances, USL may be eligible to make an election to cause the
	investors to take into account the amount of any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties. The ability of
	a publicly traded partnership such as USL to make this election is uncertain. If the election is made, USL would be required to
	provide investors who owned beneficial interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement
	setting forth their proportionate shares of the adjustment ( “Adjusted K-1s”). The investors would be required to
	take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K-1s are issued. The LP Agreement will appoint USCF
	as the partnership representative of USL.





	Tax
	Shelter Disclosure Rules

	. In certain circumstances the Code and Treasury Regulations require that the IRS be notified of taxable
	transactions through a disclosure statement attached to a taxpayer’s United States federal income tax return. These disclosure
	rules may apply to transactions irrespective of whether they are structured to achieve particular tax benefits. They could require
	disclosure by USL or shareholders if a shareholder incurs a loss in excess a specified threshold from a sale or redemption of
	its shares or possibly in other circumstances. While these rules generally do not require disclosure of a loss recognized on the
	disposition of an asset in which the taxpayer has a “qualifying basis” (generally a basis equal to the amount of cash
	paid by the taxpayer for such asset), they apply to a loss recognized with respect to interests in a pass-through entity, such
	as the shares, even if the taxpayer’s basis in such interests is equal to the amount of cash it paid. In addition, under
	recently enacted legislation, significant penalties may be imposed in connection with a failure to comply with these reporting
	requirements.

	Investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these reporting requirements to
	their specific situation.






	Tax-Exempt
	Organizations

	. Subject to numerous exceptions, qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, charitable organizations
	and certain other organizations that otherwise are exempt from federal income tax (collectively “exempt organizations”)
	nonetheless are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). Generally, UBTI means the gross
	income derived by an exempt organization from a trade or business that it regularly carries on, the conduct of which is not substantially
	related to the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose or function, less allowable deductions directly connected with that
	trade or business. If USL were to regularly carry on (directly or indirectly) a trade or business that is unrelated with respect
	to an exempt organization shareholder, then in computing its UBTI, the shareholder must include its share of (1) USL’s gross
	income from the unrelated trade or business, whether or not distributed, and (2) USL’s allowable deductions directly connected
	with that gross income.








	42










	 









	UBTI generally
	does not include dividends, interest, or payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale of property (other
	than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business). Nonetheless, income on, and gain from
	the disposition of, “debt-financed property” is UBTI. Debt-financed property generally is income-producing property
	(including securities), the use of which is not substantially related to the exempt organization’s tax-exempt purposes,
	and with respect to which there is “acquisition indebtedness” at any time during the taxable year (or, if the property
	was disposed of during the taxable year, the 12-month period ending with the disposition). Acquisition indebtedness includes debt
	incurred to acquire property, debt incurred before the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for
	the acquisition, and debt incurred subsequent to the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for
	the acquisition and at the time of acquisition the incurrence of debt was foreseeable. The portion of the income from debt-financed
	property attributable to acquisition indebtedness is equal to the ratio of the average outstanding principal amount of acquisition
	indebtedness over the average adjusted basis of the property for the year. USL currently does not anticipate that it will borrow
	money to acquire investments; however, USL cannot be certain that it will not borrow for such purpose in the future. In addition,
	an exempt organization shareholder that incurs acquisition indebtedness to purchase its shares in USL may have UBTI.




	The federal
	tax rate applicable to an exempt organization shareholder on its UBTI generally will be either the corporate or trust tax rate,
	depending upon the shareholder’s form of organization. USL may report to each such shareholder information as to the portion,
	if any, of the shareholder’s income and gains from USL for any year that will be treated as UBTI; the calculation of that
	amount is complex, and there can be no assurance that USL’s calculation of UBTI will be accepted by the Service. An exempt
	organization shareholder will be required to make payments of estimated federal income tax with respect to its UBTI.





	Regulated
	Investment Companies.

	Interests in and income from “qualified publicly traded partnerships” satisfying certain
	gross income tests are treated as qualifying assets and income, respectively, for purposes of determining eligibility for regulated
	investment company (“RIC”) status. A RIC may invest up to 25% of its assets in interests in a qualified publicly traded
	partnership. The determination of whether a publicly traded partnership such as USL is a qualified publicly traded partnership
	is made on an annual basis. USL expects to be a qualified publicly traded partnership in each of its taxable years. However, such
	qualification is not assured.






	Non-U.S. Shareholders






	Generally,
	non-U.S. persons who derive U.S. source income or gain from investing or engaging in a U.S. business are taxable on two categories
	of income. The first category consists of amounts that are fixed, determinable, annual and periodic income, such as interest,
	dividends and rent that are not connected with the operation of a U.S. trade or business (“FDAP”). The second category
	is income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (“ECI”). FDAP income (other than
	interest that is considered “portfolio interest”) is generally subject to a 30 percent withholding tax, which may
	be reduced for certain categories of income by a treaty between the U.S. and the recipient’s country of residence. In contrast,
	ECI is generally subject to U.S. tax on a net basis at graduated rates upon the filing of a U.S. tax return. Where a non-U.S.
	person has ECI as a result of an investment in a partnership, the ECI is subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 39.6 percent
	for individual shareholders and a rate of 35% for corporate shareholders.





	Withholding
	on Allocations and Distributions.

	The Code provides that a non-U.S. person who is a partner in a partnership that is engaged
	in a U.S. trade or business during a taxable year will also be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business during that
	year. Classifying an activity by a partnership as an investment or an operating business is a factual determination. Under certain
	safe harbors in the Code, an investment fund whose activities consist of trading in stocks, securities, or commodities for its
	own account generally will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business unless it is a dealer is such stocks, securities,
	or commodities. This safe harbor applies to investments in commodities only if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt
	in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place. Although the
	matter is not free from doubt, USL believes that the activities directly conducted by USL will not result in USL being engaged
	in a trade or business within in the United States. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assert
	that USL’s activities constitute a U.S. trade or business.




	In the event that USL’s
	activities were considered to constitute a U.S. trade or business, USL would be required to withhold at the highest rate specified
	in Code section 1 (currently 39.6%) on allocations of our income to individual non-U.S. Shareholders and the highest rate specified
	in Code section 11(b) (currently 35%) on allocations of our income to corporate non-U.S. Shareholders, when such income is allocated
	or distributed. A non-U.S. shareholder with ECI will generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return, and the return
	will provide the non-U.S. shareholder with the mechanism to seek a refund of any withholding in excess of such shareholder’s
	actual U.S. federal income tax liability. Any amount withheld by USL on behalf of a non-U.S. shareholder will be treated as a
	distribution to the non-U.S. shareholder to the extent possible. In some cases, USL may not be able to match the economic cost
	of satisfying its withholding obligations to a particular non-U.S. shareholder, which may result in such cost being borne by USL,
	generally, and accordingly, by all shareholders.




	If USL
	is not treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a non-U.S. shareholder may nevertheless be treated as having FDAP income,
	which would be subject to a 30 percent withholding tax (possibly subject to reduction by treaty), with respect to some or all
	of its distributions from USL or its allocable share of USL income. Amounts withheld on behalf of a non-U.S. shareholder will
	be treated as being distributed to such shareholder.








	43










	 











	To the
	extent any interest income allocated to a non-U.S. shareholder that otherwise constitutes FDAP is considered “portfolio
	interest,” neither the allocation of such interest income to the non-U.S. shareholder nor a subsequent distribution of such
	interest income to the non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to withholding, provided that the non-U.S. shareholder is not otherwise
	engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and provides USL with a timely and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN,
	W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form. In general, “portfolio interest” is interest paid on debt obligations issued in
	registered form, unless the “recipient” owns 10 percent or more of the voting power of the issuer.




	Most
	of USL’s interest income qualifies as “portfolio interest.” In order for USL to avoid withholding on any interest
	income allocable to non-U.S. shareholders that would qualify as “portfolio interest,” it will be necessary for all
	non-U.S. shareholders to provide USL with a timely and properly completed and executed Form W-8BEN (or other applicable form).
	If a non-U.S. shareholder fails to provide a properly completed Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form USCF may request
	that the non-U.S. shareholder provide, within 15 days after the request by USCF, a properly completed Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, or
	other applicable form. If a non-U.S. shareholder fails to comply with this request, the shares owned by such non-U.S. shareholder
	will be subject to redemption.





	Gain
	from Sale of Shares

	. Gain from the sale or exchange of the shares may be taxable to a non-U.S. shareholder if the non-U.S.
	shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year. In such
	case, the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30 percent withholding tax on the amount of such individual’s
	gain.





	Branch
	Profits Tax on Corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders.

	In addition to the taxes noted above, any non-U.S. shareholders that are corporations
	may also be subject to an additional tax, the branch profits tax, at a rate of 30 percent. The branch profits tax is imposed on
	a non-U.S. corporation’s dividend equivalent amount, which generally consists of the corporation’s after-tax earnings
	and profits that are effectively connected with the corporation’s U.S. trade or business but are not reinvested in a U.S.
	business. This tax may be reduced or eliminated by an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the
	non-U.S. shareholder is a “qualified resident.”





	Prospective
	non-U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisor with regard to these and other issues unique to non-U.S. shareholders.








	Backup Withholding





	USL may
	be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax (“backup withholding”) at a rate of 28% from all payments to: (1)
	any shareholder who fails to furnish USL with his, her or its correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that the
	shareholder is exempt from backup withholding, and (2) any shareholder with respect to whom the IRS notifies USL that the shareholder
	has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax and may be returned or credited against a taxpayer’s regular federal income tax liability
	if appropriate information is provided to the IRS.





	Foreign Account Tax Compliance
	Act Provisions





	Legislation
	commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” or “FATCA,” generally imposes a 30%
	withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) unless such FFIs
	(i) enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by U.S.
	persons (or held by foreign entities that have U.S. persons as substantial owners) or (ii) reside in a jurisdiction that has entered
	into an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) with the United States to collect and share such information and comply
	with the terms of such IGA and any enabling legislation or regulations. The types of income subject to the tax include U.S.-source
	interest and dividends, and after December 31, 2018, the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce U.S.-source
	interest or dividends. The information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each
	account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder’s account. In addition, subject to certain
	exceptions, this legislation also imposes a 30% withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not financial institutions
	unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than 10% U.S. owner or provides the withholding agent with
	identifying information on each greater than 10% U.S. owner. Depending on the status of a non-U.S. shareholder and the status
	of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares, Non-U.S. shareholders could be subject to this 30% withholding tax
	with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the sale of their shares. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S.
	shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.








	44










	 














	Other Tax Considerations





	In addition
	to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated business
	taxes, business franchise taxes, and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions
	in which USL does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those various taxes is not
	presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in USL. It is each shareholder’s
	responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax returns. Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP has
	not provided an opinion concerning any aspects of state, local or foreign tax or U.S. federal tax other than those U.S. federal
	income tax issues discussed herein.







	Investment by ERISA Accounts







	General






	Most employee
	benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
	of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) or the Code, or both. This section discusses certain considerations that arise under
	ERISA and the Code that a fiduciary of: (i) an employee benefit plan as defined in ERISA; (ii) a plan as defined in Section 4975
	of the Code; or (iii) any collective investment vehicle, business trust, investment partnership, pooled separate account or other
	entity the assets of which are treated as comprised (at least in part) of “plan assets” under the ERISA plan asset
	rules (“plan asset entity”); who has investment discretion should take into account before deciding to invest the
	plan’s assets in USL. Employee benefit plans, plans and plan asset entities are collectively referred to below as plans,
	and fiduciaries with investment discretion are referred to below as plan fiduciaries.




	This summary
	is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code as of the date hereof. This summary is not intended to be complete, but only
	to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code likely to be raised by your advisors. The summary does not include state
	or local law.





	Potential
	plan investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the appropriateness of an investment in USL
	and the manner in which shares should be purchased.







	Special Investment Considerations






	Each plan
	fiduciary must consider the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in USL, including the role that an investment
	in USL would play in the plan’s overall investment portfolio. Each plan fiduciary, before deciding to invest in USL, must
	be satisfied that the investment is prudent for the plan, that the investments of the plan are diversified so as to minimize the
	risk of large losses and that an investment in USL complies with the terms of the plan.






	USL and Plan Assets






	A regulation
	issued under ERISA contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an equity interest of a limited partnership
	will result in the underlying assets of the partnership being deemed plan assets for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
	Code. Those rules provide that assets of a limited partnership will not be plan assets of a plan that purchases an equity interest
	in the partnership if the equity interest purchased is a publicly-offered security. If the underlying assets of a partnership
	are considered to be assets of any plan for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the operations of that partnership
	would be subject to and, in some cases, limited by, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.




	The publicly-offered
	security exception described above applies if the equity interest is a security that is:








	1.




	freely
	transferable (determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances);










	2.




	part
	of a class of securities that is widely held (meaning that the class of securities is
	owned by 100 or more investors independent of the issuer and of each other); and










	3.




	either
	(a) part of a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange
	Act or (b) sold to the plan as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration
	statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and the class of which such security is a
	part is registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days (or such later time as may
	be allowed by the SEC) after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering
	of such security occurred.










	45










	 







	The plan
	asset regulations under ERISA state that the determination of whether a security is freely transferable is to be made based on
	all the relevant facts and circumstances. In the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment
	is $10,000 or less, the following requirements, alone or in combination, ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security
	is freely transferable: (1) a requirement that no transfer or assignment of the security or rights relating to the security be
	made that would violate any federal or state law, (2) a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without advance written
	notice given to the entity that issued the security, and (3) any restriction on the substitution of an assignee as a limited partner
	of a partnership, including a general partner consent requirement, provided that the economic benefits of ownership of the assignor
	may be transferred or assigned without regard to such restriction or consent (other than compliance with any of the foregoing
	restrictions).




	USCF
	believes that the conditions described above are satisfied with respect to the shares. USCF believes that the shares therefore
	constitute publicly-offered securities, and the underlying assets of USL are not considered to constitute plan assets of any plan
	that purchases shares.






	Prohibited Transactions






	ERISA
	and the Code generally prohibit certain transactions involving the plan and persons who have certain specified relationships to
	the plan.




	In general,
	shares may not be purchased with the assets of a plan if USCF, the clearing brokers, the trading advisors (if any), or any of
	their affiliates, agents or employees either:








	•




	exercise
	any discretionary authority or discretionary control with respect to management of the
	plan;










	•




	exercise
	any authority or control with respect to management or disposition of the assets of the
	plan;










	•




	render
	investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to
	any monies or other property of the plan;










	•




	have
	any authority or responsibility to render investment advice with respect to any monies
	or other property of the plan; or










	•




	have
	any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of
	the plan.






	Also,
	a prohibited transaction may occur under ERISA or the Code when circumstances indicate that (1) the investment in a share is made
	or retained for the purpose of avoiding application of the fiduciary standards of ERISA, (2) the investment in a share constitutes
	an arrangement under which USL is expected to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited if entered into directly
	by the plan purchasing the share, (3) the investing plan, by itself, has the authority or influence to cause USL to engage in
	such transactions, or (4) a person who is prohibited from transacting with the investing plan may, but only with the aid of certain
	of its affiliates and the investing plan, cause USL to engage in such transactions with such person.






	Special IRA Rules






	IRAs
	are not subject to ERISA’s fiduciary standards, but are subject to their own rules, including the prohibited transaction
	rules of Section 4975 of the Code, which generally mirror ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules. For example, IRAs are subject
	to special custody rules and must maintain a qualifying IRA custodial arrangement separate and distinct from USL and its custodial
	arrangement. Otherwise, if a separate qualifying custodial arrangement is not maintained, an investment in the shares will be
	treated as a distribution from the IRA. Second, IRAs are prohibited from investing in certain commingled investments, and USCF
	makes no representation regarding whether an investment in shares is an inappropriate commingled investment for an IRA. Third,
	in applying the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, in addition to the rules summarized above, the
	individual for whose benefit the IRA is maintained is also treated as the creator of the IRA. For example, if the owner or beneficiary
	of an IRA enters into any transaction, arrangement, or agreement involving the assets of his or her IRA to benefit the IRA owner
	or beneficiary (or his or her relatives or business affiliates) personally, or with the understanding that such benefit will occur,
	directly or indirectly, such transaction could give rise to a prohibited transaction that is not exempted by any available exemption.
	Moreover, in the case of an IRA, the consequences of a non-exempt prohibited transaction are that the IRA’s assets will
	be treated as if they were distributed, causing immediate taxation of the assets (including any early distribution penalty tax
	applicable under Section 72 of the Code), in addition to any other fines or penalties that may apply.






	Exempt Plans






	Certain
	employee benefit plans may be governmental plans or church plans. Governmental plans and church plans are generally not subject
	to ERISA, nor do the above-described prohibited transaction provisions described above apply to them. These plans are, however,
	subject to prohibitions against certain related-party transactions under Section 503 of the Code, which operate similar to the
	prohibited transaction rules described above. In addition, the fiduciary of any governmental or church plan must consider any
	applicable state or local laws and any restrictions and duties of common law imposed upon the plan.








	46










	 









	No view
	is expressed as to whether an investment in USL (and any continued investment in USL), or the operation and administration of
	USL, is appropriate or permissible for any governmental plan or church plan under Code Section 503, or under any state, county,
	local or other law relating to that type of plan.





	Allowing
	an investment in USL is not to be construed as a representation by USL, USCF, any trading advisor, any clearing broker, the Marketing
	Agent or legal counsel or other advisors to such parties or any other party that this investment meets some or all of the relevant
	legal requirements with respect to investments by any particular plan or that this investment is appropriate for any such particular
	plan. The person with investment discretion should consult with the plan’s attorney and financial advisors as to the propriety
	of an investment in USL in light of the circumstances of the particular plan, current tax law and ERISA.








	Form of Shares







	Registered
	Form.


	Shares are issued in registered form in accordance with the LP Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar
	and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all limited
	partners and holders of the shares in certificated form in the registry (the “Register”). USCF recognizes transfers
	of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the LP Agreement. The beneficial interests in such shares are held
	in book-entry form through participants and/or accountholders in DTC.






	Book
	Entry



	.

	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global
	certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
	The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC
	such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (“DTC Participants”), (2) those who maintain, either directly
	or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (“Indirect Participants”), and (3) those banks, brokers,
	dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants, in each
	case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through
	such participants’ accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to securities eligible for DTC’s Same-Day
	Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants’ securities accounts following confirmation of receipt
	of payment.






	DTC.


	DTC has advised us as follows. It is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York
	and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform
	Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
	DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants
	through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of DTC Participants.







	Transfer of Shares







	Transfers
	of Shares Only Through DTC.


	The shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Limited partners who
	are not DTC Participants may transfer their shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their shares (or by
	instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their shares are held) to transfer the shares. Transfers are
	made in accordance with standard securities industry practice.




	Transfers
	of interests in shares with DTC are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures of DTC and the nature of
	the transfer. DTC has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and/or accountholders of DTC. Because
	DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person or
	entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC,
	or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document
	representing such interest.




	DTC has
	advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a shareholder (including, without limitation, the presentation
	of a global certificate for exchange) only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants in whose account with DTC interests
	in global certificates are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate
	as to which such DTC Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.

	Transfer/Application
	Requirements



	.

	All purchasers of USL’s shares, and potentially any purchasers of shares in the future, who
	wish to become limited partners or other record holders and receive cash distributions, if any, or have certain other rights,
	must deliver an executed transfer application in which the purchaser or transferee must certify that, among other things, he,
	she or it agrees to be bound by USL’s LP Agreement and is eligible to purchase USL’s securities. Each purchaser of
	shares offered by this prospectus must execute a transfer application and certification. The obligation to provide the form of
	transfer application will be imposed on the seller of shares or, if a purchase of shares is made through an exchange, the form
	may be obtained directly through USL. Further, USCF may request each record holder to furnish certain information, including that
	record holder’s nationality, citizenship or other related status. A record holder is a shareholder that is, or has applied
	to be, a limited partner. An investor who is not a U.S. resident may not be eligible to become a record holder or one of USL’s
	limited partners if that investor’s ownership would subject USL to the risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of USL’s
	assets under any federal, state or local law or regulation. If the record holder fails to furnish the information or if USCF determines,
	on the basis of the information furnished by the holder in response to the request, that such holder is not qualified to become
	one of USL’s limited partners, USCF may be substituted as a holder for the record holder, who will then be treated as a
	non-citizen assignee, and USL will have the right to redeem those securities held by the record holder.




	A transferee’s
	broker, agent or nominee may complete, execute and deliver a transfer application and certification. USL may, at its discretion,
	treat the nominee holder of a share as the absolute owner. In that case, the beneficial holder’s rights are limited solely
	to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder.




	A person
	purchasing USL’s existing shares, who does not execute a transfer application and certify that the purchaser is eligible
	to purchase those securities acquires no rights in those securities other than the right to resell those securities. Whether or
	not a transfer application is received or the consent of USCF obtained, our shares are securities and are transferable according
	to the laws governing transfers of securities.




	Any transfer
	of shares will not be recorded by the transfer agent or recognized by USCF unless a completed transfer application is delivered
	to USCF or the Administrator. When acquiring shares, the transferee of such shares that completes a transfer application will:








	•




	be
	an assignee until admitted as a substituted limited partner upon the consent and sole
	discretion of USCF and the recording of the assignment on the books and records of the
	partnership;










	•




	automatically
	request admission as a substituted limited partner;










	•




	agree
	to be bound by the terms and conditions of, and execute, our LP Agreement;










	•




	represent
	that such transferee has the capacity and authority to enter into our LP Agreement;










	•




	grant
	powers of attorney to USCF and any liquidator of us; and










	•




	make
	the consents and waivers contained in our LP Agreement.






	An assignee
	will become a limited partner in respect of the transferred shares upon the consent of USCF and the recordation of the name of
	the assignee on our books and records. Such consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of USCF.




	If consent
	of USCF is withheld such transferee shall be an assignee. An assignee shall have an interest in the partnership equivalent to
	that of a limited partner with respect to allocations and distributions, including, without limitation, liquidating distributions,
	of the partnership. With respect to voting rights attributable to shares that are held by assignees, USCF shall be deemed to be
	the limited partner with respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such shares on any matter, vote
	such shares at the written direction of the assignee who is the record holder of such shares. If no such written direction is
	received, such shares will not be voted. An assignee shall have no other rights of a limited partner.




	Until
	a share has been transferred on our books, we and the transfer agent may treat the record holder of the share as the absolute
	owner for all purposes, except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations.








	48











	 














	What is the Plan of Distribution?







	Buying and Selling Shares






	Most
	investors buy and sell shares of USL in secondary market transactions through brokers. Shares trade on the NYSE Arca under the
	ticker symbol “USL.” Shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities.
	When buying or selling shares through a broker, most investors incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Investors are
	encouraged to review the terms of their brokerage account for details on applicable charges.






	Marketing Agent and
	Authorized Participants






	The offering
	of USL’s shares is a best efforts offering. USL continuously offers Creation Baskets consisting of 50,000 shares through
	the Marketing Agent, to Authorized Participants. Authorized Participants pay a $350 fee for each order they place to create or
	redeem one or more Creation Baskets. The Marketing Agent
	receives, for its services as marketing agent to USL, a marketing fee of 0.06% on USL’s assets up to the first $3 billion;
	and 0.04% on USL’s assets in excess of $3 billion; provided, however, that in no event may the aggregate compensation paid
	to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of the General Partner for distribution-related services in connection with this offering
	exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of this offering.




	The offering
	of baskets is being made in compliance with Conduct Rule 2310 of FINRA. Accordingly, Authorized Participants will not make any
	sales to any account over which they have discretionary authority without the prior written approval of a purchaser of shares.




	The per
	share price of shares offered in Creation Baskets on any subsequent day will be the total NAV of USL calculated shortly after
	the close of the core trading session on the NYSE Arca on that day divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares. An
	Authorized Participant is not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares.




	By executing
	an Authorized Participant Agreement, an Authorized Participant becomes part of the group of parties eligible to purchase baskets
	from, and put baskets for redemption to, USL. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and
	an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.




	As of
	February 28, 2017, USL had the following Authorized Participants: Citadel Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JP Morgan
	Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Company, Inc., Nomura Securities International
	Inc., RBC Capital Markets LLC, SG Americas Securities LLC, and Virtu Financial BD LLC.




	Because
	new shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of USL, a “distribution”, as
	such term is used in the 1933 Act, will be occurring. Authorized Participants, other broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned
	that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that would render them
	statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. For example, the
	Initial Authorized Participant was a statutory underwriter with respect to its initial purchase of Creation Baskets. In addition,
	any purchaser who purchases shares with a view towards distribution of such shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter.
	Authorized Participants will comply with the prospectus- delivery requirements in connection with the sale of shares to customers.
	For example, an Authorized Participant, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases
	a basket from USL, breaks the basket down into the constituent shares and sells the shares to its customers; or if it chooses
	to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand
	for the shares. Authorized Participants may also engage in secondary market transactions in shares that would not be deemed “underwriting”.
	For example, an Authorized Participant may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to shares that were previously
	distributed by other Authorized Participants. A determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must
	take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular
	case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to
	designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.




	Dealers
	who are neither Authorized Participants nor “underwriters” but are nonetheless participating in a distribution (as
	contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment”
	within the meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus-delivery exemption
	provided by Section 4(3) of the 1933 Act.




	USCF
	may qualify the shares in states selected by USCF and intends that sales be made through broker-dealers who are members of FINRA.
	Investors intending to create or redeem baskets through Authorized Participants in transactions not involving a broker-dealer
	registered in such investor’s state of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable broker-dealer
	or securities regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption.








	49










	 











	While
	the Authorized Participants may be indemnified by USCF, they will not be entitled to receive a discount or commission from USL
	for their purchases of Creation Baskets.







	Calculating Per Share NAV





	USL’s per share
	NAV is calculated by:








	•




	Taking
	the current market value of its total assets;










	•




	Subtracting
	any liabilities; and










	•




	Dividing
	that total by the total number of outstanding shares.






	The Administrator
	calculates the per share NAV of USL once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a normal trading day is released after
	4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time.
	The Administrator uses the NYMEX closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the NYMEX or 2:30 p.m. New York time)
	for the Oil Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX, but calculates or determines the value of all other USL investments (including
	Oil Futures Contracts not traded on the NYMEX, Other Oil-Related Investments and Treasuries), using market quotations, if available,
	or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE
	Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH&Co., USL and USCF.
	“Other information” customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the
	relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves,
	volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from
	internal sources if that information is of the same type used by USL in the regular course of its business for the valuation of
	similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a
	component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation,
	dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.




	In addition,
	in order to provide updated information relating to USL for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates
	and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund
	value is calculated by using the prior day’s closing per share NAV of USL as a base and updating that value throughout the
	trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active light, sweet Oil Futures Contracts on
	the NYMEX. The prices reported for those Oil Futures Contract months are adjusted based on the prior day’s spread differential
	between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract. In the event that the spot month contract is
	also the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, the last sale price for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is not adjusted. The indicative
	fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update
	of the per share NAV, because the per share NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant
	end of day values of USL’s investments.




	The indicative
	fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m.
	New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the NYMEX are 9:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York
	time. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which USL’s shares are traded
	on the NYSE Arca, but real-time NYMEX trading prices for Oil Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not available. During such
	gaps in time, the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Oil Futures Contracts from the
	NYMEX’s immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other Oil Futures Contracts, Other Oil-Related Investments and
	Treasuries held by USL will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors
	(such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.




	The NYSE
	Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund
	value is published on the NYSE Arca’s website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and
	Reuters.








	50










	 









	Dissemination
	of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors
	and market professionals in connection with the trading of USL shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are
	able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of USL and the indicative fund value. If the market price of USL shares
	diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades.
	For example, if USL appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy
	USL shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short Oil Futures Contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market
	price of USL and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.







	Creation and Redemption
	of Shares





	USL creates
	and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and redemption
	of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to USL or the distribution by USL of the amount of Treasuries and any cash represented
	by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of shares included in
	the baskets being created or redeemed determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets
	is properly received.




	Authorized
	Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered
	broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required
	to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an
	Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with USCF on behalf of USL (each such agreement,
	an “Authorized Participant Agreement”). The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation
	and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions. The
	Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by USCF, without the consent of any
	shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants pay a transaction fee of $350 to USL for each order they place
	to create one or more Creation Baskets or to redeem one or more Redemption Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased
	or otherwise changed by USCF. Authorized Participants who make deposits with USL in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions
	or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either USL or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or
	responsibility to USCF or USL to effect any sale or resale of shares.




	Certain
	Authorized Participants are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil
	futures market. In some cases, Authorized Participants or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell crude oil or Oil
	Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely
	that an Authorized Participant’s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will significantly affect the
	price of crude oil, Oil Interests or the price of the shares.




	Each
	Authorized Participant is required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is a member in good standing
	with FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and qualified
	to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized
	Participants may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own
	set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory
	regime.




	Under
	the Authorized Participant Agreement, USCF, and USL under limited circumstances, have agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants
	against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Participants
	may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.




	The following
	description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the
	relevant provisions of the LP Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail, each of which is incorporated
	by reference into this prospectus.






	Creation Procedures






	On any
	business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For purposes
	of processing purchase and redemption orders, a “business day” means any day other than a day when any of the NYSE
	Arca, the NYMEX or the New York Stock Exchange is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 12:00 p.m. New
	York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. The day on which the Marketing Agent receives
	a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.




	By placing
	a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash, as described
	below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Custodian
	the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Participants may not withdraw a creation request, except
	as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized Participant Agreement.








	51










	 









	The manner
	by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an
	Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian of the
	fund, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or
	exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with the fund for the
	purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date.
	If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified
	shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet USL’s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result
	of the Authorized Participant’s purchase of shares.






	Determination of Required
	Deposits






	The total
	deposit required to create each basket (“Creation Basket Deposit”) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is
	in the same proportion to the total assets of USL (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on
	the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of
	shares outstanding on the purchase order dates. USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator,
	the requirements for Treasuries and the amount of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury and proportions
	of Treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish such requirements at
	the beginning of each business day. The amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of
	the Treasuries required to be included in a Creation Basket Deposit as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the date the order to purchase
	is properly received and the total required deposit.






	Delivery of Required
	Deposits






	An Authorized
	Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to USL’s account with the Custodian the required
	amount of Treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit
	amount, the Administrator directs DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account
	on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of Treasuries until
	such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of USL shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant.




	Because
	orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 12:00 p.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during
	the continuous offering period will not be determined until after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is
	received, Authorized Participants will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit
	an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. USL’s NAV and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket
	could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase
	price in respect thereof is determined.






	Rejection of Purchase
	Orders






	USCF
	acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or
	a Creation Basket Deposit if:








	•




	it
	determines that the investment alternative available to USL at that time will not enable
	it to meet its investment objective;










	•




	it
	determines that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form;










	•




	it
	believes that the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax
	consequences to USL, the limited partners or its shareholders;










	•




	the
	acceptance or receipt of the Creation Basket Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel
	to USCF, be unlawful; or










	•




	circumstances
	outside the control of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian make it, for all practical
	purposes, not feasible to process creations of baskets.






	None
	of USCF, Marketing Agent or Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.








	52










	 













	Redemption Procedures






	The procedures
	by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business
	day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must
	be placed by 12:00 p.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order
	so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent (“Redemption Order
	Date”). The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder
	to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an Authorized Participant.




	By placing
	a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system
	to USL, as described below. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant
	must also have wired to USL’s account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.
	An Authorized Participant may not withdraw a redemption order, except as otherwise set forth in the procedures in the Authorized
	Participant Agreement.




	The manner
	by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement. By placing a redemption order,
	an Authorized Participant agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system to
	the fund’s account with the Custodian not later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the effective
	date of the redemption order (“Redemption Distribution Date”), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion,
	enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC energy transaction (through
	itself or a designated acceptable broker) with the fund for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing
	settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Participant fails to consummate (1) and (2)
	above, the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion,
	to meet USL’s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized Participant’s sale of shares.






	Determination of Redemption
	Distribution






	The redemption
	distribution from USL consists of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Participant of an amount of Treasuries and/or cash that
	is in the same proportion to the total assets of USL (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities)
	on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion
	to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator,
	determines the requirements for Treasuries and the amounts of cash, including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a Treasury,
	and the proportions of Treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish
	an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day.






	Delivery of Redemption
	Distribution






	The redemption
	distribution due from USL will be delivered to the Authorized Participant by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day
	following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such third business day, USL’s DTC account has been
	credited with the baskets to be redeemed. If USL’s DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed
	by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption
	distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if USL receives the
	fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining
	baskets to be redeemed are credited to USL’s DTC account by 3:00 p.m. New York time on such next business day. Any further
	outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized
	to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to USL’s DTC account
	by 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized
	its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTC’s book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.






	Suspension or Rejection
	of Redemption Orders






	USCF may,
	in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which
	the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on the NYSE Arca or the NYMEX
	is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation
	of Treasuries is not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection
	of the limited partners or shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow
	for the orderly liquidation of USL’s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating
	its positions,

	e.g.

	, because of a market disruption event in the futures markets, a suspension of trading by the exchange
	where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract,
	it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing
	Agent, the Administrator, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result
	from any such suspension or postponement.








	53










	 









	Redemption
	orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the
	Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. USCF may
	also reject a redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000
	shares (

	i.e.

	, two baskets) or less.






	Creation and Redemption
	Transaction Fee






	To compensate
	USL for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a
	transaction fee to USL of $350 per order to create or redeem baskets. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption
	of baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.






	Tax Responsibility






	Authorized
	Participants are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax
	or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is
	imposed directly on the Authorized Participant, and agree to indemnify USCF and USL if they are required by law to pay any such
	tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.






	Secondary Market Transactions






	As noted,
	USL creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation
	and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to USL or the distribution by USL of the amount of Treasuries
	and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which will be based on the aggregate NAV of the number
	of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly
	received.




	As discussed
	above, Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Participants
	must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that
	are not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation
	to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any baskets
	it does create. Authorized Participants that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-share
	offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca, the NAV of
	USL at the time the Authorized Participant purchased the Creation Baskets and the NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of
	the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the Oil Futures Contract
	market and the market for Other Oil-Related Investments. The prices of shares offered by Authorized Participants are expected
	to fall between USL’s NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale. Shares initially comprising
	the same basket but offered by Authorized Participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An
	order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. Authorized Participants
	who make deposits with USL in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of
	any kind from either USL or USCF, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to USCF or USL to effect any sale or
	resale of shares. Shares trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that
	are lower or higher relative to their NAV per share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the
	NAV per share may be influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the
	secondary market and the liquidity of the Oil Futures Contracts market and the market for Other Oil-Related Investments. While
	the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Oil
	Interests may be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads,
	and the resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.








	54











	 
















	Use of Proceeds





	USCF causes
	USL to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities. USCF
	will invest USL’s assets in Oil Interests and investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. When USL purchases
	an Oil Futures Contract and certain exchange-traded Other Oil-Related Investments, USL is required to deposit typically 5% to
	30% with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure
	payment for the obligation under Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions
	in OTC contracts will generally impose similar collateral requirements on USL. USCF will invest the assets that remain after margin
	and collateral are posted in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents Subject to these margin and collateral requirements. USCF
	has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are:








	•




	held
	on deposit with the FCM or other custodian,










	•




	used
	for other investments, and










	•




	held
	in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.






	Approximately
	5% to 30% of USL’s assets have normally been committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time to
	time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range. Ongoing margin and collateral
	payments will generally be required for both exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil Interests.
	Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected
	by overall market volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure
	under the Oil Interest, and each party’s creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under
	exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to
	estimate what portion of USL’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and
	cash equivalents held by USL will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements.
	All interest income will be used for USL’s benefit.




	An FCM,
	counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to USL to hold
	trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential
	for any positions held.




	The assets
	of USL posted as margin for Oil Futures Contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.




	If USL
	enters into a swap agreement, USL must post both collateral and independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount
	of collateral USL posts changes according to the amounts owed by USL to its counterparty on a given swap transaction, while independent
	amounts are fixed amounts posted by USL at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent amounts posted to swap
	counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.

	Item
	15.	Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	USL shall,
	to the fullest extent permitted by law, but only out of USL assets, indemnify and hold harmless a general partner and each officer,
	director, stockholder, partner, employee or agent thereof (including persons who serve at USL’s request as directors, officers
	or trustees of another organization in which USL has an interest as a Shareholder, creditor or otherwise) and their respective
	Legal Representatives and successors (hereinafter referred to as a “

	Covered Person

	”) against all liabilities
	and expenses, including but not limited to amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines and penalties,
	and counsel fees reasonably incurred by any Covered Person in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit or
	other proceedings, whether civil or criminal, before any court or administrative or legislative body, in which such Covered Person
	may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which such person may be or may have been threatened, while in
	office or thereafter, by reason of an alleged act or omission as a general partner or director or officer thereof, or by reason
	of its being or having been such a general partner, director or officer, except with respect to any matter as to which such Covered
	Person shall have been finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or other proceeding not to have acted in good faith in the
	reasonable believe that such Covered Person’s action was in the best interest of USL, and except that no Covered Person
	shall be indemnified against any liability to USL or limited partners to which such Covered Person would otherwise be subject
	by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such
	Covered Person’s office. Expenses, including counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered Person, may be paid from time
	to time by USL in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding on the condition that the amounts so
	paid shall be repaid to USL if it is ultimately determined that the indemnification of such expenses is not authorized hereunder.




	As to
	any matter disposed of by a compromise payment by any such Covered Person, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no such
	indemnification either for said payment or for any other expenses shall be provided unless such compromise shall be approved as
	in the best interests of USL, after notice that it involved such indemnification by any disinterested person or persons to whom
	the questions may be referred by United States Commodity Funds LLC (“USCF”), the general partner, provided that there
	has been obtained an opinion in writing of independent legal counsel to the effect that such Covered Person appears to have acted
	in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interests of USL and that such indemnification would
	not protect such persons against any liability to USL or its limited partners to which such person would otherwise by subject
	by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of office.




	Approval
	by any disinterested person or persons shall not prevent the recovery from persons as indemnification if such Covered Person is
	subsequently adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such
	Covered Person’s action was in the best interests of USL or to have been liable to USL or its limited partners by reason
	of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Covered
	Person’s office.







	II-

	1










	 







	The right
	of indemnification hereby provided shall not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any such Covered Person may be
	entitled. An “

	interested Covered Person

	” is one against whom the action, suit or other proceeding on the same
	or similar grounds is then or has been pending and a “

	disinterested person

	” is a person against whom none of
	such actions, suits or other proceedings or another action, suit or other proceeding on the same or similar grounds is then or
	has been pending. Nothing contained in this provision shall affect any rights to indemnification to which personnel of a general
	partner, other than directors and officers, and other persons may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law, nor the power
	of USL to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any such person.




	Nothing
	in this provision shall be construed to subject any Covered Person to any liability to which he is not already liable under this
	Agreement or applicable law.




	Each limited
	partner agrees that it will not hold any Affiliate or any officer, director, stockholder, partner, employee or agent of any Affiliate
	of USCF liable for any actions of USCF or any obligations arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
	contemplated hereby.

	Item
	17.	Undertakings





	(a) The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	(1)
	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:




	(i)
	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	(ii)
	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
	post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
	forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if
	the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high
	end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change
	in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective
	registration statement.




	(iii)
	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
	or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	Provided,
	however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the registration statement is on
	Form S–3 or Form F–3 and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs
	is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form
	of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.







	II-

	3










	 







	(2)
	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall
	be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at
	that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	(3)
	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold
	at the termination of the offering.




	(4)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:




	(i)
	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C (§230.430C of this chapter), each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part
	of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses
	filed in reliance on Rule 430A (§230.430A of this chapter), shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration
	statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement
	or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
	into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of
	contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus
	that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.




	(5)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
	distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned
	registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser,
	if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant
	will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	(i)
	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant
	to Rule 424 (§230.424 of this chapter);




	(ii)
	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
	to by the undersigned registrant;




	(iii)
	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
	registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	(iv)
	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	(b) The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and,
	where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial
	bona fide offering thereof.




	(c) Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
	persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,
	unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant
	of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
	suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered,
	the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court
	of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
	will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	(d) The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	(1)
	To send to the trustee at least on an annual basis a detailed statement of any transactions with the Sponsor or its affiliates,
	and of fees, commissions, compensation and other benefits paid, or accrued to the Sponsor or its affiliates for the fiscal year
	completed, showing the amount paid or accrued to each recipient and the services performed.




	(2)
	To provide to the trustee the financial statements required by Form 10-K for the first full fiscal year of operations of the partnership.

	Registration Statement on Form S-3




	No. 333-                                  






	 


	 




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	 


	We have acted as counsel
	to the United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (


	“USL”


	), and its general partner,
	the United States Commodity Funds LLC (the 


	“General Partner”


	), in connection with the registration
	statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC as of the date hereof (the 


	“Registration Statement”


	) filed
	by USL with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 


	“Act”


	),
	relating to 88,950,000 units representing limited partner interests in USL (the 


	“Units”


	), in connection
	with the offering described in the Registration Statement.


	As counsel to USL,
	we have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement and have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
	identified to our satisfaction by public officials or officers acting on behalf of USL as authentic copies of originals, of (i) USL’s
	certificate of limited partnership and its second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership dated as of March 1, 2013
	(the 


	“Partnership Agreement”


	), (ii) the General Partner’s sixth amended and restated limited
	liability company agreement dated as of May 15, 2015, (iii) a Certificate of Good Standing with respect to USL issued by the Delaware
	Secretary of State as of a recent date; (iv) resolutions of the board of directors of the General Partner acting on behalf
	of USL relating to the authorization, issuance, offer and sale of the Units pursuant to the Registration Statement, (v) a
	form of authorized purchaser agreement entered into by USL, the General Partner and each authorized purchaser filed as an exhibit
	to the Registration Statement (the 


	“AP Agreement”


	); and (vi) such other documents or matters
	of law as in our judgment were necessary to enable us to render the opinions expressed below.


	With respect to
	such examination and our opinion expressed herein, we have assumed, without any independent investigation or verification (i) the
	genuineness of all signatures (other than those of USL and the General Partner) on all documents submitted to us for examination,
	(ii) the legal capacity of all natural persons, (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals,
	(iv) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as conformed or reproduced copies and the authenticity
	of the originals of such copied documents, and (v) that all certificates issued by public officials have been properly issued.
	We also have assumed without independent investigation or verification the accuracy and completeness of all corporate records made
	available to us by USL and the General Partner.


	We have relied
	with your approval upon certificates of public officials, upon certificates and/or representations of officers and employees of
	the General Partner on behalf of USL, upon such other certificates as we deemed appropriate, and upon such other data as we have
	deemed to be appropriate under the circumstances. We have undertaken no independent investigation or verification of factual matters.


	The opinions expressed
	in this letter are limited to the Limited Liability Company Act and the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of
	Delaware (


	“RULPA”


	). We express no opinion with respect to any other laws of the State of Delaware or
	the laws of any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the preceding sentence, we express no opinion as to any state securities or
	broker-dealer laws or regulations thereunder relating to the offer, issuance and sale of the Units. This opinion letter has been
	prepared, and should be interpreted, in accordance with customary practice followed in the preparation of opinion letters by lawyers
	who regularly give, and such customary practice followed by lawyers who on behalf of their clients regularly advise opinion recipients
	regarding, opinion letters of this kind.








	 



	1



	 







	 




	Based upon and
	subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that (i) the issuance of the Units has been duly authorized and (ii) when
	the Units have been delivered to, and the agreed consideration has been fully paid at the time of such delivery by, the purchasers
	thereof, the Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and remains effective at the time of the offer and sale
	of the Units, and the Units are offered and sold as described in the Registration Statement, the Partnership Agreement and the
	AP Agreement, the Units will be validly issued and the holders, as limited partners of USL, will have no obligations to make further
	payments to USL or its creditors for their purchases of the Units or contributions to USL or its creditors solely by reason of
	their ownership of the Units or their status as limited partners of USL (subject to the obligation of a limited partner to repay
	any funds wrongfully distributed to it as and to the extent provided in RULPA).


	This opinion is
	limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond those expressly stated. Our
	opinions and other statements expressed herein are as of the date hereof, and we have no obligation to update this letter or to
	advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof.


	We hereby consent
	to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm in the “Legal
	Matters” section of the Registration Statement. We do not admit by giving this consent that we are in the category of persons
	whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.

	the preparation of the discussion set forth under the caption “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” (the “Discussion”)
	in the Registration Statement.


	 


	The Discussion, subject
	to the qualifications and assumptions stated in the Discussion and the limitations and qualifications set forth herein, constitutes
	our opinion as to the material United States federal income tax consequences for purchasers of the Shares pursuant to the Offering.


	 


	This opinion letter is
	limited to the matters set forth herein, and no opinions are intended to be implied or may be inferred beyond those expressly stated
	herein. Our opinion is rendered as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion or any matter
	related to this opinion to reflect any change of fact, circumstances, or law after the date hereof.


	 


	Furthermore, our opinion
	is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or a court. In addition, we must note that our opinion represents merely our best
	legal judgment on the matters presented and that others may disagree with our conclusion. There can be no assurance that the Internal
	Revenue Service will not take a contrary position or that a court would agree with our opinion if litigated.


	 


	We hereby consent to the
	filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the references to our firm and this opinion contained
	in the Discussion. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are “experts” under the Securities Act of 1933,
	as amended, or under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating thereto, with respect to any
	part of the Registration Statement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
