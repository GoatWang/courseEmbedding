Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

HealthLease Properties REIT Announces Acquisition from Mainstreet Property Group and Investment in New Development Fund, and Introduces New Trustee

Dec 09, 2013, 17:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   HealthLease Properties Real Estate Investment Trust 











 
















































 

 




















 



CARMEL, IN, Dec. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ - HealthLease Properties Real Estate
 Investment Trust (HLP.UN) ("HealthLease" or "the REIT") acquired a
 newly-built, triple-net leased, 100-unit seniors housing and care
 facility from Mainstreet Property Group, LLC ("Mainstreet"), the asset
 manager for the REIT. The facility is leased on a triple-net basis to
 an operator that is owned fifty percent (50%) by Life Care Services
 ("LCS"), a leading US provider of seniors housing and care, with
 retirement communities serving over 28,000 residents in 27 states, and
 fifty percent (50%) by an affiliate of Mainstreet.


The facility, Wellbrooke of Crawfordsville, is located in Montgomery
 County, Indiana, and marks the fourth Wellbrooke-branded facility in
 the state. As with the other properties, Crawfordsville is a Mainstreet
 Next Generation™ design that transforms seniors housing and care into a
 hospitality experience by incorporating hotel-like amenities and
 concierge-based services. Of the 100 units at Crawfordsville, 70 are
 licensed to provide skilled nursing, rehabilitation and therapy
 services, while the other 30 provide assisted living.


"As we continue to add Mainstreet-developed properties to our portfolio,
 we are building a strong brand presence as the leading owner of
 high-quality seniors' housing and care properties," stated Zeke Turner,
 Chairman and CEO of the REIT. "This market-leading position helps us
 attract great operators as tenants who recognize that HealthLease
 facilities will enable them to provide the best care for their
 consumers."


Crawfordsville was acquired under the REIT's pre-existing development
 agreement with Mainstreet, which provides the REIT with a right to
 acquire any seniors housing and care properties developed by
 Mainstreet. HealthLease acquired the property for its appraised value
 of $16,980,000 subject to post-closing adjustments.  Part of the
 consideration to Mainstreet is expected to be from the issuance 181,246
 Class B limited partnership units of MPG Healthcare LP, a subsidiary of
 the REIT, at a price of CDN$9.71 per unit, subject to the approval of
 the TSX.  The MPG Healthcare LP units are exchangeable into REIT units
 on a one-to-one basis.


Wellbrooke of Crawfordsville is the third Mainstreet-developed property
 to be acquired by the REIT post-IPO. Mainstreet has informed the REIT
 that it has a deep pipeline of development opportunities, including
 eight properties currently under development that will be offered to
 the REIT upon completion in 2014 with another twelve expected in 2015
 and beyond.


To continue to solidify its future acquisition opportunities,
 HealthLease today also announced that it has committed to an investment
 relationship with Mainstreet that will advance the development
 pipeline.


HealthLease has invested US$20 million in the development of between 12
 to 16 seniors' housing and care facilities in the United States over
 the next year. HealthLease's investment will consist of US$15 million
 of mezzanine financing, which is targeted to produce an annual return
 of 14% on funds invested by the REIT and US$5 million of equity
 financing, which is targeted to produce an annual return of 25% on
 funds invested by the REIT.  Mainstreet has committed US$5 million of
 equity financing to the developments.


"Our relationship with Mainstreet has enabled us to significantly grow
 the REIT in a relatively short period of time with high-quality assets
 that attract leading seniors' housing and care operators," said Zeke
 Turner, Chairman and CEO. "This investment by HealthLease will help us
 grow the pipeline of acquisitions, allow us to achieve scale and
 deliver long-term value to our unitholders. I am pleased with our
 team's innovative effort structuring an investment that provides access
 to the upside associated with internal development, while still
 generating current income to the REIT. The unique relationship between
 Mainstreet and HealthLease is creating significant value for
 unitholders."


Mainstreet Property Group LLC is a leading developer of seniors' housing
 and care facilities that has completed over $200 million of property
 development since 2002.  Their unique approach is to create Health Care
 Resorts™ that offer high-end, hotel-like design. The result is a
 hospitality-centered product incorporating concierge-based services to
 specifically cater to the evolving demands of the growing senior
 population.


Additionally, Marvin L. White was appointed to the Board of Trustees. 
 Marvin is currently the System Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
 of St. Vincent Health in Indiana.


About HealthLease Properties Real Estate Investment Trust

 one of the youngest and highest quality portfolios of seniors housing
 and care facilities with 45 properties - 12 in two Canadian provinces
 and 33 in eight U.S. states - for a total of 4,435 beds.  The
 facilities are leased to experienced tenant operators who have
 significant operational experience. The leases are structured as
 long-term and triple-net: features that provide stability and
 dependability to the REIT's cash flow and distributions.  The REIT's
 best-in-class portfolio meets the growing demands of modern seniors by
 emphasizing features such as hotel-like design, private rooms and baths
 and hospitality-inspired amenities.  For more information, visit www.hlpreit.com.

HealthLease Properties REIT Announces Acquisition from Mainstreet Property Group and Investment in New Development Fund, and Introduces New Trustee
			  



























































 
















/NOT FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES/


CARMEL, IN, Dec. 9, 2013 /CNW/ - HealthLease Properties Real Estate
 Investment Trust (HLP.UN) ("HealthLease" or "the REIT") acquired a
 newly-built, triple-net leased, 100-unit seniors housing and care
 facility from Mainstreet Property Group, LLC ("Mainstreet"), the asset
 manager for the REIT. The facility is leased on a triple-net basis to
 an operator that is owned fifty percent (50%) by Life Care Services
 ("LCS"), a leading US provider of seniors housing and care, with
 retirement communities serving over 28,000 residents in 27 states, and
 fifty percent (50%) by an affiliate of Mainstreet.


The facility, Wellbrooke of Crawfordsville, is located in Montgomery
 County, Indiana, and marks the fourth Wellbrooke-branded facility in
 the state. As with the other properties, Crawfordsville is a Mainstreet
 Next Generation™ design that transforms seniors housing and care into a
 hospitality experience by incorporating hotel-like amenities and
 concierge-based services. Of the 100 units at Crawfordsville, 70 are
 licensed to provide skilled nursing, rehabilitation and therapy
 services, while the other 30 provide assisted living.


"As we continue to add Mainstreet-developed properties to our portfolio,
 we are building a strong brand presence as the leading owner of
 high-quality seniors' housing and care properties," stated Zeke Turner,
 Chairman and CEO of the REIT. "This market-leading position helps us
 attract great operators as tenants who recognize that HealthLease
 facilities will enable them to provide the best care for their
 consumers."


Crawfordsville was acquired under the REIT's pre-existing development
 agreement with Mainstreet, which provides the REIT with a right to
 acquire any seniors housing and care properties developed by
 Mainstreet. HealthLease acquired the property for its appraised value
 of $16,980,000 subject to post-closing adjustments.  Part of the
 consideration to Mainstreet is expected to be from the issuance 181,246
 Class B limited partnership units of MPG Healthcare LP, a subsidiary of
 the REIT, at a price of CDN$9.71 per unit, subject to the approval of
 the TSX.  The MPG Healthcare LP units are exchangeable into REIT units
 on a one-to-one basis.


Wellbrooke of Crawfordsville is the third Mainstreet-developed property
 to be acquired by the REIT post-IPO. Mainstreet has informed the REIT
 that it has a deep pipeline of development opportunities, including
 eight properties currently under development that will be offered to
 the REIT upon completion in 2014 with another twelve expected in 2015
 and beyond.


To continue to solidify its future acquisition opportunities,
 HealthLease today also announced that it has committed to a
 co-investment relationship with Mainstreet and other investors that
 will advance the development pipeline.


HealthLease has invested US$20 million in Mainstreet Development Fund
 II, L.P. (the "fund"), which will be used to develop between 12 to 16
 seniors' housing and care facilities in the United States over the next
 year. HealthLease's investment will consist of US$15 million of
 mezzanine financing, which is targeted to produce an annual return of
 14% on funds invested by the REIT and US$5 million of equity financing,
 which is targeted to produce an annual return of 25% on funds invested
 by the REIT.  Mainstreet, the General Partner and Manager of the Fund,
 committed the initial US$5 million of equity financing to the fund. 
 The fund is expected to have additional closings from other third party
 investors in the first quarter of 2014.


"Our relationship with Mainstreet has enabled us to significantly grow
 the REIT in a relatively short period of time with high-quality assets
 that attract leading seniors' housing and care operators," said Zeke
 Turner, Chairman and CEO. "This fund will help us grow the pipeline of
 acquisitions, allow us to achieve scale and deliver long-term value to
 our unitholders. I am pleased with our team's innovative effort to
 create an investment vehicle that provides access to the upside
 associated with internal development, while still generating current
 income to the REIT. The unique relationship between Mainstreet and
 HealthLease is creating significant value for unitholders."


Mainstreet Property Group LLC is a leading developer of seniors' housing
 and care facilities that has completed over $200 million of property
 development since 2002.  Their unique approach is to create Health Care
 Resorts™ that offer high-end, hotel-like design. The result is a
 hospitality-centered product incorporating concierge-based services to
 specifically cater to the evolving demands of the growing senior
 population.


"With a rapidly growing population of Baby Boomers and a significantly
 aging infrastructure in the market today, there has been strong demand
 for facilities like ours from seniors' housing and care operators,"
 said Dennis Dechow, Vice President of Development for Mainstreet. "This
 fund will help us to accelerate our development pipeline to meet the
 ever growing need for quality seniors' care properties in the United
 States."


Additionally, Marvin L. White was appointed to the Board of Trustees. 
 Marvin is currently the System Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
 of St. Vincent Health in Indiana.

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.
