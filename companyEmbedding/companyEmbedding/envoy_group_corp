(1) The SEC Reporting line item includes the cost of complying with the SEC’s 
    disclosure requirements.

Even if we are able to sell all of the securities being offered in this 
Prospectus, we will require an additional $575,000 to cover our anticipated 
expenses over the next 18 months. Please note that there can be no assurance 
that we will be able to raise such funds. 

If we are only able to sell less than 35% of the securities we are offering,
substantially all of the funds raised by this offering will be spent on assuring
that we meet our corporate and disclosure obligations so that we remain in good
standing with the State of Florida and maintain our status as a reporting issuer
with the SEC.

Importantly, our business plan and allocation of proceeds may vary according to
the amount proceeds raised by the sale of securities hereunder and through our
future financing efforts. The figures included in the above table show a
increase in funds allocated to each category of expenses under our business plan
in proportion to the percentage of shares sold (whether 35%, 50%, 75%, or 100%).
However, we estimate that we will require as much as $575,000 in addition to the
$ $37,500 that we are seeking to raise through this prospectus in order to
establish operations of a sufficient size and quality to ensure the
competitiveness of our business and to generate significant revenues.
Nevertheless, if our potential to raise capital appears exhausted, our
management may decide to modify our business plan on a reduced scale and
quality. This might entail the use of used equipment, a used or leased vehicle
for transportation, less marketing, smaller facility, part-time personnel,
reduction in consultants and G&A expenses.  A decision by our management to
implement our business plan on a reduced scale and quality may occur at any
juncture during the early stage of our business development, whether we have
raised 35%, 50% 75% or 100% of the proceeds that we will seeking to raise
through this offering or any percentage of the additional $37,500 that we are
seeking to raise. In the opinion of our management, the consequences of
implementing our business plan on a reduced quality and scale will be a
reduction in our capacity to provide services and generate revenue, a critical
decrease or deficiency in our working capital, and an increased likelihood that
our business will fail. Moreover, even if our financing potential becomes
exhausted before we are able to raise the funds that we are seeking to raise,
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing a scaled down
version of our business plan, especially if we have not raised any of our
disclosed funds to be raised hereunder. Other than the preparation of this
prospectus, we have not taken any steps to identify financing sources for any
portion of the funds that we anticipate we will need to execute our business
plan. There is no guarantee that any financing will be available to us.


We believe that the principal methods of competition in the company’s intended
market are the traditional local and regional adult day care companies. Sarah
Adult Day Services Inc. Canton, OH 44704 appears to be the largest in the USA
and operates in 18 states. However, we believe that very few companies are
focusing on this need. We believe that ENVOY GROUP CORP. intents to enter into
this market place to address problems with solutions. The National traditional
companies have the finances and resources to become major players in this market
if they elect to do so. We believe that there is a huge growing need for new
types of companies to enter into this market to provide adult day care services.
However we believe, ENVOY GROUP CORP. Adult Day Care Center services may provide
success in this market segment.

The following table estimates our costs to open the Adult Day Care Center:

Company Description
We intend to open a Pilot Adult Day Care Center, in the Sarasota County, Florida
area. We intend to develop our business to cater to seniors who can no longer
manage independently, or who are isolated and lonely. We believe with life
expectancy rising, more and more seniors will require assistance


 as they age. We
intend to provide seniors with a non-residential facility that supports the
health, nutritional, social support and daily living needs in a professionally
staffed group setting enabling them to enjoy their day while receiving the care
and support they need.  We plan to have our services to be supervised by
registered and/or licensed personnel. We intend the daily activity for our
seniors will be tailored to their needs by providing them with supervised
activity such as, salon and spa services, current events, speakers, dancing,
computer education, arts and crafts, exercising, and many more. We intend to
provide meals tailored to the individual senior needs, and transportation if
required.  After the intended development and implementation of our Pilot
center, we intend to replicate this via franchising.

We intend to market our services by advertising in print and electronic media,
website, local networking, and by direct sales calls to doctors, nurses,
hospitals, religious institutions in our local area. We intend to exhibit at
local relevant fairs and shows. We have taken no steps to market our services,
to exhibit our services, or to establish a website and there is no guarantee
that we will ever be able to do so.

To date we have not commenced providing any services, have not created
relationships with any potential personnel, potential customers, consultants,
real estate location, or achieved any other goals mentioned in this prospectus
toward the achievement of our business plan. Importantly, there is no guarantee
that we will succeed in accomplishing any of these goals. In order to accomplish
these goals we will require the disclosed financing.

---

We are a development-stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on 
April 8, 2013, as a for-profit company. Our business and registered office is 
located at 3811 Alden Way, Sarasota, FL 34232. Our telephone number is 
941-650-3848.

Digital Currency  A Global Phenomenon
Blockchains were first developed for digital currencies. There are now 700 Bitcoin-like digital currencies that have emerged in the last 8 years. Such currency has properties similar to physical currencies, but allow for instantaneous transfers and borderless ownership. The top digital currencies are collectively now worth over $38 Billion.


“Bitcoin exhibits characteristics of a unique asset class — meeting the bar of investability, and differing substantially from other assets in terms of its politico-economic profile, price independence, and risk-reward characteristics,” the analysts wrote. -- Tech Central

"The media thoroughly covered its meteoric rise in market value as a currency, but the bigger story is that high-profile investors have placed significant bets on Bitcoin-related businesses this year, including Li-Ka Shing, Union Square Ventures, and Andreessen-Horowitz," Danco wrote.

What is Bitcoin Blockchain?

Published on Jun 6, 2017 on YouTube
What is Bitcoin Blockchain? Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.

The OpportunityConsider how even todays ‘paper’ currencies are actually acting more and more like digital currencies. We may get paid directly into our account, pay for goods and services with a credit or debit card, or pay online for utilities or transfer funds without ever touching the paper the currency represents.
Digital currencies are slowly introduced at a set rate and have fluctuating valuations much like the U.S. Dollar does against the Euro or Yen. Collection, or ‘mining’ of these currencies is accomplished by employing computers running specialized software. Mining operations can be instantly directed to focus on the currencies that offer optimal value for time and energy expenditure.
The PlanUnder our strategic plan, innovative opportunities and technology applications and platforms are being developed by the Company for exciting and strategic ventures. BitReturn is planning a multifaceted strategy that will effectively utilize Block Chain Technology for secure database, network and currency applications.

BitReturn has first targeted a high positive cash flow method of Mining of Digital Currencies that has been de-risked by employing the most effective Graphic Processor (GPU) technology and BitReturn’s secure Tier3 (T3) facility in Kamloops, B.C.
Secondary and Tertiary uses of Blockchain technology will be implemented in Phase 2. Applications currently under development include B2B Solutions for the Real Estate, Telecom, and Banking sector. Each application that has been mapped out is tied directly to high value revenue generation.
The PeopleAt BitReturn, we have over 20 solid years of technology infrastructure development , innovation and implementation. The BitReturn team was behind the development of Bignition which was later bought by Autotrader to provide the highest level used and new car online buying experience. 
BitReturn’s management has over 5 years digital currency mining experience and is set to utilize the state of the art, 10,000 sq. foot facility that will provide the perfect blend of security, power stability, internet bandwidth and environmental control for a massive network of ‘miners’ that will be set to produce the solid backbone of the company; continuous daily positive cash flow.
