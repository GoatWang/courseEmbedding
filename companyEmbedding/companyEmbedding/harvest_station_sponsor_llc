With the end of 2016 comes a milestone - over 6500 online IOT devices online.
In November a magnitutde 7.8 earthquake struck just out of Kaikoura. One of of the results of the earthquake was signficant
slips at Hapuku and Goose Bay causing earth dams to form in the streams. These two slips pose signifcant risk to the bridges on SH1
and in the case of Goose Bay, the settlement and camp ground. Harvest were contracted by NZTA and Kaikoura District Council to install
monitoring equipment at both dams and to provide alerts on the Hapuku and Goose Bay bridges to warn motorists in case of dam burst as
significant damage could be caused. In the case of Goose Bay another alert was setup to warn the residents of dam burst so they would
have sufficient time to reach high ground.

Gasoline Retailers Fill Up On Sponsorship


Although the corporations they work for may be earning record profits, that does not necessarily mean good times for the retail gasoline marketers at the U.S.’s major oil refiners. Charged with putting a good public face on an industry consumers love to hate while also giving them reasons to choose a gas station other than the lowest pump price, gasoline marketers have signed a wide variety of sponsorship deals ranging from community festivals to national properties.Those deals have a number of objectives, most typically driving traffic, touting new convenience options, aligning with environmental concerns and entertaining fuel distributors–known in the industry as “jobbers”–as well as the independent owners who operate the majority of the country’s stations.Sponsorship activity by seven of the largest gasoline marketers is detailed beginning on page four. In addition, the other top 10 refiners, according to National Petroleum News, should be on properties’ radar screens in the areas where they have stations and offices: San Antonio-based Valero Energy Corp., Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum Co. and New York City-based Amerada Hess Corp.Gasoline Retailers: Who Does WhatCompanyBP America, Inc.28100 Torch Pkwy.Warrenville, IL 60555Targets/Objectives/Key ActivationsBP has more than 14,200 gas stations in the U.S. Of those, about 3,500 are company owned and 10,700 are independently owned. The total includes 1,500 ARCO am/pm convenience-store stations in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington. BP focuses its sponsorship efforts on markets where it has a large number of employees: Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City and Anchorage, Alaska. The company leverages ties to engage employees; for example nearly 1,000 workers are involved with the BP MS 150 Bike Tour in Texas.
