Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Digital Equipment Corporation
From 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.
Initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the PDP-8, widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the PDP-11 in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.
Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.
The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[1][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[2] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.
Products[edit]
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.[3]
Research[edit]
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were operated by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Systems Research Center (SRC) in Palo Alto, California, US
Network Systems Laboratory (NSL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US
Paris Research Laboratory (PRL) in Paris, France
MetroWest Technology Campus (MTC) in Maynard, Massachusetts, US

Some of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&D in general include:

Gordon Bell: technical visionary, VP Engineering 1972–83; Microsoft Research
Leonard Bosack
Henry Burkhardt III: co-founder of Data General Corporation and Kendall Square Research
Mike Burrows
Luca Cardelli
Dave Cutler: led RSX-11M and VAX/VMS operating systems development; then led Windows NT development at Microsoft[discuss]
Ed deCastro: co-founder of Data General Corporation
Alan Eustace
Jim Gettys: early developer of X Window System[discuss]
Henri Gouraud
Jim Gray
Alan Kotok
Leslie Lamport
Butler Lampson
Louis Monier
Isaac Nassi
Radia Perlman
Marcus Ranum
Brian Reid
Paul Vixie

Some of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp who were responsible for developing Alpha and StrongARM:

Daniel W. Dobberpuhl
Jim Keller
Rich Witek

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the Digital Technical Journal,[4] which was in published from 1985 until 1998.[5]

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Digital Equipment Corporation
From 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.
Initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the PDP-8, widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the PDP-11 in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.
Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.
The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[1][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[2] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.
Products[edit]
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.[3]
Research[edit]
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were operated by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Systems Research Center (SRC) in Palo Alto, California, US
Network Systems Laboratory (NSL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US
Paris Research Laboratory (PRL) in Paris, France
MetroWest Technology Campus (MTC) in Maynard, Massachusetts, US

Some of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&D in general include:

Gordon Bell: technical visionary, VP Engineering 1972–83; Microsoft Research
Leonard Bosack
Henry Burkhardt III: co-founder of Data General Corporation and Kendall Square Research
Mike Burrows
Luca Cardelli
Dave Cutler: led RSX-11M and VAX/VMS operating systems development; then led Windows NT development at Microsoft[discuss]
Ed deCastro: co-founder of Data General Corporation
Alan Eustace
Jim Gettys: early developer of X Window System[discuss]
Henri Gouraud
Jim Gray
Alan Kotok
Leslie Lamport
Butler Lampson
Louis Monier
Isaac Nassi
Radia Perlman
Marcus Ranum
Brian Reid
Paul Vixie

Some of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp who were responsible for developing Alpha and StrongARM:

Daniel W. Dobberpuhl
Jim Keller
Rich Witek

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the Digital Technical Journal,[4] which was in published from 1985 until 1998.[5]

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]
Key people[edit]

Woody Norris, Founder
Alfred H. Falk, President/CEO: Falk was promoted and re-appointed President and CEO of the company on January 20, 2009. He formerly served as President and a member of the Board from January 1997 (and from July 1998 as CEO) until July 2004 when he resigned to again become e.Digital's Vice President (VP) of Corporate Development.[citation needed]
Allen Cocumelli, Chairman of the Board: Cocumelli has served on e.Digital's Board of Directors since 1999. He was re-appointed Chairman in October 2008 upon the resignation of Chairman Alex Diaz, having previously served as Chairman from April 2000 to November 2002.[citation needed]

Notoriety[edit]
e.Digital is perhaps best known for a phenomenal rise in the price of its stock during the dot-com bubble from a low of $0.06 in January 1999 to an intra-day peak of $24.50 on January 24, 2000, fuelled primarily by speculation on multiple internet message boards, most prominently the RagingBull.com forum[47] that the stock would become listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[48][49][50] The share price quickly receded and NASDAQ eventually denied the listing.[51] The price of its stock dropped back to a low of $0.025 and has traded between $0.025 - $0.125 from September 1, 2010 - September 1, 2011.[52]

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]
Key people[edit]

Alfred H. Falk, President/CEO: Falk was promoted and re-appointed President and CEO of the company on January 20, 2009. He formerly served as President and a member of the Board from January 1997 (and from July 1998 as CEO) until July 2004 when he resigned to again become e.Digital's Vice President (VP) of Corporate Development.[citation needed]
Allen Cocumelli, Chairman of the Board: Cocumelli has served on e.Digital's Board of Directors since 1999. He was re-appointed Chairman in October 2008 upon the resignation of Chairman Alex Diaz, having previously served as Chairman from April 2000 to November 2002.[citation needed]

Notoriety[edit]
e.Digital is perhaps best known for a phenomenal rise in the price of its stock during the dot-com bubble from a low of $0.06 in January 1999 to an intra-day peak of $24.50 on January 24, 2000, fuelled primarily by speculation on multiple internet message boards, most prominently the RagingBull.com forum[47] that the stock would become listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[48][49][50] The share price quickly receded and NASDAQ eventually denied the listing.[51] The price of its stock dropped back to a low of $0.025 and has traded between $0.025 - $0.125 from September 1, 2010 - September 1, 2011.[52]

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]

Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Digital Equipment Corporation
From 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.
Initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the PDP-8, widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the PDP-11 in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.
Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.
The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[1][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[2] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.
Products[edit]
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.[3]
Research[edit]
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were operated by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Systems Research Center (SRC) in Palo Alto, California, US
Network Systems Laboratory (NSL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US
Paris Research Laboratory (PRL) in Paris, France
MetroWest Technology Campus (MTC) in Maynard, Massachusetts, US

Some of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&D in general include:

Gordon Bell: technical visionary, VP Engineering 1972–83; Microsoft Research
Leonard Bosack
Henry Burkhardt III: co-founder of Data General Corporation and Kendall Square Research
Mike Burrows
Luca Cardelli
Dave Cutler: led RSX-11M and VAX/VMS operating systems development; then led Windows NT development at Microsoft[discuss]
Ed deCastro: co-founder of Data General Corporation
Alan Eustace
Jim Gettys: early developer of X Window System[discuss]
Henri Gouraud
Jim Gray
Alan Kotok
Leslie Lamport
Butler Lampson
Louis Monier
Isaac Nassi
Radia Perlman
Marcus Ranum
Brian Reid
Paul Vixie

Some of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp who were responsible for developing Alpha and StrongARM:

Daniel W. Dobberpuhl
Jim Keller
Rich Witek

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the Digital Technical Journal,[4] which was in published from 1985 until 1998.[5]

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Accomplishments and legacy[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (August 2016)


DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Digital Equipment Corporation
From 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.
Initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the PDP-8, widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the PDP-11 in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.
Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.
The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[1][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[2] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.
Products[edit]
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.[3]
Research[edit]
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were operated by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Systems Research Center (SRC) in Palo Alto, California, US
Network Systems Laboratory (NSL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US
Paris Research Laboratory (PRL) in Paris, France
MetroWest Technology Campus (MTC) in Maynard, Massachusetts, US

Some of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&D in general include:

Gordon Bell: technical visionary, VP Engineering 1972–83; Microsoft Research
Leonard Bosack
Henry Burkhardt III: co-founder of Data General Corporation and Kendall Square Research
Mike Burrows
Luca Cardelli
Dave Cutler: led RSX-11M and VAX/VMS operating systems development; then led Windows NT development at Microsoft[discuss]
Ed deCastro: co-founder of Data General Corporation
Alan Eustace
Jim Gettys: early developer of X Window System[discuss]
Henri Gouraud
Jim Gray
Alan Kotok
Leslie Lamport
Butler Lampson
Louis Monier
Isaac Nassi
Radia Perlman
Marcus Ranum
Brian Reid
Paul Vixie

Some of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp who were responsible for developing Alpha and StrongARM:

Daniel W. Dobberpuhl
Jim Keller
Rich Witek

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the Digital Technical Journal,[4] which was in published from 1985 until 1998.[5]

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]
Key people[edit]

Woody Norris, Founder
Alfred H. Falk, President/CEO: Falk was promoted and re-appointed President and CEO of the company on January 20, 2009. He formerly served as President and a member of the Board from January 1997 (and from July 1998 as CEO) until July 2004 when he resigned to again become e.Digital's Vice President (VP) of Corporate Development.[citation needed]
Allen Cocumelli, Chairman of the Board: Cocumelli has served on e.Digital's Board of Directors since 1999. He was re-appointed Chairman in October 2008 upon the resignation of Chairman Alex Diaz, having previously served as Chairman from April 2000 to November 2002.[citation needed]

Notoriety[edit]
e.Digital is perhaps best known for a phenomenal rise in the price of its stock during the dot-com bubble from a low of $0.06 in January 1999 to an intra-day peak of $24.50 on January 24, 2000, fuelled primarily by speculation on multiple internet message boards, most prominently the RagingBull.com forum[47] that the stock would become listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[48][49][50] The share price quickly receded and NASDAQ eventually denied the listing.[51] The price of its stock dropped back to a low of $0.025 and has traded between $0.025 - $0.125 from September 1, 2010 - September 1, 2011.[52]

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]
Key people[edit]

Woody Norris, Founder
Alfred H. Falk, President/CEO: Falk was promoted and re-appointed President and CEO of the company on January 20, 2009. He formerly served as President and a member of the Board from January 1997 (and from July 1998 as CEO) until July 2004 when he resigned to again become e.Digital's Vice President (VP) of Corporate Development.[citation needed]
Allen Cocumelli, Chairman of the Board: Cocumelli has served on e.Digital's Board of Directors since 1999. He was re-appointed Chairman in October 2008 upon the resignation of Chairman Alex Diaz, having previously served as Chairman from April 2000 to November 2002.[citation needed]

Notoriety[edit]
e.Digital is perhaps best known for a phenomenal rise in the price of its stock during the dot-com bubble from a low of $0.06 in January 1999 to an intra-day peak of $24.50 on January 24, 2000, fuelled primarily by speculation on multiple internet message boards, most prominently the RagingBull.com forum[47] that the stock would become listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[48][49][50] The share price quickly receded and NASDAQ eventually denied the listing.[51] The price of its stock dropped back to a low of $0.025 and has traded between $0.025 - $0.125 from September 1, 2010 - September 1, 2011.[52]

Corporate history[edit]
The Company was incorporated under the Company Act in the Province of British Columbia, Canada on February 11, 1988 under the name 340520 B.C. Ltd. and changed its name to Norris Communications Corp. on April 7, 1988. On November 22, 1994 the Company changed its jurisdiction to the Yukon Territory. In August, 1996, jurisdiction was changed to the State of Wyoming.[2]
The company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in September, 1996 as Norris Communications, Inc. In January, 1999 stockholders approved a name change to e.Digital Corporation.[3]
Financial status[edit]
Throughout its over 22-year history, e.Digital / Norris Communications continuously lost money. The accumulated deficit at March 31, 2010 was $80 million.[1] Although the company reported its first annual profit for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 due to settlements with six of eight defendants of its patent infringement lawsuits which resulted in one-time licensing fees totalling $10.1 million,[4] the company returned to an unprofitable status in fiscal year 2010, posting a net loss of $985,000. Revenue for products totalled $205,000 with service revenue totalling $749,000. Patent infringement settlement income totalled $1,600,000 for total revenue of $2,554,000.[1]
Growing concern warnings[edit]
e.Digital's accountants, Singer Lewak Greenbaum & Goldstein, LLP of Santa Ana, California, state the following in their opinion letter dated June 15, 2009 attached to the company's 10-K annual report for FY 2009:[5] -

" As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has historically suffered recurring losses from operations and has a substantial accumulated deficit. This raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In its 10-K annual statement filed on June 16, 2009, e.Digital made additional disclosures regarding doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern:[6]

"Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (fiscal 2009), we incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations. Our recent profitability has resulted from one-time patent licensing revenues and there is no assurance of future licensing revenues from new licensees. Accordingly, we could incur losses in the future until product, service and/or licensing revenues are sufficient to sustain continued profitability. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and is dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations."

Products[edit]

1988–1993 - No products. Most income came from a manufacturing subsidiary of Norris called American Surface Mounted Devices.
1994–1996 - Norris Communications unveiled and marketed its Flashback, claimed to be the first portable digital voice recorder with removable flash memory. The device employed the then newly developed Norris Flash File System (NFFS), later renamed MicroOS.
1997–2000 - e.Digital's sole paying customer was Lanier for which it developed and manufactured through Eltech Electronics, Inc., a portable digital dictation device and docking station named Cquence Mobile to interface with Lanier's existing Cquence digital dictation system for hospitals.
2001–2003 – The company sold rebranded Digitalway digital audio players as well as developing and marketing its own branded players, some of which included a speech recognition feature licensed from Lucent, which e.Digital trademarked as "VoiceNav."[7] The rebranded and e.Digital-developed products were not widely accepted and resulted in gross losses of over 100% of direct product costs. During this time e.Digital also operated a free music website at domain www.wedigmusic.com.[8]
2003–2006: e.Digital's only customer was APS/digEcor for which it provided custom product design and manufacturing oversight of the digEplayer 5500 originally through South Korean OEM Digitalway and subsequently South Korean OEM Maycom.
2006–2015: e.Digital's last product, its eVU portable media player offered to airlines for use as a portable in-flight entertainment device, was discontinued in 2015.[9]

Services[edit]
Throughout most of its history, Norris Communications/e.Digital Corporation offered engineering services, MP3 player reference designs and custom prototype and product design. From 2006 until 2015, service offerings were exclusively tied to the eVU product, including warranty service, media content procurement/refreshing and hardware repair.[citation needed]
Intellectual property[edit]
e.Digital owns five patents which it refers to as its Flash-R patent portfolio.[10] The company has made licensing of its patented "MicroOS" flash file system, originally called the "Norris Flash File System" or "NFFS,"[11][12][13] a priority since 1997. The company says it believes that its patent holdings relating to flash memory are "fundamental and valuable, particularly in the areas of content file management, optimal flash memory management, and in removable flash applications."[citation needed]
In February 2006, e.Digital announced that it was pursuing monetization of its patent portfolio.[14]
On December 21, 2006 the company stated to shareholders that it had "identified 174 companies with 1,372 products that appear to employ our patent portfolio."[15] On December 20, 2007 it further expanded its claim by stating: “To date, we have identified annual U.S. revenues of more than $20 billion from what we believe are infringing products from such companies."[16]
In March 2007 the company engaged the law firm of Duane Morris LLP to pursue patent infringement claims on a contingent fee basis. The agreement grants Duane Morris 40 - 50% of all settlements and awards after full reimbursement for expenses incurred.[17] The contigency fee agreement also provides a lien resulting in e.Digital's patents being officially assigned to Duane Morris.[18]
Patent infringement litigation[edit]

The company filed its first lawsuit for infringement of its patents on August 1, 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California for infringement of patent number 5,491,774. Defendants were Taiwanese corporations Simate Corp. and Leading Accessories Inc. and their North American distributors James H. Rochel and J.T.L. Enterprises Inc.[19] Outcome of that lawsuit is unknown.
On December 6, 1996, the company announced a letter of intent to create a strategic and tactical alliance with competing company Voice It Worldwide Inc.[20] Despite the fact that Voice It also claimed to be the first to use removable memory in a digital recorder,[21] the company did not sue for infringement of its patent.
On September 7, 2007, e.Digital filed its second lawsuit for patent infringement against Vivitar Corporation this time in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas on 4 of its 5 patents.[22][23] Vivitar responded by denying the infringement claims and filing counterclaims seeking declaratory relief/summary judgement that the patents are non-infringed and invalid. In March 2009, the court administratively closed the case due to Vivitar's bankruptcy.


On March 4, 2008, e.Digital filed an almost identical lawsuit, also in the Marshall Division, Eastern District of Texas against Casio America, Inc., Avid Technology Inc., LG Electronics USA, Inc., Nikon, Incorporated, Olympus America, Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Sanyo North America Corporation.[24][25] As of March 31, 2009, settlements had been reached with 6 defendants, leaving Samsung as the sole remaining defendant. On April 2, 2009 e.Digital dismissed all claims for 2 of the 4 patents it had alleged Samsung infringed. e.Digital and Samsung executed a settlement agreement in September, 2009.[citation needed]
On November 2, 2009, e.Digital filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of patent number 5,491,774 in the Federal District Court for Colorado against Pentax of America, Inc., Hoya Corporation, Hoya Corporation USA, Canon USA, Inc., Canon Inc., Coby Electronics Corporation, DXG Technology (U.S.A.), Inc., DXG Technology, Inc., HTC America, Inc., HTC Corporation, Ikegami Electronics (USA), Inc., Imation Corporation, Kyocera Communications, Inc., Kyocera Wireless, Inc., Kyocera International, Inc., Kyocera Corporation, Leica Camera, Inc., Leica Camera AG, Marantz America, Inc., D&M Holdings U.S. Inc., D&M Holdings, Inc., Nokia, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Panasonic Corporation, Summit Global Group, LLC, Roland Systems Group U.S., Roland Corporation, Sakar International, Inc., Samson Technologies Corp., Teac America, Inc., VTech Electronics North America, LLC and TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA Wolverine Data).[26]

Settlements[edit]

On September 25, 2008, e.Digital announced the first settlement of its patent infringement lawsuits. A subsequent court filing releasing LG Electronics USA, Inc. as a defendant identified it as the settling party. The gross settlement amount reported in form 10-Q was $1.6 million.[27]
On December 2, 2008, e.Digital announced a settlement and cross licensing agreement with Casio.[28] The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $1.65 million.[29]
On December 17, 2008, e.Digital and Nikon Inc. filed a joint motion with the Court stating they had reached a settlement of their dispute. The gross settlement fee as calculated from data in the quarterly report was $2.0 million.[29]
In February 2009, e.Digital reached settlements with Avid Technology, Olympus America Inc. and Sanyo North America according to court filings. Financial terms were not disclosed but e.Digital booked $4,865,350 in gross settlement fees from the 3 companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.[30]
In September 2009, e.Digital executed a settlement agreement with Samsung according to court filings. The gross settlement amount reported in the 10-Q quarterly report for the period ended September 30, 2009 was $1.25 million.[31]
On December 10, 2009, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with TIC Computer, Inc. (DBA as Wolverine Data) which included an undisclosed lump-sum payment and an undisclosed royalty for any on-going sales of products that practice e.Digital’s U.S. Patent 5,491,774.[32] According to e.Digital's quarterly report, the lump-sum payment is not due to be paid until November 2010.[33]
In March 2010, e.Digital announced a settlement agreement with Ikegami Electronics (USA) which provided an undisclosed on-going royalty[34] as well as a settlement agreement with the two Roland entities which included an undisclosed one-time fee.[35]

Legal disputes[edit]
digEcor v. e.Digital Corporation[edit]

In March 2006, e.Digital announced that its contract manufacturer, Maycom, was either unwilling or unable to fulfill a purchase order e.Digital had placed to fulfill a purchase order from its customer digEcor for 1,250 digEplayers and batteries.[36]


In May 2006, digEcor, filed a lawsuit against e.Digital regarding the non-delivery of its pre-paid purchase order placed in November, 2005. digEcor sought, among other things, actual damages of $793,750, consequential damages of not less than $1,000,000. e.Digital eventually delivered the players to digEcor without batteries in October 2006 and the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement reducing the actual damages claim to $80,000 for the undelivered batteries. digEcor also sought an injunction barring e.Digital from engaging in any competition with digEcor until after 2009, alleging violation by e.Digital of an April 2002 agreement[37] not to compete with digEcor for a period of 7 years it entered into with Bill Boyer Jr., original owner of digEcor (then named APS) and conceiver of the product and business model.[38] Because the agreement did not specify which State's laws should be applied, the court had to make the determination. The court decided that the agreement should be held to California State law, which disallows non-compete agreements.[citation needed]


On September 10, 2009, the court ruled against digEcor on all remaining claims against e.Digital. No damages or injunctive relief were awarded to digEcor.[39] On October 15, 2009, the court modified its previous summary judgement to reflect its award of $80,000 in favor of digEcor and against e.Digital for undelievered batteries.[40] The companies later filed an agreement with the court to settle that claim for $60,000 to be paid by e.Digital to digEcor.[citation needed]

Investor information[edit]
In 2017, Fred Falk filed for bankruptcy. In a turnaround from the previous quarterly statement, his company which had no debt decided to file bankruptcy and give the patents to lawyers as payment for services rendered. While this appears corrupt and if so, Falk should be in jail, the shareholders are in line to receive nothing.

Shares outstanding[edit]
As of June 1, 2010, basic shares outstanding of e.Digital’s common stock totalled 286,050,900.[41]
Annual meetings of shareholders[edit]
Despite that Delaware General Corporation Law and e.Digital's own corporate by-laws require the company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect directors and officers and transact other business,[42] the company did not hold a meeting of shareholders between August 2005 and September 2008. The five prior meetings were held in December 2003, November 2002, 2001 and 2000 and January 1999.[43]
On September 17, 2008 e.Digital held an annual meeting of the stockholders and approved an increase in the number of authorized common stock shares from 300,000,000 to 350,000,000.[44] e.Digital held its 2009 annual meeting on November 19, 2009 at the company's office. The company's directors were reelected and accountants were ratified.[45]
On September 29, 2010, e.Digital announced that its next annual meeting of the stockholders would be postponed until February 2011.[46]

Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1950s to the 1990s.
DEC was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals. Their PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Digital Equipment Corporation
From 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.
Initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the PDP-8, widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the PDP-11 in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.
Originally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's VAX-11 series was the first widely used 32-bit minicomputer, sometimes referred to as "superminis". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers, such as the IBM System/370. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.
The rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices[1][better source needed] were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.
DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry.[2] At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. As of 2007[update] some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.
Products[edit]
Beyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was well respected for its communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its "dumb terminal" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.[3]
Research[edit]
DEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were operated by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:

Western Research Laboratory (WRL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Systems Research Center (SRC) in Palo Alto, California, US
Network Systems Laboratory (NSL) in Palo Alto, California, US
Cambridge Research Laboratory (CRL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US
Paris Research Laboratory (PRL) in Paris, France
MetroWest Technology Campus (MTC) in Maynard, Massachusetts, US

Some of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&D in general include:

Gordon Bell: technical visionary, VP Engineering 1972–83; Microsoft Research
Leonard Bosack
Henry Burkhardt III: co-founder of Data General Corporation and Kendall Square Research
Mike Burrows
Luca Cardelli
Dave Cutler: led RSX-11M and VAX/VMS operating systems development; then led Windows NT development at Microsoft[discuss]
Ed deCastro: co-founder of Data General Corporation
Alan Eustace
Jim Gettys: early developer of X Window System[discuss]
Henri Gouraud
Jim Gray
Alan Kotok
Leslie Lamport
Butler Lampson
Louis Monier
Isaac Nassi
Radia Perlman
Marcus Ranum
Brian Reid
Paul Vixie

Some of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp who were responsible for developing Alpha and StrongARM:

Daniel W. Dobberpuhl
Jim Keller
Rich Witek

Some of the work of the Research Labs was published in the Digital Technical Journal,[4] which was in published from 1985 until 1998.[5]
Accomplishments and legacy[edit]

DEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.
The first versions of the C language and the Unix operating system ran on DEC's PDP series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the PDP-11's), which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.
DEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including OS-8, TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RSTS/E, RSX-11, RT-11, and OpenVMS. PDP computers, in particular the PDP-11 model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of time-sharing systems.
The command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as DCL, would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as CTSS, IBM's JCL, or Univac's time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the CP/M and MS-DOS CLI show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the "name-dot-extension" file naming conventions.
VAX and MicroVAX computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running VMS formed one of the most important proprietary networks, DECnet, which linked business and research facilities. The DECnet protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.
DEC, Intel and Xerox through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of Ethernet, but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and LAT protocols interconnected VAXes with DECserver terminal servers. Starting with the Unibus to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI "computer interconnect" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive "rings".
DEC also invented clustering, an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as Network of Workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.
The LA36 and LA120 dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the Teletype Corporation.
The VT100 computer terminal became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the ANSI X3.64 standard, and even today terminal emulators such as HyperTerminal, PuTTY and Xterm still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the VT220).
The X Window System, the network transparent window system used on Unix and Linux, and also available on other operating systems, was developed at MIT jointly between Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the GNU Project but not associated with it.
In the period 1994–99 Linus Torvalds developed versions of Linux on early AlphaServer systems made available to him by the engineering department.[disputed – discuss] Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.[6] A well-known Linux distribution that ran on AlphaServer systems was Red Hat 7.2.[7] Another distribution that ran on Alpha was Gentoo Linux.
Notes-11 and its follow-on product, VAX Notes, were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as groupware. Len Kawell, one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined Lotus Development Corporation and contributed to their Lotus Notes product.
DEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with dec.com, registered in 1985,[8] being one of the first of the now ubiquitous .com domains. DEC's gatekeeper.dec.com was a well-known software repository during the pre-World Wide Web days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.[9] The popular AltaVista, created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet search engines. (Although Lycos was earlier, it was much more limited.)
DEC invented Digital Linear Tape (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.
Work on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the Personal Jukebox, started at the DEC Systems Research Center. (The project was started about a month before the merger into Compaq was completed.)
DEC's Western Research Lab created the Itsy Pocket Computer. This was developed into the Compaq iPaq line of PDAs, which replaced the Compaq Aero PDA.
Digital Federal Credit Union (DCU) is a credit union which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.
DEC once held the Class A IP address block 16.0.0.0/8.[10]
User organizations[edit]
Originally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.

Ronran..JMHO...   If I have a product, and am doing a patent search... e.Digital is who shows up, as ownership of those patents. The verbiage that shows up, is fairly clear, to the reader. There is no "it depends" there. You need to talk to e.Digital...What goes on, beyond that, is up to e.Digital, but they clearly have the say... Possession is 9/10 of the law...   Not to say it wasn't reassigned, and simply not noted yet, but... It would have to be, somewhere in the process, for Licensing take place, for PN to use his own creation...You own it, or you license it.   I would further note, that e.Digital had cross licensing rights with Samsung.. I would think that would be fairly valuable too, as an asset.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
