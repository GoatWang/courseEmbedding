	Item 29. Persons Controlled by or Under Common Control with Registrant




	Not applicable.




	Item 30. Indemnification









	Registrant's By-Laws, Item 28(b) of this Registration Statement, provides, in summary, that officers and trustees/directors shall be indemnified by Registrant against liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with actions, suits, or proceedings arising out of their offices or duties of employment, except that no indemnification can be made to such a person if he has been adjudged liable of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of his duties. In the absence of such an adjudication, the determination of eligibility for indemnification shall be made by independent counsel in a written opinion or by the vote of a majority of a quorum of trustees/directors who are neither "interested persons" of Registrant, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor parties to the proceeding.









	Registrant may purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any officer, trustee, director, employee or agent against any liabilities arising from such status. In this regard, Registrant will maintain an insurance policy, providing Registrant with trustees/directors and officers liability coverage, plus excess trustees/directors and officers liability coverage for the independent trustees/directors only. Registrant also maintains an Investment Company Blanket Bond. The Fund maintains joint coverage with the other Calvert Funds, and for the liability coverage, with the Advisor and its affiliated companies ("Calvert operating companies.") The premium and the coverage are allocated based on a method approved by the disinterested Fund trustees/directors.









	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), may be permitted to directors, trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant and the principal underwriter pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, trustee, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant and the principal underwriter in connection with the successful defense of any action, suite or proceeding) is asserted against the Registrant by such director, trustee, officer or controlling person or principal underwriter in connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Applicability









	This Code of Ethics (the “Code”) applies to Calvert Investments, Inc., including its subsidiaries Calvert Investment Management, Inc., Calvert Investment Distributors, Inc., Calvert Investment Services, Inc. and Calvert Investment Administrative Services, Inc. (collectively “Calvert”). The Code applies to all Calvert Associates.









	Introduction









	The Code was developed in accordance with Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (“Advisers Act”), Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, which require, among other things, the adoption of a written code of ethics by all investment advisors, investment companies and their principal underwriters. The Code is designed to set standards of business conduct for all Trustees/Directors, Officers and Associates of Calvert and the Calvert Funds. It is designed to promote ethical standards when dealing with the public, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to prevent inappropriate trading practices. Active leadership and integrity of management dictates these principles be diligently implemented and monitored.









	The following general fiduciary principles and standards of business conduct shall govern personal investment activities and the interpretation and administration of this Code:


















	•






	The interests of Calvert's Clients, including Calvert Fund shareholders, must be placed first at all times;
















	•






	All personal securities transactions must be conducted consistent with the Code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of an individual’s position of trust and responsibility;
















	•






	Access Persons should not take inappropriate advantage of their positions; and
















	•






	Access Persons must comply with the applicable federal securities laws.












	This Code does not attempt to identify all possible conflicts of interest, and literal compliance with each of its specific provisions will not shield Access Persons from liability for personal trading or other conduct that violates a fiduciary duty to Calvert's Clients and Calvert Fund shareholders.

Access Persons shall not disclose to persons outside the firm any material nonpublic information about any Client or shareholder, the securities investments made by the firm on behalf of a Client or shareholder, information about contemplated securities transactions, or information regarding the firm’s trading strategies, except as required to effectuate securities transactions on behalf of a Client or shareholder, or for other legitimate business purposes.









	In addition, to ensure that some Clients/shareholders or competitors are not able to receive portfolio information earlier than other Clients/shareholders or competitors and to ensure that the information is no longer material to affect the firm’s trading strategies, all Access Persons are required to comply with the provisions of the Portfolio Holdings Disclosure Policy.









	Access Persons are prohibited from disclosing non-public information concerning Clients or securities transactions to non-Calvert Associates, except for legitimate business purposes. Any questions about the propriety of information being shared should be directed to the CCO.









	Further, Access Persons shall not originate or circulate in any manner a rumor concerning any security which the Associate knows or has reasonable grounds for believing is false or misleading or would improperly influence the market price of such security.







































	III.    Personal Trading Activities









	A.    Prohibited Activities









	The Code of Ethics imposes the following general obligations:













	4

































	•






	Information concerning the purchase and sale of securities learned in connection with an Access Person’s employment is property of Calvert and/or its Clients and may not be used for personal benefit.
















	•






	Fiduciary duties mandate suitable investment opportunities be presented first to Calvert and its Clients and should only be exercised for personal benefit after full disclosure and approval from the CCO or designee.
















	•






	Material inside information must be kept confidential and restricts trading of securities.
















	•






	Front running, market manipulation and deceptive trading practices are abusive techniques prohibited by these procedures and may result in fines, termination or legal actions by Calvert or third parties.
















	•






	Access Persons must not engage in market timing of the Calvert Funds. This prohibition includes Calvert Funds held directly with Calvert as well as those held in any account in which the Access Person has Beneficial Interest (including 401(k) accounts).
















	•






	Access Persons are prohibited from purchasing Initial Public Offerings (“IPO”), which is a corporation’s first offering of stock to the public, including secondary issues of equity.
















	•






	Access Persons must not trade in a security based on knowledge that the security is being considered for purchase or sale for a Client.
















	•






	Access Persons must not engage in transactions that create a conflict of interest including but not limited to inappropriately making decisions on behalf of a Client regarding securities or private placements personally owned by the Access Person.













	Temporary employees and interns at Calvert are subject to this Code of Ethics as they potentially have the same access to information as permanent employees; however, recognizing the short-term nature of this type of arrangement with Calvert, temporary employees and interns are not subject to using the PTA system unless so directed by the CCO; but rather, are restricted in their ability to trade securities. Accordingly, temporary employees and interns who have not been instructed to use the PTA system are prohibited from purchasing or selling securities during their tenure with Calvert, unless having received prior written approval from the CCO.



















	1.    


	Blackout Periods









	a.    


	All Access Persons




	            




	All Access Persons are prohibited from buying or selling a security (that requires preclearance) which has been purchased or sold on behalf of a Client within the preceding seven (7) days.













	5






















	b.    


	Investment Personnel









	No Investment Personnel of a Client Account shall buy or sell a security (that requires preclearance) within seven (7) days before and after that the security has been purchased or sold on behalf of a Client.









	c.    


	Exemption from Blackout Periods









	The CCO may exempt from the prohibitions in this section certain trades during blackout periods that coincide with trading by certain Client Accounts (e.g., index funds).









	2.    


	Short-Term Trading









	Access Persons are generally prohibited from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of a security (that requires preclearance) within 60 calendar days. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the CCO.









	B.    Pre-Clearance Requirements









	All Access Persons are required to obtain pre-clearance for trades in Securities and private placements, in accounts in which he or she has Beneficial Interest or exercises control/trading discretion. Except as noted below, no transaction in Securities may be effected without a properly obtained pre-clearance.









	Requests for pre-clearance approval are made through the PTA system, as discussed further below under Section V.


	The PTA system will process the pre-clearance request automatically. If there is a problem, the CCO or designee will contact the requester to further discuss the request and determine if it will be approved or denied.









	The pre-clearance authorization shall be valid for


	same-day execution only


	. The window for preclearance will open at


	10:00 a.m.


	 EST, and all transactions must be completed by the close of business at


	5:30 p.m.


	 that same day. If the order for a personal Securities transaction is not placed by the close of business on the day on which it is obtained, a new authorization must be obtained.









	Please note that obtaining pre-clearance approval will not excuse an Access Person from the general prohibitions listed in the Code or the Policies and Procedures designed to prevent insider trading.









	1.    


	Exempted Transactions













	6






















	The following transactions are exempt from the Pre-Clearance Requirements


	, but may be subject to the Reporting Requirements set forth below in Section IV:


















	•






	The sale and/or purchase of Non-Reportable Securities (see definition above);
















	•






	Transactions in Calvert Funds;


















	•






	Transactions effected through an automatic investment plan (e.g., dividend reinvestment plan);
















	•






	Acquisitions through stock dividend plans, spin-offs or other distributions applied to all holders of the same class of securities (corporate actions);

















	•






	Acquisitions through gifts or bequests;
















	•






	Acquisitions pursuant to an automatic investment plan; or
















	•






	Trades in variable insurance products.





















	2.






	Discretionary Accounts












	Transactions in accounts for which investment discretion has been assigned to a


	financial advisor, registered representative, or other financial professional (“Financial Professional”)


	 are generally exempt from the Pre-Clearance Requirements


	, but may be subject to the Reporting Requirements set forth below in Section IV.


	 If investment discretion has been granted to a Financial Professional”, an Access Person must provide their Financial Professional with a letter, in the form provided by the CCO or designee (


	see Attachment A to this Code of Ethics


	), and the letter must be completed and returned to the attention of the CCO or designee. Once documented, the purchase or sale of a security on behalf of an Access Person, pursuant to this disclaimer, will not be subject to the pre-clearance requirements;


	however, all other aspects of this Code must be adhered to


	. For example, IPOs cannot be purchased for your account by your financial advisor even though discretion has been granted. You must provide a copy of the Code of Ethics to your financial advisor, as their trading activity in your account could result in a violation for which you will be held accountable.
























	C.    


	Allowable Activities











	1.    


	Private Placements











	All private placement requests must be submitted in writing (which may be by e-mail) to the CCO or designee, and the proposed transaction will be








	7






















	approved only after considering, among other facts, whether the investment opportunity should be reserved for a Client and whether the opportunity is being offered to the person by virtue of the person’s position with the firm (i.e., as Investment Personnel). Investment Personnel who have acquired a Beneficial Interest in a private placement are required to disclose their Beneficial Interest to the CCO. If any such Investment Personnel are subsequently involved in a decision to buy or sell a Security from the same issuer for a Client, then the decision to purchase or sell the Security must be independently authorized by a Portfolio Manager with no personal interest in the issuer.









	The CCO shall maintain a record of any decision, and the reasons supporting the decision, to approve the acquisition by Access Persons of private placements.









	2.    


	Investment Clubs









	Access Persons may participate in an investment club; however the account must be


	treated as any other brokerage account


	. An Access Person who is a member of an investment club is required to pre-clear club transactions. Execution of non-pre-cleared trades made by the investment club will result in a violation for the Access Person. When forming or joining an investment club, the following must be provided to Legal/Compliance:


















	•






	A copy of the investment club's bylaws;


















	•






	Upon request, any additional information about the investment club, including a list of the members in the club and an indication if any members are employees or associated persons of Calvert or Ameritas; and

















	•






	The contact person for the investment club in case of questions.












	D.    


	Independent and Non-Employee Trustees/Directors









	Independent Trustees/Directors and Non-Employee Trustees/Directors deemed Access Persons solely by reason of being a Trustee/Director are not subject to the provisions of sections A.1, A.2, B and C of this Article III, and may invest in IPOs and make other investments without disclosure, review or approval from the CCO (except for the reporting requirements as set forth below at Section IV.E) so long as any such investment is consistent with that Trustee/Director’s fiduciary duty to Clients, including the Calvert Funds and Fund shareholders.









	IV.    Reporting Requirements













	8






















	Unless an exception is granted, within 90 days’ of employment, all Access Persons are required to maintain their Brokerage Accounts with an electronic reporting firm (See Exhibit I to this Code of Ethics).









	A.    


	Initial/Annual Holdings Report









	No later than ten (10) business days after becoming an Access Person, and annually thereafter, each Access Person must report all personal holdings of Reportable Securities to the CCO, using the PTA system. The initial and annual reports must be current as of a date not more than 45 days before the report is submitted. Any reports of initial/annual holdings that are not submitted by the date they are due may be considered late and reported as violations of the Code of Ethics. Any report of initial/annual holdings shall contain the following information:


















	a.






	The title, number of shares, and principal amount of each Reportable Security in which the Access Person has any direct or indirect Beneficial Interest, or over which the Access Person has the ability to exercise control/trading discretion; and





















	b.






	The name of any broker, dealer, or bank with whom the Access Person maintains an account in which any Reportable Securities were held for the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person, or over which the Access Person has the ability to exercise control/trading discretion.












	B.    


	Quarterly Transaction Reports









	All personal securities transactions involving Reportable Securities must be reported to the CCO on no less than a quarterly basis. As set forth above, an Access Person must satisfy his or her quarterly reporting requirement by maintaining all Brokerage Accounts in which Reportable Securities are held with an electronic reporting firm.











	C.    


	Reporting Requirements for 401(k) Accounts









	Access Persons must report the existence of any 401(k) account established by another employer, but generally need not disclose the holdings in the account unless such securities are Reportable Securities (


	e.g.,


	 the employer’s equity securities). Additionally, for the purposes of a 401(k) account maintained by another employer, Access Persons effecting any otherwise reportable transaction therein will be required to receive pre-clearance approval for such transactions using the PTA system. If the account is subsequently rolled over into any account (other than the Access Person’s Calvert/Ameritas 401(k) account), the resulting account and all holdings therein will be subject to the full provisions of the Code of Ethics.








	9



























	There are no reporting requirements under this Code applicable to an Access Person’s Calvert/Ameritas 401(k) account. Access Persons are not required to pre-clear elections or when changing their salary deferred contribution percentages.









	D.    


	Annual Certification of Compliance









	Annually the CCO or designee will contact all Calvert Associates for certification of compliance with the Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy and Procedures, as well as certification to the completeness of his/her financial records, as captured by the PTA system; to be submitted via the PTA system within the proscribed time period imposed by the CCO. Failure to complete all certifications within the proscribed time period may be treated as a violation of the Code of Ethics.









	All Access Persons are required to certify annually that they have:









	1.    received, read and understand the Code of Ethics;




	2.    complied with the provisions of the Code of Ethics;




	3.    disclosed all Brokerage Accounts;




	4.    disclosed all Reportable Securities owned; and




	5.    not, and will not, effect transactions in Calvert Funds based on




	material nonpublic information.









	See Exhibit I “Securities Reporting for Access Persons” for a summary of the Reporting and Pre-Clearance Requirements by Security Type.









	E.    


	Independent and Non-Employee Trustees/Directors









	Independent Trustees/Directors and Non-Employee Trustees/Directors deemed Access Persons solely by reason of being a Trustee/Director, need not make any report or certification otherwise required by the Article IV unless the Trustee/Director knew or, in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a Trustee/Director, should have known (at the time of his or her transaction) that during the 15-day period immediately before and after the Trustee/Director’s transaction in a Reportable Security, that Reportable Security was purchased or sold, or was considered for purchase or sale for, a Client including the Calvert Funds.














	V.    Access Person Use of Personal Trading Assistant (PTA) System









	Calvert has implemented the Personal Trading Assistant (PTA) system, through which each Access Person reports, among other things, his or her Brokerage








	10






















	Accounts and Reportable Securities. PTA is an automated reporting process, through which brokerage statements and confirmations are submitted electronically, thereby allowing several screens to be run on each securities transaction to confirm that there have been no compliance violations.









	On their start date or promptly thereafter, the Access Person will receive an e-mail providing him/her with a temporary login name and password. Within ten (10) business days from their start date, the Access Person must log onto the system and certify to the Code of Ethics, as well as disclosure of their Brokerage Accounts and initial holdings, as reported pursuant to Section IV.A above.









	Each Access Person must certify his/her compliance with the Code of Ethics annually, as well as annually certify to the correctness of the securities holdings as submitted through the PTA system.









	Note: Each Access Person (other than Independent and Non-Employee Trustees/Directors), regardless of whether he or she has a Brokerage Account, has an account established in, and is required to submit pre-clearance requests for political contributions, report gifts and entertainment, and complete all required certifications (Calvert Code of Ethics, Ameritas Companies Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Brokerage Account(s), Initial Holdings, Transactions in Calvert Funds, Calvert Social Media Policy and Calvert Telephone, E-mail, Workstation and Internet Use Policy), through the PTA system.









	While Calvert utilizes the PTA system to preclear political contributions requests, report gifts and entertainment, and to annually complete certifications for the Ameritas Companies Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Calvert Social Media Policy and Calvert Telephone, E-Mail, Workstation and Internet Use Policy, these requirements are separate and distinct from, and operate independently from the Code.









	In general, all Pre-Clearance Requests (per Section III.B. above), Reports of Initial and Annual Holdings (per Section IV above), Political Contribution Pre-Clearance Requests (see separate policy) and Reports of Gifts and Entertainment (see separate policy), are to be submitted via the PTA system.









	See the separate “Frequently Asked Questions About Calvert’s Code of Ethics and The Personal Trading Assistant (PTA) System” for general guidance on the reporting requirements and use of the PTA system.









	VI.    Directorships




	        




	A.    


	General Rule – For-Profit Companies













	11






















	Calvert Associates may serve on the board of directors of a publicly held or private for-profit company, provided prior written approval is granted by the Boards of Directors/Trustees of Calvert Investments, Inc. and the Calvert Funds. Calvert Associates must complete and receive the required approvals using the “Application For Calvert Associate to be on For-Profit Company Board of Directors.”


	See Attachment B to this Code of Ethics.









	In addition, Calvert Associates are required to report service by an immediate family member as an officer, board member, trustee, or executive member of a publicly traded company using the form provided.


	See Attachment C to this Code of Ethics.











	B.    


	General Rule – Non/Not-For-Profit Companies









	Calvert Associates may serve on the board of directors of a non/not-for-profit company subject to the general prohibitions against conflicts of interest. Such persons need not get prior approval, but must disclose the directorship using the reporting form provided.


	See Attachment C to this Code of Ethics.









	C.    


	Subsequent Investment Management Activities









	Whenever a Calvert Associate is granted approval to serve as a director of a publicly-traded or private for-profit company, he or she shall personally refrain from participating in any deliberation, recommendations, or considerations of whether or not to recommend that any Securities of that company be purchased, sold or retained in the investment portfolio of any Client.









	If any Calvert Associate serves on the board of directors of a publicly-traded company, all orders for the purchase or sale of such company’s securities must be pre-cleared using the PTA system as prescribed by the CCO or designee. Receipt of Securities in connection with the Calvert Associate’s compensation package for service on the board do not require preclearance.









	VII.    Review and Enforcement









	A.    


	Review









	Statements and confirmations, or any related reporting made via the PTA system, will be periodically reviewed by the CCO or his/her designee. Among the factors that will be considered in the analysis of whether any provision of the Code has been violated will be actual harm to client accounts; the Access Person’s job function, with greater scrutiny applied to those involved in the investment process; the Access Person’s prior compliance history; the Access Person’s cooperation and demonstrated understanding of and willingness to comply with,








	12






















	the Code, including whether the violation was self-reported; the size (monetary value) of the transaction; the Access Person’s overall account size and historic trading volume; and other extenuating circumstances (e.g., the transaction was directed by an individual other than the Access Person such as a spouse or financial adviser)









	Annually, the CCO will prepare a written “Issues and Certification Report” and provide such report to each Calvert Fund’s Board of Directors/Trustees describing any material issues that have arisen under the Code since the last report, and certifying to each Calvert Fund's Board that the adopted Code of Ethics and its procedures provide reasonably necessary measures to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code and any applicable procedures.









	The Code and any material changes to its provisions and/or procedures must be approved by the CCO and the Board of Directors of Calvert Investments, Inc. Independently, the Code may be adopted by each Calvert Fund’s Board.









	B.    


	Violations









	Any failure to comply with any of the requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions of the Code may be subject to remedial actions imposed by the CCO or his/her designee.









	Upon learning of a potential deviation from, or violation of the Code, the CCO or his/her designee will review and investigate the matter. The CCO, at his/her discretion, may present the matter to the other CCOs, the Board of Calvert Investments, Inc. and/or each Calvert Fund’s Board for further review, investigation and evaluation. The CCO will present all material violations of the Code to the Board of Directors of Calvert Investments, Inc. and the Calvert Funds’ Boards.









	C.    


	Enforcement









	The remedial actions imposed by the CCO will vary depending on the assessment of the CCO of the seriousness of the violation and the intent of the party involved.









	The CCO may impose any or all of the remedial actions below, or any other sanctions deemed appropriate, including termination, immediately and without notice, if it is determined that the severity of any violation or violations warrants such action. Any remedial action imposed upon a person will be documented in such person's personal trading file maintained by the CCO. The CEO must approve remedial actions involving termination, monetary penalties, censure or notice to regulatory authorities.













	13






















	The following is a list of remedial actions that may be imposed on persons who fail to comply with the Code of Ethics. This list is not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive list, and any remedial actions imposed will depend on the nature of the violation. Some of the remedial actions, which may be imposed, are:









	•


	Warning/retraining




	•


	memorandum of reprimand which outlines the violation of the Code;













	•






	in-person meeting with the CCO or designee, or the General Counsel to discuss compliance with the Code;
















	•






	imposition of additional restrictions (including prohibition) on personal securities transactions;







	•


	disgorgement of profits;




	•


	letter of censure;




	•


	fines;




	•


	withholding of bonus;




	•


	suspension;




	•


	termination of employment; and













	•






	notification to appropriate governmental, regulatory and/or legal authorities.












	VIII.    Confidentiality of Records and Reports









	All reports of securities transactions and any other information filed pursuant to this Code shall be treated as confidential, except as regards to appropriate examinations by representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other governmental or regulatory authorities.









	I


	X.    Insider Trading Policy and Procedures









	A.    


	Scope of Policy Statement









	This Policy Statement is drafted broadly; it will be applied and interpreted in a similar manner. This Policy Statement applies to securities trading and information handling by all Access Persons,


	trustee/directors, officers, temporary employees and interns (referred to as “Covered Persons” for the purposes of this Section IX)


	.









	The law of insider trading is unsettled; an individual legitimately may be uncertain about the application of the Policy Statement in a particular circumstance. Often, a single question can forestall disciplinary action or complex legal problems. You should direct any questions relating to the Policy Statement to an attorney in Legal/Compliance. You must also notify the General Counsel if you have any reason to believe that a violation of the Policy Statement has occurred or is about to occur.








	14



























	B.    


	Policy Statement on Insider Trading









	Calvert forbids any Covered Person from trading, either personally or on behalf of others, including Clients, on material nonpublic information or communicating material nonpublic information to others in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently referred to as "insider trading." Covered Persons will be liable for any such conduct, even where the Covered Person believes the conduct was not based on material nonpublic information. Calvert's policy applies to each Calvert Fund, its investment advisor, its principal underwriter, and every officer, director and employee thereof, and extends to activities within and outside their duties at Calvert. Every Covered Person must read and retain this policy statement. Any questions regarding Calvert's policy and procedures should be referred to the General Counsel. A Covered Person must notify the General Counsel immediately if they have any reason to believe that a violation of the Policy Statement has occurred or is about to occur.









	The term "insider trading" is not defined in the federal securities laws, but generally is used to refer to the use of material nonpublic information to trade in securities (whether or not one is an "insider") or to communications of material nonpublic information to others.









	While the law concerning insider trading is not static, it is generally understood that the law prohibits:


















	(1)






	trading by an insider, while in possession of material nonpublic information; or
















	(2)






	trading by a non-insider, while in possession of material nonpublic information, where the information either was disclosed to the non-insider in violation of an insider's duty to keep it confidential or was misappropriated; or







	(3)    communicating material nonpublic information to others.









	Who is an Insider?


	  The concept of "insider" is broad. It includes officers, directors, trustees and employees of a company. In addition, a person can be a "temporary insider" if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a company's affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the company's purposes. A temporary insider can include, among others, a company's attorneys, accountants, consultants, bank lending officers, and the employees of such organizations. In addition, Calvert may become a temporary insider of a company it advises or for which it performs other services.









	What is Material Information?


	  Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is material. "Material Information" generally is defined as information for which there is a substantial likelihood that a








	15






















	reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or her investment decisions, or information that is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a company's securities. Information that officers, directors, trustees and employees should consider material includes, but is not limited to: dividend changes, earnings estimates, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management developments.









	Material information also may relate to the


	market


	 for a company's securities. Information about a significant order to purchase or sell securities may, in some contexts, be deemed material. Similarly, prepublication information regarding reports in the financial press also may be deemed material.









	It is conceivable that similar advance reports of securities to be bought or sold by a large, influential institutional investor, such as a Fund, may be deemed material to an investment in those portfolio securities. Advance knowledge of important proposed government regulation, for example, could also be deemed material information regarding companies in the regulated industry.




	  




	What is Nonpublic Information?


	  Information is nonpublic until it has been disseminated broadly to investors in the market place. Tangible evidence of such dissemination is the best indication that the information is public. For example, information is public after it has become available to the general public through a public filing with the SEC or some other governmental agency, the Dow Jones "tape" or the Wall Street Journal or some other publication of general circulation, and after sufficient time has passed so that the information has been disseminated widely.









	C.    


	Penalties for Insider Trading









	Penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information are severe, both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers. A person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violation. Penalties include:


















	•






	civil injunctions;
















	•






	treble damages;
















	•






	disgorgement of profits;
















	•






	jail sentences;


















	•






	fines for the person who committed the violation of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, whether or not the person actually benefited; and
















	•






	fines for the employer or other controlling person of up to the greater of $1,000,000, or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided.












	16



























	In addition, any violation of this policy statement can be expected to result in serious sanctions by Calvert, up to and including dismissal of the persons involved.









	D.    


	Contacts with Public Companies









	For Calvert, contacts with public companies represent an important part of our research efforts. Calvert may make investment decisions on the basis of the firm's conclusions formed through such contacts and analysis of publicly available information. Difficult legal issues arise, however, when, in the course of these contacts, a Covered Person becomes aware of


	material


	, nonpublic information. This could happen, for example, if a company's chief financial officer prematurely discloses quarterly results to an analyst or an investor relation representative makes a selective disclosure of adverse news to a handful of investors. In such situation, Calvert must make a judgment as to its further conduct. For the protection of the company and its employees, the General Counsel should be contacted if an employee believes that he or she has received material, nonpublic information.









	E.    


	Tender Offers









	Tender offers represent a particular concern in the law of insider trading for two reasons. First, tender offer activity often produces extraordinary gyrations in the price of the target company's securities. Trading during this time period is more likely to attract regulatory attention (and produces a disproportionate percentage of insider trading cases). Second, the SEC has adopted a rule which expressly forbids trading and "tipping" while in possession of material, nonpublic information regarding a tender offer received from the tender offer or, the target company or anyone acting on behalf of either. Covered Persons should exercise particular caution any time they become aware of nonpublic information relating to a tender offer.









	X.    Notices




















	•






	Obligation to Report Violations


	: Any Access Person who has himself or herself, or who discovers that another Access Person has, violated or apparently violated any provision of this Code of Ethics must promptly report the matter to the CCO.





















	•






	The CCO Has The Authority To Review Records


	: The CCO or designee may also request additional information to complete his or her compliance review and oversight.

















	17

































	•






	Your Privacy


	: Is extremely important and will be held in the utmost confidence, but your reported information is subject to review and action by regulators, and by appropriate personnel such as the CCO-Advisor, CCO-Distributor, CCO-Funds, and certain other members of the Legal and/or Compliance Departments.













	XI.    Education









	Another aspect of Calvert's compliance procedures will be to keep Calvert Associates and other Access Persons informed. All Calvert Associates and other Access Persons will be trained on and be required to confirm their understanding and acknowledgment of the Code and other specified policies and procedures periodically.









	XII.    Discretionary Authority of CCO









	The CCO reserves the authority to waive any provision of this Code, for good cause shown, so long as such waiver is not contrary to the federal securities laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Additionally, the CCO reserves the authority to impose additional restrictions on any individual or group of individuals where necessary to uphold the general fiduciary principles of the Code.

	Dear [


	Name of 3



	rd



	 Party Adviser Individual


	],









	As you know, I am associated with Calvert Investments (“Calvert”). Calvert has adopted a Code of Ethics (“Code”) under which I am considered to be an “Access Person” of Calvert Investment Management, Inc., an investment adviser registered under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Adviser Act”), and required to make periodic reporting of my personal securities transactions and holdings in accounts where I have “direct or indirect influence or control” in the decision making with regards to the particular purchase or sale of securities. As required by Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, for accounts where I have no direct or indirect influence or control, Calvert requires that I make certain certifications and also obtain similar certification from the third party manager to those accounts.









	I have acknowledged and certified to Calvert that:

	change and will provide any required information regarding holdings and transactions in the Accounts pursuant to Calvert’s Code and Rule 204A-1; and













	3.






	I agree to provide reports of holdings and transactions made in the Accounts.

	AMENDED AND RESTATED




	BY-LAWS




	OF




	CALVERT VARIABLE PRODUCTS, INC.














	ARTICLE I




	ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND PRINCIPAL OFFICE









	Section 1. Articles of Incorporation


	. These By-laws are subject to the Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”), as from time-to-time in effect, of Calvert Variable Series, Inc. (the “Fund”) a corporation established under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland.











	Section 2. Principal Office of the Fund


	. The principal office of the Fund is located at 4550 Montgomery Avenue, Suite 1000N, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. The Fund may have offices in such other places within or outside the State of Maryland as the Directors may from time-to-time determine.









	ARTICLE II




	SHAREHOLDERS









	Section 1. Meetings


	. There shall be no annual meetings of Shareholders except as required by law. Meetings of the Shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the Fund in Maryland, or at such place within or outside the State of Maryland and on such dates and at such times as the Directors or their designee shall designate.









	Section 2. Special Meetings


	. A special meeting of the Shareholders of the Fund or of any Series or Class shall be held when called by the Secretary or his or her designee (a) whenever ordered by: (i) a majority of Directors then in office, (ii) the Chairperson or (iii) the President, or (b) whenever election of a Director or Directors by Shareholders is required by the provisions of Section 16(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.


	A special meeting of the Shareholders of the Fund or of any Series or Class shall also be called by the Secretary or his or her designee upon the order of the Directors upon the written request of the Shareholders holding Shares representing in the aggregate not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of the Outstanding Shares entitled to vote on the matters specified in such written request provided that: (1) such request shall state the purposes of such meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on, and (2) the Shareholders requesting such meeting shall have paid to the Fund the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing the notice thereof, which estimate the Secretary shall determine and specify to such Shareholders. If the Secretary fails for more than 30 days to call a special meeting, the Directors, the Chairperson or the President may, in the name of the Secretary, call the meeting by giving the required notice. If the special meeting is a meeting of Shareholders of any Series or Class, but not a meeting of all Shareholders of the Fund, then only a special meeting of Shareholders of such Series or Class need be called and, in such case, only Shareholders of such Series or Class shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.


	 The business transacted at any special meeting of Shareholders shall be limited to the purpose stated in the notice of such special meeting. Unless requested by Shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, a special meeting need not be called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting of the Shareholders held during the preceding twelve (12) months, upon the vote or consent of a majority of the Board of Directors.











	Section 3. Record Dates


	. For the purpose of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders, or for the purpose of determining Shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or in order to make a determination of Shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any other such determination of Shareholders. Such date shall not be more than ninety (90) days, nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting or the date of the particular action to be taken. When a determination of Shareholders of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any adjourned meeting unless the Directors fix a new record date for such adjourned meeting. Only Shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting, or any adjourned meeting, or to receive payments of such dividend or distribution, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any Shares on the books of the Fund after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. In lieu of fixing such date, the Directors may for any such purposes close the register or transfer books for all or any part of such period, as may be permitted by law, regulation or the Articles.









	Section 4. Notice of Meetings


	. Notice of all meetings of Shareholders and any postponements thereof, stating the time, place and purposes of the meeting, shall be given by the Secretary or the Directors in accordance with Article II, Section 10 hereof at least ten (10) days and not more than ninety (90) days before the date for the meeting set forth in such notice, to each Shareholder of record of the applicable Series or Class on the date set in accordance with Article II, Section 3 hereof. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice, provided the date of such adjourned meeting is not more than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the original record date. Where separate meetings are held for Shareholders of the individual Series or Class to vote on a matter required to be voted on by Shareholders of the Fund in the aggregate, notice of each such separate meeting shall be provided in the manner described in this Section.









	Section 5. Quorum


	. The holders of Outstanding Shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy representing one-third of the voting power of the Fund shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Shareholders, except that where pursuant to any provision of law, the Articles or these By-laws a vote shall be taken by individual Series or Class, then Outstanding Shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy representing one-third of the voting power of that Series or Class shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that Series or Class. For the purposes of establishing whether a quorum is present, all Shares present and entitled to vote, including abstentions and broker non-votes, shall be counted. At any meeting of Shareholders at which a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the Shares represented at the meeting shall be the act of the Shareholders, unless the vote of a greater or lesser number of Shares is required by law, regulation or the Articles. At any meeting of Shareholders at which a quorum is not present, the Shareholders present or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time-to-time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a quorum is present. Unless a proxy is limited in this regard, any Shares present and entitled to vote at a meeting that are represented by broker non-votes, may, at the discretion of the proxies named therein, be voted in favor of such an adjournment. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted that may have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.











	Section 6. Proxies


	. At any meeting of Shareholders, any holder of Shares entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Secretary, or with such other officer or agent of the Fund as the Directors or officers may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. In connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Directors, a Shareholder may give instructions through hardcopy delivered by U.S. mail or similar means, through telephonic or electronic methods of communication or via the Internet for another person to execute his or her proxy, if in each case such method has been authorized by the Fund through its officers, and pursuant in each case to procedures established or approved by the officers of the Fund or agents employed by the Fund for such purpose as reasonably designed to verify that such instructions have been authorized by such Shareholder; and the placing of a Shareholder’s name on a proxy pursuant to such instructions shall constitute execution of such proxy by or on behalf of such Shareholder. Proxies may also be submitted via facsimile if such method has been authorized by the Fund through its officers, and pursuant to procedures established or approved by the officers of the Fund or agents employed by the Fund for such purpose. Pursuant to a vote of the Directors, proxies may be solicited in the name of one or more Directors and/or one or more of the officers of the Fund. When any Share is held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Share, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Share, but shall be counted as present at the meeting for all other purposes. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. If the holder of any such Share is a minor or a person of unsound mind, and subject to guardianship or to the legal control of any other person as regards the charge or management of such Share, such Share may be voted by such guardian or such other person appointed or having such control, and such vote may be given in person or by proxy. Unless otherwise specifically limited by their terms, proxies shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any postponement or adjournment of a meeting, and no proxy shall be valid after eleven months from its date. A Shareholder who has submitted a proxy may revoke or withdraw the proxy with respect to any matter to be considered at a meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof if such revocation or withdrawal is properly received prior to the vote on that matter, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting or the adjournment or postponement thereof and voting in person on the matter or matters.











	Section 7. Voting


	. Each outstanding Share, regardless of the Series designation, is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of Shareholders and shall have a fractional vote for each fraction of a Share held. Within each Series, each Share shall have equal voting rights with each other. However, in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in some instances, the vote of a majority of the Outstanding Shares of any Series on matters affecting such Series shall be effective for that Series, notwithstanding that the matter does not receive a majority of the Outstanding Shares of any other Series or a majority of the Outstanding Shares of the Fund. On any matter submitted to a vote of the Shareholders, all Shares of all Series and Classes then entitled to vote shall be voted together, except that (i) when required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 to be voted by individual Series or Class, Shares shall be voted by individual Series or Class, and (ii) when the Directors have determined that the matter affects only the interests of Shareholders of one or more Series or Classes, only Shareholders of such one or more Series or Classes shall be entitled to vote thereon. The Shares of each Series shall have non-cumulative voting rights. A Shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the Shareholder or by such Shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact in accordance with Section 6 of this Article.









	Section 8. Conduct of Meetings


	. For any matter to be properly before any meeting of Shareholders, the matter must be either specified in the notice of meeting given by or at the direction of a majority of the Directors then in office or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Chairperson or other presiding officer. With the exception of Shareholder proposals submitted in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor provisions, only matters proposed by the Directors may be included in the Fund’s proxy materials. The Directors may from time-to-time in their discretion provide for procedures by which Shareholders may, prior to any meeting at which Directors are to be elected, submit the names of potential candidates for Director, to be considered by the Directors, or any proper committee thereof. At all meetings of Shareholders, unless voting is conducted by inspectors pursuant to Article II, Section 9, all questions relating to the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided by the Chairperson or other presiding officer.









	Section 9. Inspectors of Election


	. In advance of any meeting of Shareholders, the Directors, or at any such meeting, the Directors or the Chairperson or other presiding officer, may appoint Inspectors of Election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairperson or other presiding officer may appoint a person to fill the vacancy. Unless otherwise instructed by the Directors, or by the Chairperson or other presiding officer at the meeting, the Inspectors of Election shall determine the number of Shares outstanding, the Shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, shall receive votes, ballots or consents, shall hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote, shall count and tabulate all votes and consents, determine the results, and do such other acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote.









	Section 10. Communications with Shareholders


	. Any notices, reports, statements or other communications with Shareholders of any kind required under the Articles, these By-laws or applicable law may be sent, delivered or made available in any reasonable manner as may be determined by the Directors if not otherwise prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation, by email or other electronic means or by posting on a website; and such communications may be sent, delivered or otherwise made available to Shareholders in accordance with householding or other similar rules under which a single copy of such notice or report may be sent to Shareholders who reside at the same address. No communication need be given to any Shareholder who shall have failed to inform the Fund of the Shareholder’s current address and the Directors may from time-to-time adopt, or may authorize the officers or agents of the Fund to adopt, procedures or policies with respect to communications to Shareholders that are returned to the Fund or its agents as undeliverable and similar matters. Any Shareholder may waive receipt of any notice or other communication. Communications shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or deposited in the mail or with another carrier or sent by any means of written or electronic communication or, where notice is given by posting on a website or by publication, on the date of posting or publication. An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any meeting of Shareholders shall be filed and maintained with the records of the Fund.









	Section 11. Action by Written Consent


	. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Shareholders may be taken, if so directed by the Directors, without a meeting by written action executed by Shareholders, as of a record date specified by the Directors, holding not less than the minimum voting power that would have been necessary to take the action at a meeting, assuming that all of the Shareholders entitled to vote on that action were present and voting at that meeting. The written action shall be effective when it has been executed by the requisite number of Shareholders and delivered to the Secretary of the Fund, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. Such a consent may be executed and delivered by electronic means in accordance with any procedures that may be adopted by the Directors from time-to-time.









	Section 12. Access to Books and Records


	. The records, accounts and books of the Fund shall be open to inspection by Shareholders to the extent required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland.









	ARTICLE III




	DIRECTORS











	Section 1. Number, Term of Office, and Eligibility


	. The number of Directors shall be determined from time-to-time by vote of a majority of the Directors; provided however, that at no time shall the number of Directors be less than three (3) nor more than twelve (12). The Directors need not be residents of Maryland nor Shareholders of the Fund. Directors, other than the Directors of the first Board of Directors, shall be elected at a meeting of the Shareholders, except as may otherwise be provided in these By-laws or the Articles, to serve until their successors shall have been elected and qualified.




	    






	Section 2. Chairperson of the Board


	. The Directors may elect from their own number a Chairperson to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or disqualification. The Chairperson of the Board or his or her designee shall preside at all regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors. The Chairperson shall also perform such other duties and have such other powers as may from time-to-time be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors.











	Section 3. Regular Meetings


	. Regular meetings of the Directors may be held without call or notice at such places as the Directors may from time-to-time determine, provided that notice of the first regular meeting following any such determination will be given to absent Directors. Such meetings may also be held by means of conference telephone circuit, video conferencing or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time, and such means will constitute presence in person at a meeting to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.











	Section 4. Special Meetings


	. Special meetings of the Directors may be held at any time and at any place designated in the call and notice of the meeting when called by the Chairperson, the President or the Secretary or by two or more Directors, sufficient notice thereof as described in Article III, Section 5 below being given to each Director by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or by the person calling the meeting. Such meetings may also be held by means of conference telephone circuit, video conferencing or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time, and such means will constitute presence in person at a meeting to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.

It shall be sufficient notice to a Director of a special meeting to send notice by overnight mail at least two days, or by email or facsimile at least one day, before the meeting, addressed to the Director at his or her usual or last known business or residence address, email address or facsimile number, as applicable, or to give notice in person or by telephone one day before the meeting. Notice may be sent on the day of the special meeting by email, facsimile or other electronic means, or given by telephone or in person, if under the circumstances, the party calling the meeting deems more immediate action to be necessary or appropriate. Notice of a special meeting need not be given to any Director if a written waiver of notice, executed by him or her before or after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Director who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at its commencement the lack of notice to him or her. Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purpose(s) of the meeting. When all the Directors are present at a special meeting, however called, or for whatever purpose held, or assent to the holding of the meeting without notice, or, after the meeting, sign a written assent thereto on the record of such meeting, the acts of such meeting will be valid as if the meeting had been properly called and noticed.











	Section 6. Quorum and Vote


	. A majority of the Directors shall be present in person at any regular or special meeting of the Directors in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting and (except as otherwise required by law, the or these By-Laws) the act of a majority of the Directors present at any meeting at which the quorum is present shall be the act of the Directors. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time-to-time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. A meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal from the meeting of one or more Directors if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum.











	Section 7. Action Without A Meeting


	. Whenever Directors are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, such action may be taken by the Board of Directors without a meeting on the written consent of all of the members of the Board of Directors, provided such meeting is not required to be held in person by the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other applicable law, and such consent shall be filed in the minute Book of the Secretary. Such action shall have the same force and effect as an in-person action of the Board of Directors.











	Section 8. Powers and Duties


	. The Directors shall have exclusive and absolute control over the Fund Property and over the business of the Fund but with full powers of delegation, except as may otherwise be expressly prohibited by law, the Articles or otherwise by these By-laws.

	. Subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a vacancy on the Board of Directors for any reason may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors (though the number of Directors may be less than a quorum), and such Director shall serve until such Director's successor shall have been qualified and elected.









	Section 12. Counsel and Experts


	. The Directors who are not Interested Persons may, by vote of a majority of such Directors, at the Fund’s expense, hire such employees and retain such counsel, accountants, appraisers or other experts or consultants whose services such Directors may, in their discretion, determine to be necessary or desirable from time-to-time, including services to one or more committees established by the Directors, and may execute any agreements, contracts, instruments or other documents in connection therewith.

Transfers of Shares of the Fund shall be made only on the books of the Fund, as maintained by the Transfer Agent with respect to such Shares, by the registered holder thereof, or by an attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Transfer Agent for such Shares and upon surrender of any certificate or certificates representing such Shares, if any, properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon. Except as may be otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, the person in whose name Shares stand on the books of the Fund shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Fund; provided, that properly documented pledges of Shares as collateral security may be accounted for by the Transfer Agent in accordance with its standard procedures with respect thereto.

If so directed by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares of the Fund, the custodian will deliver and pay over all property of the Fund held by it as specified in such vote.

	. Shares of each Series and Class shall be redeemed at their net asset value determined as set forth in Article VIII, Section 6 below as of such time as the Directors shall have theretofore prescribed, less any fees and/or charges as may be established by the Directors from time-to-time, as disclosed in the applicable Prospectus.

	. The per Share net asset value of the Shares of the Fund or any Series or Class thereof shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the net assets of such Series or Class (being the value of the assets belonging to that Series or Class less the liabilities belonging to that Series or Class, respectively) by the total number of Shares of that Series or Class outstanding.

The Fund may suspend the determination of net asset value during any period when it may suspend the right of Shareholders to require the Fund to redeem Shares.









	ARTICLE IX




	BONDING AND INDEMNIFICATION











	Section 1. Bonding


	. The President, any Vice Presidents, the Secretary and the Treasurer shall be bonded for the faithful performance of their respective duties, with sufficient sureties and in such amounts as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also require a bond of any other officer or employee of the Fund with such surety as it may deem proper. Such bond shall be approved at least annually by the Board.











	Section 2. Indemnification; Authority of Directors


	. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the Directors may, by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding giving rise to the claim for indemnification, indemnify or advance any expenses to Directors, Officers and to any other person to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland.











	Section 3. Indemnification; Proceeding Not Brought By or on Behalf of Fund


	. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Article, the Fund shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action brought by or on behalf of the Fund) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Fund, or is or was serving at the request of the Fund as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Fund, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, creates a rebuttable presumption that the Director did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in the subsection.











	Section 4. Proceeding Brought by or on Behalf of Fund


	. Subject to provisions of Section 6 of this Article, the Fund shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit brought by or on behalf of the Fund to obtain a judgment or decree on its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Fund, or is or was serving at the request of the Fund as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Fund. However, no indemnification shall be provided in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged liable for negligence or misconduct in performing his or her duty to the Fund, except to the extent that the court in which the action, suit or proceeding was brought or any other court in which the action, suit or proceeding was brought or any other court of equity in the county in which the Fund has its principal office, determines on application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for those expenses which the court shall deem proper. However, indemnification with respect to any proceeding by or in the right of the Fund or in which liability shall have been adjudged against a Director in an action, suit or proceeding charging improper personal benefit to the Director whether or not involving action in the Director’s official capacity on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received shall be limited to expenses.











	Section 5. Indemnification for Successful Defense


	. To the extent that a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Fund successfully defends on the merits or otherwise any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 3 and 4 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter raised in the proceeding, the Fund shall indemnify him or her against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.











	Section 6. Authorization


	. Any indemnification under Sections 3 and 4 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Fund only as authorized in the specific case after determination that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections 3 and 4. Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if the required quorum is not obtained, then by a majority vote of a committee of the board consisting solely of two or more Directors not, at the time, parties to such proceeding and who were duly designated to act in the matter by a majority vote of the full Board in which the designated Directors who are parties may participate, or (c) by a special counsel selected by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board by vote as set forth in subpart (a) of this Section, or, if the requisite quorum of the full Board cannot be obtained therefor, and the committee cannot be established, by a majority vote of the full Board in which Directors who are parties may participate; or (d) by the Shareholders of the Fund. Shares held by Directors who are parties to the proceeding may not be voted on the subject matter under this Article.











	Section 7. Advance Reimbursement


	. Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Fund before the final disposition thereof if authorized in the specific case by a preliminary determination following one of the procedures set forth in Section 6 of this Article that there is a reasonable basis for a belief that the Director, officer, employee or agent met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 3 and 4 of this Article, and upon receipt by the Fund of (a) written affirmation by the Director of the Director's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund as authorized in this Article has been met; and (b) an undertaking is given to the Fund by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent reasonably assuring that the advance will be repaid if it is not ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Fund as authorized in this Article.











	Section 8. Non-Exclusive Rights


	. The indemnification provided by this Article continues as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of his or her heirs and personal representative, and does not exclude any other rights to which a defendant or other person may be entitled under any By-Laws, agreement, vote of Shareholders or Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or otherwise both as to (a) action in his or her official capacity, and (b) action in another capacity while holding the office.











	Section 9. Insurance


	. The Fund may, upon resolution of a majority of the Fund's Board of Directors, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Fund, or who is or was serving at the request of the Fund as a director, officer, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan against any liability asserted against him or her or incurred by him or her, or arising out of his or her position, whether or not the Fund would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX.











	Section 10. Report of Indemnification to Shareholders.


	 Any indemnification of, or advance of expenses to, a Director in accordance with this Article, if arising out of a proceeding by or in the right of the Fund, shall be reported in writing to the Shareholders with the notice of the next Shareholder's meeting or prior to the meeting.











	Section 11. Limitations Imposed By the Investment Company Act of 1940.


	 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, nothing in this Article protects or purports to protect any Director or officer of the Fund against any liability to the Fund or its security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office.









	ARTICLE X

	Section 2. Seal


	.


	The Directors may adopt a seal of the Fund which shall be in such form and shall have such inscription thereon as the Directors may from time-to-time prescribe, but unless otherwise required by the Directors, the seal shall not be necessary to be placed on, and its absence shall not impair the validity of, any document, instrument or other paper executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Fund.











	Section 3. Books and Records


	. The books and records of the Fund and any Series or Classes thereof, including the Share ledger or ledgers, may be kept in or outside the State of Maryland at such office or offices of the Fund and/or its agents as may from time-to-time be determined by the officers of the Fund.









	Section 4. Execution of Papers


	.


	All deeds, leases, contracts, notes and other obligations made by the Directors shall be signed by the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, the Secretary, or any Assistant Secretary, or by any other officer if such officer has been elected by the Directors, except as the Directors may generally or in particular cases authorize the execution thereof in some other manner, or as otherwise provided in these By-laws.









	Section 5. Severability


	. The provisions of these By-laws are severable. If the Directors determine, with the advice of counsel, that any provision hereof conflicts with the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other applicable laws and regulations, the conflicting provision shall be deemed never to have constituted a part of these By-laws; provided, however, that such determination shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of these By-laws or render invalid or improper any action taken or omitted prior to such determination. If any provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision only in such jurisdiction and shall not affect any other provision of these By-laws.









	Section 6. Headings


	. Headings are placed in these By-laws for convenience of reference only and in case of any conflict, the text of these By-laws rather than the headings shall control.

Calvert actively exercises proxy voting seeking to advance the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies held in our investment portfolios. We take this responsibility very seriously and are transparent about how and what we vote.
Shareholders of a corporation not only have the right to participate in the financial growth and success of their corporation, they also have the right to vote on important matters concerning the company's policies, practices and governance.
Calvert believes that proxy voting is the most direct means by which investors can influence corporate behavior. Calvert casts votes on a company's shareholder resolutions based on its proxy voting guidelines.
Download Proxy Voting Guidelines
We believe all of our clients have a right to know how we are voting company proxies on their behalf; therefore, recent proxy voting decisions for each of the funds we manage are disclosed. Proxy voting guidelines and reporting for other advisory clients will be governed by the terms of the respective advisory agreement.
