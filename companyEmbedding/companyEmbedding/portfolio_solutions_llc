 The True Value of a Financial Advisor 

    Gary Brancaleone  
 November 29, 2016 
 Financial advisors don’t work for free, but their true value can far exceed the fees they charge when investors select them wisely.  An advisor’s experience and expertise may actually help you make more money in the long run compared to self-managing your portfolio and other aspects of your personal finances.
KEEP YOU ON TRACK THROUGH PERIODS OF MARKET VOLATILITY
A financial advisor can keep you on track throughout all market conditions, which is especially important during periods of market volatility. Investing is emotional. Bull markets... Read More »  

 Now is the Time for Young People to Consider a Wealth Planning Career  

    Mike Nemick  
 October 03, 2016 
 There has never been a better time for young people to enter the wealth planning and related financial services industry. The United States currently has a huge need for financial advisors, and there are a number of opportunities available across multiple career paths.  Best of all, this is a great field for people who want to make a positive difference in others’ lives.
As a society, many people in the U.S. are distressingly illiterate when it comes to their finances.  The U.S. stands in 14th place out of 148 countries in financial literacy according to... Read More »  

 The Roth IRA Tool Chest Series: The Roth "Emergency Bin" 

    Portfolio Solutions®  
 September 15, 2016 
 The Roth IRA is most often viewed as a retirement tool. That makes sense, since “IRA” stands for Individual Retirement Account. Just because it is called a retirement account, however, doesn’t mean it can’t be used in other ways. In fact, there are features built into the Roth IRA that make it perfect for many other uses. This article is the first of a series that will discuss many efficient, creative and often overlooked ideas related to the Roth IRA.
The first Roth IRA tool we will discuss is something I call the “emergency fund storage bin.” For many people, especially younger... Read More »  

 Health Care Power of Attorney for Young Adults 

    Portfolio Solutions®  
 August 24, 2016 
 There’s a lot to consider when your child turns 18, isn’t there? You’ve contributed to their 529 plan for years, the car is packed, and your child is ready to head off to college. On top of that, they can vote and enlist in the military - it’s quite a list. Perhaps the most mind-boggling thing as a parent is to realize your child is an adult – maybe not in your eyes, but they definitely are in the eyes of the law. 
It’s important to take your child’s legal adult status into account, because as an adult, their information is considered private, even from their... Read More »  

 How Your Financial Experiences Can Benefit Your Children & Grandchildren

 Roth Conversions: To Convert or Not to Convert Your Traditional IRA 

    Portfolio Solutions®  
 August 05, 2016 
 The discussion of whether to convert your IRA to a Roth IRA evokes a wide range of opinions regarding if, when, and how you should convert the assets in your account. Some advisors believe you should always convert all your Traditional IRA (also called a Contributory IRA) assets to a Roth, while others feel you should never convert. The truth lies somewhere in between.
It’s important to understand the different tax treatment of IRAs. A Traditional IRA is funded by making contributions, and if you qualify under IRS rules, you can deduct your contribution from your taxable income. You... Read More »

You are hereHomeLatest LearningsInvestment 101Rebalancing Explained 

Rebalancing Explained




A portfolio should not be invested in an asset allocation strategy and then forgotten. Your portfolio must be rebalanced to keep the asset classes aligned with your long-term asset allocation strategy. Rebalancing can reduce risk, invest cash effectively and keep a portfolio on track. A disciplined rebalancing program also eliminates subjective and emotional decision making that can throw a portfolio far off an investor’s desired level of risk.
An ongoing rebalancing program is rigorously applied at Portfolio Solutions®. We review all portfolios continuously and single out client portfolios where asset classes are off the target allocation by a pre-determined amount. As an example, assume a portfolio is being managed to a 50 percent stock and 50 percent bond allocation. It will be a candidate for rebalancing if the stock or bond portion grows to 55 percent or falls to 45 percent. 
Portfolio rebalancing is not automatic. Although our computer programs isolate client portfolios that need review, each review is individually conducted by our highly trained portfolio management staff that makes the ultimate rebalancing decisions.
There are reasons a portfolio may not be rebalanced at the time it is identified. Expected cash flows and trading cost minimization play important roles in rebalancing decisions.
Rebalancing will sometimes occur when a contribution of cash and/or securities is made to an account or a cash withdrawal is requested by a client. It is important for clients to communicate with us when there will be a cash withdrawal from an account so that we may raise the cash in a proper time period. Many clients are on an automatic withdrawal program and those clients do not need to contact us at each withdrawal period.
Dividend and interest income may also be used for rebalancing. This income initially flows into a money market fund where it is either invested where needed or distributed out periodically as part of an automatic withdrawal program.

WE DO: SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS. 











 


The root of investment success is a sound philosophy which forms the foundation for creating a custom strategy and developing the discipline to stick with it. Our philosophy is that the global financial markets provide good returns, and attempts to beat the markets results mostly in lower returns. High fees and poor investment selection create barriers to success, and tax costs can be a major detriment to return.  We strive to recognize, address and mitigate all these costs at Portfolio Solutions®.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
