The Board of HSBC Global Asset Management, chaired by an independent non-executive director, endorses the annual operating plan and receives reports from HSBC Global Asset Management’s Risk Management Committee.
The Global Executive Committee provides business oversight, monitoring and stewardship for the business and drives business development, sales and distribution, giving due consideration to local board and corporate management requirements.

Our Approach

As the asset management division of HSBC, our approach reflects HSBC’s values to be:Dependable and do the right thing, open to different ideas and cultures and connected to customers, communities, regulators and each other.










The world is changing rapidly, but some things endure


These values describe how we interact with each other, with our clients, regulators and the wider community.
The HSBC values shape our approach to investment business which is characterised by four key beliefs.



We believe:

In connecting clients with opportunities  - we are in the markets that matter most to our clients, both developed and faster growing and share expertise and thinking across all our markets 
In doing the right thing for our clients  - we don't believe in taking undue risks with our client’s money and try to make costs and processes as transparent as possible
In long and successful client relationships - we seek to provide investment solutions that meet our client’s long-term needs and follow a disciplined investment process
Being part of the HSBC Group brings strengths that benefit our clients  - we share HSBCs culture and attitude to risk and strong insight into client needs through on-the-ground presence 


These beliefs are further supported by an investment philosophy which demonstrates clarity and focus, discipline and application and high standards of investment governance, integrity and longevity of client relationships.
A cornerstone of HSBC Global Asset Management’s strategy is a focus on corporate governance to ensure that we fulfil our fiduciary responsibilities to clients.  The aim of focusing on governance in everything we do is to ensure that we are responsibly fulfilling the trust that our clients are placing in us.  The interests and indeed ultimate success of our clients is integral to our business strategy and governance approach.

About us
HSBC Global Asset Management is a major global asset management firm managing assets totalling USD 430.1 billion at the end of 30 June 2016 with well-established businesses in Europe, the Asia-Pacific regional, North America, Latin America and the Middle East.
We believe that HSBC Global Asset Management is well placed to provide a globally-consistent, disciplined, investment process across our capabilities, which draws on the local knowledge and expertise of our team of over 500 investment professionals and over 2,200 employees based in nearly 26 locations around the world.

Governance structure

Our focus on governance and placing our clients' interests first.







A cornerstone of HSBC Global Asset Management’s strategy is a focus on governance to ensure that we fulfil our fiduciary responsibilities to clients.  The aim of focusing on governance in everything we do is to ensure that we are responsibly fulfilling the trust that our clients are placing in us.  The interests and indeed ultimate success of our clients is integral to our business strategy and governance approach.  As a result, the beliefs we adhere to, and which are core to our culture, include: 

We don’t believe in taking undue risks with our clients' money
When necessary we close funds to new inflows in an effort to protect existing investors and say 'no' to business we believe is not in the interests of our existing clients
We try to make our costs and processes as transparent as possible
We champion our clients' interests when engaging with regulators

Key takeaways   





We remain neutral global equities and corporate bonds, and underweight developed market (DM) government bonds. We also continue to be overweight local currency emerging market (EM) government bonds and EM equities
Global equities were little changed in June, supported by data showing robust economic activity which helped offset concerns over a tightening of global monetary policy
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the fed funds target rate by 25bps at its June meeting, also signalling it would begin unwinding its balancing sheet later this year
The European Central Bank (ECB) reflected a more positive economic outlook at its June meeting, with the reference to taking rates “lower if needed” dropped from its statement
Despite signs of a slowing UK economy, the June Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting saw three MPC members vote for a rate increase
In China, authorities continue to tighten financial and property policies. However, activity growth should remain resilient in the near term





Global central banks gradually move to a tighter policy stance   




Although the acceleration in global economic activity since the summer of 2016 has slowed slightly, overall conditions remain on a solid footing. This positive cyclical backdrop has seen the Fed continue along its tightening cycle, and the ECB and BoE both strike a more hawkish tone at their June meetings. Nevertheless, we also recognise that inflation trends remain subdued. Not only should this translate to a very gradual normalisation of policy, but also support consumer spending. In this context, and given relative valuations, we continue to favour global equities over DM government bonds, with a preference for Japan, eurozone and EM equities over the US.
For US Treasuries, we now measure a negative implied term premium (i.e. we are being penalised for bearing duration risk). Given upside risks to US inflation in the context of a tightening labour market, this reinforces our underweight positioning in this asset class, along with other DM government bond markets. Elsewhere, the current market-implied odds for taking credit risk is still not particularly attractive, and we maintain a neutral stance amid stable fundamentals. Finally, we remain overweight in EM local currency debt and equities, although the investment case for the latter is driven by economic and price momentum and cheap currencies rather than anomalous valuations.

Basis of Views and Definitions of ‘Long term Asset class positioning’ tables   




Views are based on regional HSBC Global Asset Management Asset Allocation meetings held throughout June 2017, HSBC Global Asset Management’s long-term expected return forecasts which were generated as at 31  May 2017, our portfolio optimisation process and actual portfolio positions.
Icons:

 View on this asset class has been upgraded

 No change

 View on this asset class has been downgraded
Underweight, overweight and neutral classifications are the high-level asset allocations tilts applied in diversified, typically multi-asset portfolios, which reflect a combination of our long-term valuation signals, our shorter-term cyclical views and actual positioning in portfolios. The views are expressed with reference to global portfolios. However, individual portfolio positions may vary according to mandate, benchmark, risk profile and the availability and riskiness of individual asset classes in different regions. 
“Overweight”  implies that, within the context of a well-diversified typically multi-asset portfolio, and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks, HSBC Global Asset Management has (or would have) a positive tilt towards the asset class.
“Underweight”  implies that, within the context of a well-diversified typically multi-asset portfolio, and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks, HSBC Global Asset Management has (or would) have a negative tilt towards the asset class.
“Neutral”  implies that, within the context of a well-diversified typically multi-asset portfolio, and relative to relevant internal or external benchmarks HSBC Global Asset Management has (or would have) neither a particularly negative or positive tilt towards the asset class 
For global investment-grade corporate bonds, the underweight, overweight and neutral categories for the asset class at the aggregate level are also based on high-level asset allocation considerations applied in diversified, typically multi-asset portfolios. However, USD investment-grade corporate bonds and EUR and GBP investment-grade corporate bonds are determined relative to the global investment-grade corporate bond universe.




Long term asset  class positioning (>12 months)   








Asset class
View
Movement
Rationale


Equities


Global
Neutral


Positive factors:  Global economic growth momentum remains solid, driving global equity markets to deliver positive returns over the long term. Overall, support from still loose accommodative monetary policy and an increased willingness for looser fiscal policy will, in the medium and longer term, likely outweigh any headwinds from more modest Chinese growth, tighter US and eurozone monetary policy, and political uncertainty in many regions.

Risks to consider: Fairly  narrow implied equity premia (excess return over bonds) limits the ability of  the market to absorb bad news. Episodic volatility may be triggered by concerns  surrounding Chinese growth, US economic policy, and/or a potentially more rapid  than expected Fed tightening cycle, coupled with political risks. A notable and  persistent deterioration of the global economic outlook could also dampen our  view.


US
Neutral



Positive factors: US profits data has shown improvement amid a broadly robust economic backdrop. Corporate tax reform, looser regulation and fiscal stimulus under the Trump administration present an upside risk to earnings. Overall, our measure of the implied risk premium (excess returns over government bonds) remains consistent with a neutral positioning.
            

Risks to consider: Relatively high current valuations lead to an implied risk premium that is lower than in many other developed markets. The policy outlook under the Trump administration remains highly uncertain. More recently we have seen slight softness in US whole economy profits.
            


UK
Neutral



Positive factors:  Positive global economic momentum (and the potential for further sterling weakness) supports the UK earnings outlook given a large dependency on foreign earnings. Gains in commodity prices would also be a positive. Overall, current valuations are consistent with a neutral positioning, in our view.
            

Risks to consider:  The prospective reward to bearing equity risk in the UK is relatively low compared to other markets. The UK economy could slow amid sterling-induced inflationary pressures and Brexit-related uncertainty.
            


Eurozone
Overweight


Rationale of overweight views: We  favour eurozone equities due to their higher implied risk premia and scope for  better earnings news given the region’s earlier point in the activity cycle.  Furthermore, the monetary backdrop remains supportive, with ultra-low interest  rates likely to persist until the end of the decade.

Risks to consider: Valuations  have become less attractive following the recent rally. According to recent  polls, the upcoming Italian elections should see the eurosceptic 5-star  movement perform well. Also, the outcome of Brexit negotiations is highly  uncertain. Brexit-related trade disruptions and/or slower UK GDP growth will  likely hit eurozone exports. ECB monetary policy may also be less accommodative  than expected.


Japan
Overweight


Rationale of overweight views: Relative valuations and risk premia are attractive, in our view, whilst the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) extremely loose monetary policy and the government’s recent fiscal stimulus package may boost earnings. Large corporate cash reserves provide Japanese firms with the scope to boost dividends or engage in stock repurchases. Earnings momentum is showing signs of picking up.

Risks to consider: Domestic  economic fundamentals are relatively sluggish, with an absence of momentum in wage  growth, despite tight labour market conditions. 


Emerging Markets
            

            (EM)
Overweight


Rationale of overweight views: We believe EM equities remain attractive for western-based investors (USD, GBP or EUR based) given our expectation of longer-term currency appreciation. However, we continue to be selective, focusing on countries with strong underlying macro fundamentals, and positive price momentum. 

Risks to consider: Aggregate  EM equity valuations no longer look anomalously cheap. There could be some near-term volatility as worries persist around  the uncertain path for future Fed tightening, the potential for increased trade  protectionism, economic transition in China, and the robustness of the global  economy as a whole. Geopolitical uncertainty also poses risks.


Asia ex Japan
Overweight


Rationale of overweight views: Improving  earnings and profitability and more efficient use of cash levels on balance  sheets support rising return on equity, amid an export recovery, better  domestic growth, and supportive global and regional monetary policy. Structural  reforms and shareholder-return policies are potential catalysts in some  markets. Valuations look reasonable.

Risks to consider: A  sharp rise in US Treasury yields is a key risk. Fed balance sheet reduction and  ECB tapering could raise uncertainty. US protectionist policies remain a major  risk. Other risks include geopolitical events; commodity-price volatility; a fragile  or faltering global growth recovery; and renewed concerns about China’s growth  and financial risks.


CEE & Latam
Neutral


Positive factors: Brazil exited recession in Q1 and is embarking on an ambitious reform agenda, whilst Mexico’s economy is resilient. Poland has low levels of US dollar-denominated debt, and along with Russia and Hungary offers attractive risk premia, in our view. 

Risks to consider: Geopolitical  tensions are also high and unpredictable. High local cash rates and sovereign  yields in many countries diminish the case for bearing equity risk. 


Government bonds


Developed
            

            Markets (DM)
Underweight 


Rationale of underweight views: Prospective returns still look low relative to competing asset classes. In a bond-unfriendly environment (strong global activity, the prospect of fiscal easing), global bond yields could move higher still.

Positive factors: Government bonds still provide diversification benefits and reduce volatility within multi-asset portfolios. Meanwhile, “secular stagnation” forces are powerful (ageing populations, low productivity and investment), and the global pool of safety assets is limited. Therefore, the “normalisation” of bond yields could take several years.


US 
Underweight 


Rationale of underweight views: The US labour market is at (or close to) full employment so underlying inflationary pressures are likely to build, especially if fiscal stimulus materialises. In addition, prospective returns still look low relative to competing asset classes..

Positive factors: Today’s environment of “price stability” means that the term premia (compensation for bearing duration risk) may be capped at a lower level relative to history.


UK 
Underweight 


Rationale of underweight views: Prospective UK gilt returns remain very low. Although the UK economy could slow, any support in this respect may be offset by inflationary pressures.

Positive factors: Amid downside risks to growth, UK monetary policy is likely to stay accommodative for a longer period.


Eurozone 
Underweight 


Rationale of underweight views: Similarly,  core European bonds are overvalued, in our view. A key risk is the likelihood  of further tapering of the ECB APP after December 2017.

Positive factors: Core inflationary pressures in the region remain subdued, which should keep accommodative monetary policy in place for an extended period of time.


Japan 
Underweight 


Rationale of underweight views: Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are overvalued, in our view, whilst the BoJ’s commitment to peg 10-year yields close to zero could be re-evaluated. The BoJ has also recently reduced the amount of its JGB purchases.

Positive factors: The “Yield Curve Control” framework should limit volatility and reduce the risk of higher yields in the near-term. Meanwhile, BoJ Governor Kuroda has indicated that cutting policy rates could play a central role in future policy decisions.


Emerging markets (EM)
Overweight


Rationale of overweight views: The  yield available on EM sovereign bonds makes them attractive relative to DM  government debt, in our view. Furthermore, our estimate of the sustainable  return on EM currencies reinforces our choice to hold this position unhedged.

Risks to consider: Spreads in the EM debt universe are at risk of widening as US policy tightens. 


Corporate bonds


Global investment grade (IG)
Neutral


Positive factors: The prevailing macro environment remains supportive for credits. Implied recession probabilities are near zero – the default outlook appears benign.

Risks to consider: Valuations do not appear anomalously cheap, with low implied credit premia meaning that the margin of safety is now very thin against any negative shocks (such as tighter than expected US monetary policy).


USD investment grade
Neutral


Positive factors: US investment grade debt looks more attractive relative to European credit. Carefully-selected US credit may outperform.

Risks to consider: Lower relative valuations for USD-denominated credit is offset in the nearer term by the risk of a more aggressive pace of Fed tightening. The US credit cycle is more mature than that in Europe which remains nascent.


EUR and GBP investment grade
Neutral


Positive factors: The ECB’s corporate bond-buying programme remains supportive. Meanwhile, in the eurozone, the latest survey data suggests a gradual improvement in credit conditions, and default rates remain low. Valuations are still around neutral levels.

Risks to consider: European credits could be hit as the ECB tapers its APP.UK credits are vulnerable given the recent completion of the BoE corporate bond buying programme amid downside risks to the UK economic outlook. 


Global 

high-yield
Neutral




Positive factors: Corporate fundamentals are improving following a pick-up in the global activity cycle. Defaults remain comparatively low and we  think they are likely to be contained to commodity-related sectors.

Risks to consider: Further credit spread compression leaves a thin margin of safety. We are neutral with a negative bias


Other


Gold 
Neutral


Positive factors:  Fed  hikes are likely to remain historically gradual, limiting the opportunity-cost  of holding the non-yield generating asset. Rising inflationary pressures could  boost hedging demand, whilst high political risks/uncertainty could also be supportive. 

Risks to consider: A  stronger-than-expected Fed hiking cycle may push the USD higher.


Other commodities
Neutral


Positive factors: With oil demand growth remaining robust there is scope for the market to continue to rebalance, particularly following OPEC’s November output cut deal (extended to March 2018)

Risks to consider: Oil  markets could remain oversupplied, especially if US production remains  resilient. Industrial metals remain exposed to the pace of China’s economic  rebalancing and global growth.


Real estate 
Neutral


Positive factors: Based on our dividend growth assumptions and current yields, which offer a premium of around 1.4 per cent points above the dividend yield from wider equities, we believe real estate equities are priced to deliver reasonably attractive long-run returns compared to developed-marked government bonds.  In the long run, rents are positively related to wider economic growth and offer a partial inflation hedge.

Risks to consider: The  US has underperformed other listed property markets in recent months. Concerns  over the health of some retailers have dragged down retail-oriented Real Estate  Investment Trusts. In this environment, we believe higher quality malls and  shopping centres are likely to outperform stocks with weaker portfolios.  The UK's decision to leave the EU has reduced  rental growth prospects, especially in central London, and increased  uncertainty around future occupier demand.

Global central banks shift to a more hawkish stance   




Markets: global equities little changed in June; oil prices fell on oversupply concerns; 10-year Treasuries dipped
Global equities were little changed in June, supported by data showing robust economic activity which helped offset concerns over a tightening of global monetary policy. The MSCI AC World index closed flat over the month. In the US, the S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, with financial stocks outperforming on a steeper yield curve (supporting banks’ profitability outlook) and the US Federal Reserve’s decision to allow major US banks to engage in share buybacks. European stocks retreated, however, as a surge in the euro against the US dollar weighed on exporter shares in the region. In emerging markets, the MSCI EM rose (+1.2 per cent), although the MSCI Russia fell for the third consecutive month amid further falls in oil prices, as investors remained concerned that the market is oversupplied due to rising output from Libya and the US. In the government bond space, 10-year US Treasuries and core European bonds fell (yields rose) mainly on concerns about the trajectory of global monetary policy (all data above as of close of 30 June in local currency, price return, month-to-date terms).
US: the Fed is committed to its rate hiking cycle despite soft inflation prints
US underlying economic activity remains positive. Our “Nowcast” measure of underlying activity is tracking growth of 3.2 per cent for June, slightly higher than May (2.9 per cent). Meanwhile, core PCE inflation declined for the fifth consecutive month to 1.4 per cent in May, further away from the Fed’s 2 per cent target. This continued anaemic inflation backdrop is puzzling to many in the context of labour market tightening. Nevertheless, the Fed appears committed to its rate hiking cycle, raising the fed funds target rate by 25bps at its June meeting whilst maintaining its projection for one more hike by year-end. This meeting also saw the Fed signal it would begin unwinding its balancing sheet later this year. Overall, we think that the current environment of strong growth alongside higher interest rates and balance sheet normalisation reinforces the case for being underweight in US Treasuries, especially given that we now measure a negative implied term premium (i.e. compensation for bearing duration risk).

Eurozone: strength of activity maintains speculation of ECB taper in 2018

In the eurozone, recent data remains very robust, with the final release of Q1 GDP revised up to 0.6 per cent qoq. Positively, there seems to be a broadening of growth drivers to investment and exports, whilst more high frequency indicators, such as the PMIs, indicate this strength continued into Q2. The ECB reflected the more positive outlook at its June meeting, with the reference to taking rates “lower if needed” dropped from its statement. Although inflationary pressures remain elusive (the preliminary estimate for June headline inflation fell to 1.3 per cent yoy), the strength of recent economic data (and importantly diminished deflation risks) combined with technical buying constraints remain compelling arguments for a taper of the ECB’s QE programme next year. Macron’s election victory in France also removes a key event risk, whilst the unlocking of EUR8.5bn new loans for Greece during the month ensures the country will be able to make bond payments due in July (amid signs that the country will regain market access in the near term). An important breakthrough for Greece also came in the form of the eurozone’s agreement to introduce a growth-dependent debt-profiling mechanism. This means more debt relief will be granted if Greek growth deteriorates. Overall, we retain our overweight view on eurozone equities given relatively attractive risk premia on offer.
UK: election outcome raises Brexit related uncertainty
A year on from the UK’s referendum on EU membership, the UK economy is looking increasingly vulnerable as inflationary pressures bite into disposable incomes. Despite this, the June Bank of England meeting saw the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) take a hawkish turn, with three MPC members voting for a rate increase, predominantly driven by concerns over accelerating inflation. Although the probability of a near-term rate hike has risen, we expect the doves to prevail given risks to the UK economic outlook are firmly tilted to the downside. Furthermore, June’s UK general election result has also complicated the outlook for Brexit, with uncertainty over the stability of the Conservative-DUP alliance struck in the aftermath of the result. The range of outcomes remains very wide. For the time being, we retain our neutral stance on UK equities.
Asia: Chinese growth should remain resilient despite policy tightening; Japan QE taper remains a long way off
In China, the impact of financial deleveraging is evident in May’s M2 (money supply) growth which fell to a record low of 9.6 per cent yoy. Despite recent signs of an incrementally slower pace of liquidity and regulatory tightening, we think the authorities are not likely to reverse their tightening of financial and property policies. However, activity growth should remain resilient in the near term. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) kept its monetary policy unchanged in June, although it has recently reduced the amount of Japanese government bond purchases, fuelling speculation about a possible QE tapering. However, BoJ Governor Kuroda stated following the meeting that “with the 2 per cent inflation target still some way off, it is not appropriate to talk about how an exit is going to work”. Overall, a continuation of ultra-loose BoJ policy, along with attractive risk premia, supports our overweight view on the country’s equities.
EM: economic performance broadly remains on an improving trend, although political risk is a key constraint
Following two years of contraction, Brazil’s economy expanded in Q1 GDP (by +1.1 per cent qoq annualised). Positively, an improving inflation profile may hasten the path to recovery, as it gives the central bank extra room for monetary easing. Against this encouraging economic backdrop, investors shrugged off news during the month of President Temer’s indictment for corruption. Similarly, Russia’s economy is improving amid close-to-target inflation and central bank accommodation. This is particularly positive given the recent volatility in oil prices. Elsewhere, the Mexico’s central bank raised interest rates by another 25bps at its June meeting, but signalled that this could be the end of the tightening cycle. An aggressive Fed tightening path and US policy shifts, in particular NAFTA renegotiations, remain a key risk. Less positively, South Africa unexpectedly slipped into recession in Q1 for the first time since 2009, and is still vulnerable to political upheaval. Finally, in India, even though it stood pat on interest rates at its June meeting, the country’s central bank turned dovish in its policy statement, after slashing its inflation forecasts and reducing its growth projections for the coming quarters. Importantly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which will be rolled out on 1 July, could pose some risks to near-term growth due to inventory drawdowns and potential disruption to SMEs, but the impact is likely to be transitory.

Global Strategic Asset Allocations   




Global Strategic Asset Allocations (as at 31 May 2017)
Global equities rose for a seventh straight month in May, supported by continuing robust economic data releases and generally upbeat earnings reports. The implied equity premia on offer continues to warrant a neutral positioning for global equities, in our view, and we maintain our relative preference for European and Japanese equities which offer a better carry opportunity. 
In the credit space, spreads have compressed substantially over the past 12 months amid the risk of tighter than expected US monetary policy. However, a mix of good growth and low inflation should sustain low default and downgrade rates. 
Finally 10-year US Treasuries rose (yields fell) amid doubts about the Trump administration’s ability to implement pro-growth policies, with our measure of the implied term premium on 10-year Treasuries having become more negative. Overall, valuations in Bunds, Gilts and Japanese government bonds remain extreme and we continue to be structurally underweight in DM government bonds.
Within the allocations of our global multi-asset model portfolios, the underweight in DM government bonds is only significantly visible within the model portfolio for Risk Profile 2, where the lower volatility target prevents too high an allocation to global equities.

The above ‘Current Portfolio’ is based on regional HSBC Global Asset Management Asset Allocation meetings held throughout June 2017. The ‘SAA Portfolio’ is the result of HSBC Global Asset Management’s portfolio optimisation process. These model portfolios are expressed in USD.
Key  Terms

Strategic Asset Allocation Portfolio: Within AMG’s multi-asset investment process, the ‘SAA’ refers to the ‘Strategic Asset Allocations’, which are generated through optimising long-term estimates of both expected return and covariance. These form the portfolios’ reference allocation for each risk level.
Current Portfolio: The ‘Current Portfolio’ represents the portfolio’s current target exposure. This reflects any active positions currently held in the portfolio (i.e. ‘over/under weight’ positions relative to the SAA).  
Portfolio Tilt: The difference between the ‘Current Portfolio’ and ‘SAA Portfolio’ allocations. Positive values reflect overweight exposure i.e. where a positive outlook on a particular asset class is currently held. Conversely, negative values reflect underweight positions i.e. where the team currently maintain a more cautious outlook.
Portfolio Tilt Change: The change in Portfolio Tilts from the previous Multi-Asset Strategy meeting. 


Risk Profiles
Each of the three portfolios outlined above match different customer risk profiles, as defined by their target long-term volatility bands:

Risk Profile 2 has a long-term target volatility of 5-8 per cent. This portfolio typically has a substantial allocation to fixed income investments and some allocations to growth-oriented investments such as equities.
Risk Profile 3 has a long-term target volatility of 8-11 per cent. This portfolio typically has allocations to both fixed income investments and growth-oriented investments such as equities.
Risk Profile 4 has a long-term target volatility of 11-14 per cent. This portfolio typically has a high allocation to growth-oriented investments with higher risk levels.

Note:
The ‘Strategic Asset Allocations’ detailed above may sometimes appear to differ from the ‘Long-term Asset Class positioning’ table on pages 2 and 3 primarily due to portfolio constraints which include achieving portfolio volatility within the target long-term volatility bands and minimum and maximum asset class weights.
The above ‘Current Portfolio’ allocations are based on HSBC Global Asset Management’s current outlook and portfolio positioning. These positions are revisited on a monthly basis. The allocations are for illustrative purposes and are designed to be broadly representative of our current multi-asset positioning. Actual portfolio positioning may differ by product or client mandate due to manager discretion, local requirements, portfolio constraints and other additional factors. 
The ‘Current Portfolio’ allocations do not consider the investment objectives, risk tolerance or financial circumstances of any particular client. They should not be relied upon as investment advice, research, or a recommendation by HSBC Global Asset Management. Asset allocation and diversification may not protect against market risk, loss of principal or volatility of returns.
The reference index for ‘Equities’ is the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), which includes both developed and emerging market equities. The reference index for ‘Real Estate’ is the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index, which is designed to track the performance of listed real estate companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
