Pros:  User friendly and super easy to use. This was a difficult transition for our staff to leave the old company but once they spent a few minutes acclimating to the new software they loved it.
Overall:  Reduction of call handle time. No need to be on the phones typing info in any longer. This software is so easy to use we train live instead of spending time side jacking.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
