YEH, C SPENCER - SOLO VOICE I-X (LP)    


 "Solo Voice I - X is the first LP by C Spencer Yeh devoted entirely to the voice. Yeh's practice has its most obvious precedents in the sound poetry scene of the '60s and '70s - recalling an outlier group like the Four Horsemen, at their most raw and a-verbal, as much as the circles and canons forged around post-Lettrist France - as well as in figures like Joan La Barbara. Over the past few years, he has moved from virtuosic, intensely physical performances to more focused studies whose specific attachment to performance situations and even the body has become increasingly tenuous. Maintaining a strict fidelity to the specific properties of his voice, Yeh initially relied only on amplification (largely in order to bring into focus a rich grain of otherwise inaudible phenomena), before gradually introducing various studio techniques to fold the temporality of performance in on itself. Here he has edited out the breaths from recordings made in the studio, letting his vocalizations run together in palpitating continua. The effect is an elision of phrasing as an element of both linguistic and musical convention, and an uncanny protraction of the voice into vast, hypnotic slurs. Solo Voice I - X resumes the development of techniques and strategies which, taken together, form a kind of composition unto themselves. Deftly sequenced by Yeh, the LP progresses from a series of shorter tracks, each honing in on a particular sound or technique, towards more open-ended territory in which the formal rigor of the first half begins to dissolve, with Yeh's voice playing off both silence and itself."

    See all 3 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsTimelessByRichard M. Rolloon August 1, 2007Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThese sessions were recorded a little more than 50 years ago, near the end of Tatum's life.  Perhaps it was mere coincidence that it came at an end of that era in music as well; the shift to rock and roll and rhythm and blues.  Many of the songs are much older.Yet it all holds up so well.  This is acoustic piano played by a man who learned it in the cultural glory days of the parlor player piano, the symbol of middle class arrival in its day.In these recordings, you hear everything about the piano from a man for whom the piano was everything.  In Tea For Two, he does what many classical composers have done in  writing variations on a simple theme.  Only these are performances as well as compositions.  There are stories that he could play Tea for Two for an hour and never repeat the same variation on it twice.  It has to be heard to be believed.If it were possible to build a piano with more than 88 keys, Tatum would already know where they were and what to do with them.Another of my favorites, I Didn't Know What Time It Was.  This is the kind of song Sinatra described as a "saloon song."  Tatum preserves that quality of the song while making it fit together like a well crafted sonata.  There are even a few soft diminished chimes.  The time?  Time to listen to more Tatum.0Comment|

    See the review5.0 out of 5 starsGround ZeroByMike TarraniHALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERon February 8, 2015Format: MP3 Music|Verified PurchaseNOTE: This review is for the 13-track album titled Solo Piano, which has also been incorrectly linked to another set by the same name. That one contains 20 tracks. If you are scratching your head as you read this review you are probably on the page to which this site erroneously cross linked product pages.This is Mckenna's first album as a leader and a truly auspicious start of his long career.Since there are sound samples in this page I'll refrain from any pretentious analysis and let those convey the essence of the music. I will say that McKenna's signature sound - especially his left hand - are already prominent in his playing. He was twenty-five when this album was recorded for ABC records in NYC on October 31, 1955.The song selections are fairly generic for a mid 1950s piano album, but it's clear that McKenna makes each one his own. This album has the same tracks as the original ABC 104 release in 1956, but the session produced two additional tracks - Warm Valley and Limehouse Blues - that were included on a reissue titled Piano Solo that is a two album reissue that you may want to consider. That set also contains an out-of-print 1963 album titled Lullabies of Jazz, in addition to the two tracks from the 1955 session.Regardless of which way you decide to go, you will not go wrong with this album is you are a jazz pianist or a McKenna fan.11 comment|

Bass wood body ,maple neck .Hot PUs. Neck pocket needed a little tidying up ,nut had to be reslotted. neck alingement right on.Personally chose to upgrade pots and input jack. Intonation right on.You gotta start off with good wood.Half of what it would cost from other suppliers and hardware to boot. I’m not one for fancy finishes so i was playing in 2 days.I’ve been playing and giging for 50 years.Played ’em all.This is a good deal.More than what I expected for my money.Don’t get me wrong it ain’t a $2000 guitar,but for the money,sweet.Take care.
    Rated 4 out of 5 charles (verified owner) – January 22, 2017  the quality of the guitar was good. nice neck of course you have to fine tune but the direction came whit the guitar is easy to understand. the only thing is the cavity for the 3 way selector is not the right deep i cant screw it in place whit the plastic ring and miss the six screw for headstock tuner if one of those day i buy another diy kit i take it from solomusic gear buy it december 2017 and receve it few days later
    Rated 4 out of 5 JWB (verified owner) – March 20, 2017  Good solid kit for beginners. Neck was described to me as a bit “clubby”. I did not find it so, and am looking forward to finish and play. Pre-fit of parts showed close tolerances on laser cut outs. Was pleased with that, particularly on neck to body fit (will not require shims, etc.) Overall am expecting this kit guitar will make a great addition to my personal line up.
    Rated 4 out of 5 Frank (verified owner) – June 28, 2017  Just great…. For hand skilled person of course. I need to do a little bit of adjustement for the neck to fit correctly and mine had a little too much angle for an LP, so just remove a little bit of wood to be as i want…. And really fast shipping, i receive it in 3 days… I will try another model soon, so i recommend it….

It took about 6 weeks to receive it. I was so excited when my husband opened the box until I saw a nick at the top of the wooden frame that was very noticeable. I was very upset, as I'd spent a lot of money on this item, but he said he'd just use a black marker to cover it up. and, once it was hung, he couldn't see the nick anyway. He absolutely loves it, but I'm still upset about the amount of money I paid to receive a defective piece of wooden frame. The packaging was great, so I'm not quite sure how the nick got there. I gave it a 4 star because of the idea of it and the fact that my husband loves it and doesn't want to send it back for a new one.Display Location:HallwayWas this a gift?:YesWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/31/2016 4.0Great anniversary gift idea By Amyfrom GeorgiaProsGreat Quality MaterialNice WorkmanshipPerfect SizeVisually AppealingConsBest UsesGiftComments about UncommonGoods Personalized LP Record:This gift was perfect because I went with the 'platinum' idea for our 20th wedding anniversary. I tracked down vinyl albums he didn't have in his collection and had some autographed.. as well as this gift. It worked perfectly with the over all idea because I had it labeled like most artist do for 'their platinum collection of songs'. It was a collection of our favorite songs while we were dating.
