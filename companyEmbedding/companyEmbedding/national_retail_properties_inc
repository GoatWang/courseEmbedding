Developer Finance Program




Our acquisitions team purchases single-tenant, net-leased retail properties throughout the United States primarily through sale-leaseback transactions.  We also partner with national and regional retailers providing real estate expansion funding.
By selling the property and building to NNN, and then leasing it back from us, retailers are able to redeploy the proceeds into their company’s core operation and yield a higher return than they would get from owning their own real estate.
As a publicly-traded REIT, our access to public markets allows us to make all-cash purchases and execute quick and efficient transactions, giving us a competitive advantage over companies that rely on obtaining debt to finance acquisitions.
For more information, or to be contacted by an acquisitions officer, please submit your contact information.

Frequently Asked Questions








About Us

Glossary
Frequently Asked Questions
Contact Us




Who do I contact with questions about my stock?
Can I purchase shares directly from National Retail Properties?
When are dividends declared and paid?
How can I reinvest my dividends?
What is a net lease and why is that your preferred method of leasing properties to tenants?
What happens when a tenant goes bankrupt and closes a store?

Who do I contact with questions about my stock?

Registered holders with questions about account statements, account name changes, dividend payments, lost stock certificates, etc. should contact our transfer agent:American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
Attn: Shareholder Services
6201 15th Avenue
Brooklyn, NY 11219
Web site: www.amstock.com
Toll-free Telephone:  866-627-2644
Email: info@amstock.com
Beneficial holders (shares held through a brokerage account) should contact their broker on all administrative matters.

Can I purchase shares directly from National Retail Properties?

Our Direct Stock Purchase Plan allows the purchase of shares directly from our plan administrator, American Stock Transfer & Trust.  Click here to view our DSPP prospectus.

When are dividends declared and paid?

Our common and preferred stock dividends are declared and paid quarterly.  Historically, our common stock dividends have typically been declared on or about the 15th of January, April, July and October and typically paid on or about the 15th of February, May, August and November. Our preferred dividends (currently Series E) have historically been declared on or about the 15th of February, May, August and November and typically paid on or about the 15th of March, June, September and December.

How can I reinvest my dividends?

There are two ways to enroll in the Dividend Reinvestment plan.  Registered holders may join the plan by completing and signing an authorization form and returning it to the plan administrator, or by following the enrollment procedures specified on the administrator’s website at www.amstock.com.Beneficial holders who wish to join the plan must instruct their broker, bank or other nominee to arrange participation in the plan on the beneficial holder’s behalf.  The broker, bank or other nominee should then make arrangements with its securities depository and the securities depository will provide the plan administrator with the information necessary to allow the beneficial holder to participate in the plan.
To facilitate participation by beneficial holders, we have made arrangements with the plan administrator to reinvest dividends and accept optional cash payments under the stock purchase program by record holders such as brokers, banks and other nominees, on behalf of beneficial holders.  If you are an interested beneficial holder, be sure that your broker, bank or other nominee passes along the proceeds of any applicable discount to your account.
Alternatively, a beneficial holder may simply request that number of shares the beneficial holder wishes to be enrolled in the plan be re-registered by the broker, bank or other nominee in the beneficial holder’s own name as a record holder in order to participate directly in the plan.
Here is a link to the full prospectus in a PDF format that has a detailed Q&A section dedicated solely to the plan.
The enrollment form, if you choose to set up a registered record holder account, is on pages 61-62 of the PDF.

What is a net lease and why is that your preferred method of leasing properties to tenants?

A net lease requires the tenant of a property to bear many of the costs associated with the property.  Such costs would typically include real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and utilities. Many times our properties are leased on a triple net lease basis.  Our New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol is “NNN” because this is the real estate industry moniker for triple net lease.  We strongly believe that using net leases provide increased stability to our rental revenue over the long term because we’re insulated against increases in these property operating costs.

What happens when a tenant goes bankrupt and closes a store?

Bankruptcy by a tenant does not necessarily mean loss of rent or vacancy.  Tenants in bankruptcy must reject a lease before they can stop making rent payments.  We have had a few cases of retailers filing for bankruptcy and never missing a rent payment to us during their reorganization process.  If they do reject the lease, they must vacate the property and we can then seek to re-lease the property to another user.

More specifically these companies choose to invest in people logistics and technology rather than real estate. In addition many of our tenants are looking to improve their balance sheets pay down existing debt boost working capital and/or gain immediate access to cash by unlocking the value in their real estate.Competitors of National Retail PropertiesMarangoni Tread N.A.

Need help justifying your attendance at the NRTA's Expanding Knowledge Conference in New Orleans on September 24-27, 2017? 
NRTA's Curriculum Committee members developed a new tool to help you justify your attendance through evaluating the potential Return on Investment (ROI) of attending this year’s conference! The simple ROI Calculator helps tie a value to the benefit generated by NRTA conference attendance, and allows your employer to see the net return to your company’s bottom line. Go ahead, do your own math! Help your employer with making this go/no-go decision. Simply download, complete, and present. In addition to the quantifiable ROI, this education forum offers valuable opportunities to network with your peers in retail and corporate real estate and to keep up with the latest trends and best practices in the profession. Be sure to visit our “Getting Approval” page for more suggestions.

Make A Difference
Conference attendees are volunteering for a rebuild day with St. Bernard Parish (SBP) in NOLA. Now you can join in this give back experience on Sunday, Sept. 24th from 8:00a-12:30p. You'll be busy with home rebuilding and cleaning projects, and will be working alongside the families who are reclaiming their homes and neighborhoods - and you don't need to be a contractor or even handy with tools; you just need the spirit and willingness to give some of your time and effort.
Use this link to complete the combined signup/waiver form. Spots are limited, so be sure to sign up soon!
We'd also like to thank NRTA member company TANGO for sponsoring the on-site transportation to support this community project.

Conference Keynote Speaker Jill Stratton, Ph.D. offers integrated research with practical strategies on how workers can improve effectiveness. Learn more
