1 Foreign Currency Term Deposits are not offered within an RSP; are not an insured deposit as defined by CDIC and are fully guaranteed by TD Bank Financial Group. Foreign Currency Term Deposits are subject to foreign exchange risk as the underlying currency may appreciate or depreciate during the investment term.
* Laddering strategies can be ideal for shorter time horizons too. The key is to spread out your investments and maximize your return over your preferred time horizon. 






The benefits of laddering GIC maturities
Developing a laddered maturities plan can be an easy way to help you maximize GIC returns while maintaining a secure portfolio. This proven method of investing (also known as a laddering strategy) can help you reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations and increase your portfolio's overall return.

Laddering maturities can be achieved in two steps:
 1. Dividing the amount you are planning to invest by 5 (e.g. $10,000.00 equals five investments of $ 2,000.00 each).
2. Equally investing in five GICs of one- to five-year terms (e.g. $2,000 in a one-year GIC, $2,000 in two-year GIC, $2,000 in five-year GIC).


As a result, 20% (1/5th) of your portfolio will mature each year. This can be cashed, or reinvested for five years at the then prevailing rate. This strategy locks in the portfolio for higher long-term rates, yet also provides liquidity.
Strategies for maximizing return while minimizing risk
If your goal is to reduce interest rate risk, you can begin by spreading the maturity dates so that one or more certificates (and approximately 20% of your GIC portfolio) comes up for renewal each year for the next five years.

If you want to increase the rate of return, every time a certificate comes up for renewal, reinvest it as a 5-year GIC. Work toward a portfolio of laddered 5-year GICs with some renewing each year, so that you receive the higher long-term rates.

Have a few questions?
We've provided answers to some of the most common questions people have about GICs and Term Deposits.
Collapse
 Can I cash out early?
Yes, cashable GICs and Term Deposits may be cashed-in early, in full or in part, subject to certain terms and conditions.
Expand
 How are my earnings taxed?
Earnings in GICs and Term Deposits held in a registered plan, such as RSPs are tax-deferred and tax-free when held in a TFSA. Earnings received on non-registered GICs and Term Deposits will be taxed as interest income in the year in which it is earned. A T5 is issued after maturity.
Expand
 Why are some products called GICs and others called Term Deposits?
Term Deposits and GICs both offer secured investments with guaranteed returns. The main difference is in the duration of the investment. Term Deposits tend to have a shorter investment period of one year or less, while GICs can be locked-in for longer periods of time, up to 5 years.
Expand
 Can I buy GICs in registered accounts?
Yes, GICs can be purchased within both non-registered or registered accounts, such as RSPs and TFSAs.

Saving for a vacation




 When you’re
                                 working hard, a well-deserved vacation can refresh 
                                 and energize you. Just planning a vacation is proven to
                                 boost your overall happiness.1



                                 Before you start putting money away for your next trip, it’s
                                 wise to explore your options and see just what type
                                 of vacation suits you best. Is it a week at an
                                 all-inclusive resort, a month-long self-guided trip
                                 through Europe, or a cruise through the Mediterranean?
                              

                                 Canadians taking time off during the winter will generally
                                 spend about $2,600.2

                                    (PTS). A PTS can easily be set up so that you are
                                    automatically transferring the money  for your
                                    vacation from your chequing account to your savings account
                                    on a regular basis.
                                 

                                    Another great way to put money aside for a vacation is the

                                    contribute $0.05 - $5 from your chequing to your TD Every

                                    and watch those smaller contributions add up to a great
                                    vacation.
                                 









Saving Tips



                                          In addition to your budgeted savings, there are lots of
                                          small things you can do that could really  add up and
                                          help you reach your goal sooner. Take a look at some easy
                                          savings tips:
                                       
Every time you get a deal, like a 2-for-1 or use
                                          a coupon, put that money you would have  spent right into
                                          your savings.
                                       
Use cash. Put your weekly entertainment budget in
                                          cash so you can easily see how much  your spending and
                                          how much you have left. If it’s getting low, you might
                                          decide to skip that afternoon treat.

Saving for a wedding




 Congratulations!
                                 Getting engaged and planning a wedding are joyful times in
                                 one’s life. A wedding is a wonderful opportunity to
                                 celebrate an exciting step in your life, and host an event
                                 with family and friends that you won’t ever forget.
                              

                                 You may have been dreaming of this day for years, or are
                                 just beginning to plan. Either way, it’s easy for
                                 wedding costs to really add up.The average expected
                                 cost of a wedding in Canada excluding the honeymoon
                                 is $22,429.1 So, it’s important to sit
                                 down with your future spouse or family and talk about what
                                 is really important for you both to have at your
                                 wedding and what’s flexible. Once you know these
                                 details, you can begin saving for your special day.
                              







Here are our suggestions to help you save
                              for a wedding








Start Saving Today





                                    Opening a TD
                                    High Interest Savings Account(HISA) will give you a place
                                    to put away the money you’re saving for your wedding, along
                                    with any monetary help you’ve received from family or
                                    friends.
                                 





                                       Once you’ve got your savings account open, setting up a
                                       monthly Pre-authorized
                                       Transfer Service
                                        is an easy way to make sure the money you’ve allocated
                                       for the wedding gets from your chequing account to your
                                       HISA on a regular basis.
                                    




 40% of couples
                                    are engaged for 13-18 months before tying the knot,which is
                                    a nice amount of time to build your wedding savings.2










Saving Tips


Set up a short-term savings goal. Saving just $20
                                          a week can add up to over $1,000 a year.
                                       
Save all your change. At the end of each day,
                                          take all the change from your wallet and place it in a
                                          ‘wedding fund’ jar. Just $2 a day from each of you can
                                          add up to over $1,000 in a year.
                                       








  



Put your savings to work for
                                    you
                                 





                                    Once you’ve had time to accumulate some savings for your
                                    wedding, you can start to invest it and earn more money.
                                 

                                    Talk to a Financial Advisor about investing your savings
                                    into a Guaranteed
                                    Investment Certificate(GICs) or Term
                                    Deposits that have a maturity date that align with your
                                    wedding planning.
                                 





                                       GICs and Term Deposits provide a safe way to save because
                                       your initial investment is protected. Many GICs and Term
                                       Deposits have flexible terms that range from 30 days to
                                       five years, so depending on when you’re having your
                                       wedding, this could be a good option for growing your
                                       savings.

Saving for a home or condo down payment







                                 Taking the step
                                 to buy a home of your own is a very exciting and
                                 rewarding experience. A good place to get started is
                                 considering your options: condo or house? The
                                 neighbourhood? Fixer-upper or new construction?
                                 Once you’ve got a feel for the cost implications of
                                 these decisions, then you can roughly determine

Saving Tips

                                          In addition to your budgeted savings, there are lots of
                                          small things you can do that could really add up
                                          and help you reach your goal sooner. Take a look at some
                                          easy savings tips:
                                       



Save your change! If you put your spare change
                                          aside at the end of every day, it can really add
                                          up. That $1.00 of change a day saves you $365.00 a year.
                                       
Take your lunch at least twice a week. If you’re
                                          saving $10 each time you bring your lunch, that
                                          could add up to close to $1,000 in savings a year.
                                       
Borrow instead of buy. Your neighbourhood library
                                          has tons of books and DVDs to choose from, so
                                          instead of buying a new book or DVD each month – sign
                                          them out for free. That could add up to around
                                          $240 of savings a year.3

                                       lower your risk because your money is not
                                       dependent on the performance of a single investment.

Saving for a child's education






A post-secondary education is an important step to ones’  success, and helping a child realize that goal is a great achievement.
But the cost of higher education is rising, and tuition alone can be quite expensive. The average university tuition in Canada is approximately $5,7001 a year and that doesn’t include books or living expenses.
With the right planning, you can make saving a part of  your routine and help your education savings grow.

Here are our suggestions to help save for a

Start Saving Today





                                          Start by opening a Registered 
                                          Education Savings Plan(RESP) for a child. An RESP is an account registered with the Government of 
                                          Canada to help you save for a child’s post-secondary education. When you contribute to an RESP, you 
                                          become eligible for  government grants that can amount to thousands of dollars for a child’s future 
                                          education.
                                       




 The government gives you a basic grant of 20% on the first $2,500 of annual contributions to an RESP. That's up to $500 per beneficiary each year to a lifetime limit of $7,200 towards a child's education.





This chart assumes a 2% rate of return (moderate risk portfolio) compounded annually until the child is 18 years old. Savings include your contributions, government contributions, and investment income. Calculations assume basic Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) contribution of 20% annually. Additional CESG grants may be available depending on your income.

Build education savings for your child using the Universal Child Care Benefit

The enhanced UCCB can be a great way to start saving for a child’s education.

The federal government through the Universal Child Care Benefit provides monthly payments to families of $160 per child between 0-5, and $60 per child between 6-17. That’s a total of up to $20,160 per child in lifetime benefits. 
With an Education Savings Plan, you're eligible to receive the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG), which matches 20% of annual contributions up to a maximum of $500 per year and $7,200 lifetime limit, per child. That means you could receive up to $4,0322 in CESG benefits per child when you contribute your full UCCB payments from age 0 to 17 amounting to $20,160 to an RESP.3

So start or increase your education savings by putting your UCCB into a RESP at TD.

Saving for retirement




 We all look forward to the day

                                    you start saving the more you’ll have to work with
                                    later on. 
                                 

                                    According to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian retires
                                    by the age of 63.1 That means the
                                    average retirement in Canada now lasts for
                                    approximately 20 years.

                                       RSP, helping you build a larger retirement fund for the
                                       future. A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is another great
                                       option to help save towards your retirement goal, because
                                       your savings grow tax-free. You don't pay taxes on
                                       the investment income or growth earned in your TFSA, even
                                       upon withdrawal, - helping you build your savings
                                       faster.
                                    





                                          Consider setting up an Automated
                                          Savings Plan. Automatically transferring funds from your
                                          everyday chequing account into your RSP or TFSA account
                                          provides a disciplined approach to saving. With this
                                          savings method, you’ll never have to worry or wonder about
                                          missing a contribution and your savings can grow without
                                          you even thinking about it.
                                       











Saving Tips
There are lots of small things that can help your
                                             savings add up:
                                          



Take advantage of an employees savings programs
                                             in which your employer matches or supplements what you’re
                                             contributing.
                                          
Put any bonuses you receive right into your
                                             savings. Set aside a small amount to treat yourself, but
                                             put the majority of that bonus away.
                                          








  



Put your savings to work for
                                       you

Starting your savings







                                    Building savings is not only
                                    beneficial for things you may want to do in the
                                    future, like buy a home or take a nice vacation, but also 
                                    provides a layer of security in times of uncertainty.
                                 

                                    Half of Canadians are putting less than 5% of their pay 
                                    cheque towards savings.1


                                    A general guideline is to put at least 10% of your income
                                    towards your savings. Even if you’re currently
                                    paying off student loans or other debt, it’s
                                    essential to ensure you pay yourself too. Then over
                                    time as you make more, you can increase the amount you save as well.

Start Saving Today





                                       Open a TD
                                       High Interest Savings Account or a Tax-Free
                                       Savings Account  to begin saving towards your
                                       goal. Make it easier to save by setting up an automatic
                                       savings plan called Pre-authorized
                                       Transfer Service
                                       (PTS). A PTS will automatically move funds from your
                                       everyday bank account into your savings account.
                                       This is a great way to grow your savings without you even
                                       having to think about it.
                                    





                                          Another great way to put money aside is the Simply Save
                                          program. With Simply Save, every transaction you make with
                                          your TD Access Card you are also making a contribution to
                                          your savings. You can choose to contribute $0.05 - $5 from
                                          your chequing to your TD Every Day Savings Account.
                                       











Saving Tips

                                             There are lots of small things you can do that could
                                             really add up and help you reach your goal
                                             sooner. Take a look at some easy savings tips:
                                          



Write a shopping list and stick to it to help
                                             prevent those impulse buys from adding up.
                                          
While you’re at it, buy generic. Many pantry
                                             basics are just as good, if not better, than the brand
                                             name items you pay more for.
                                          
Switch one night out a week to a night in.
                                             Instead of meeting friends for dinner, have a get
                                             together at your place.
                                          








  



Put your savings to work for
                                       you
                                    




Once you've had the time to
                                       build up some savings, you can start to invest it and earn
                                       more money.
                                    






                                          Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) and Term
                                          Deposits provide a safe way to save because your initial
                                          investment is protected. Many GICs and Term Deposits also
                                          guarantee a rate of return for the term of your
                                          investment, which can help you plan when and how you’ll
                                          use that money.
                                       







Mutual
                                          Funds provide easy access to the growth potential offered
                                          by stocks and bonds without you needing to be an expert.
                                          Professionals will select and manage the investments held
                                          in the mutual fund to seek to maximize growth, as well as
                                          help you plan when and how you can use your savings.

Targa Prices Equity Offering to Fund $1.3B Pipeline ProjectHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)LISTENWho is the face of pro baseball?Yahoo Finance's Dan Roberts and Myles Udland debate the business of baseballTarga Prices Equity Offering to Fund $1.3B Pipeline ProjectZacks Equity ResearchZacksMay 30, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareShares of Texas-based midstream energy player Targa Resources Corp TRGP slumped to a six-month low to close at $47.34 on May 26. The decline came post the announcement of the company’s plans to raise equity to fund the construction of its new natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline – Grand Prix.The NGL pipeline will connect Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico to the company’s plant in Mont Belvieu, east of Houston. The pipeline will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and Targa's North Texas system to the company’s fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu. Total capital expenditure associated with the Grand Prix project is expected to be around $1.3 billion, out of which the company intends to spend approximately $250 million in 2017. The company's total capex budget for 2017 totaled approximately $1.25 billion. Targa expects Grand Prix’s transport capacity to be approximately 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), expandable up to 550,000 bpd. The pipeline is expected to come into service in the second quarter of 2019.Targa, which is one of the largest gatherers and processors of natural gas in the Permian, has been looking for opportunities to leverage its growing gathering and processing volumes to additional downstream options. Grand Prix is likely to enhance the company’s ability to move customers’ volumes from the wellhead in the Permian Basin and North Texas to key petrochemical and export markets.Grand Prix is the latest in the series of proposed NGL pipelines to serve Permian Basin.  Earlier this month, Houston’s energy explorer Apache Corporation APA announced plans to spend $500 million to construct an NGL pipeline in Permian Basin. In April, midstream energy player Enterprise Products Partners L.P. EPD also announced to build Shin Oak NGL pipeline which is expected to come to service by the second quarter of 2019. DCP Midstream, L.P. DCP is also planning to expand the transport capacity of its Sand Hills NGL pipeline connecting Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu.In a separate statement, Targa has planned to launch a public offering of 17 million shares of its common stock at $46.10 per share, with an underwriter’s option to purchase up to an additional 2.55 million of common shares.  The company expects to receive net proceeds of $777.3 million, excluding the underwriter’s right to exercise their option.  Part of the proceeds from the offering will be used to fund the construction of Grand Prix pipeline. The rest will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities, redeem senior notes and for general corporate purposes.Zacks RankTarga is a midstream natural gas and natural gas liquid service provider in U.S. The company processes, stores, transports and provides related services of NGL components. Targa, under the Zacks categorized Oil Refining & Marketing MLP, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Targa Resources, Inc. Price Targa Resources, Inc. Price | Targa Resources, Inc.
