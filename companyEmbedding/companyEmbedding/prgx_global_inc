DO YOU REALLY KNOWYOUR SUPPLIER? 
		


 











Increased regulations, supply chain globalization, and an activist public that is demanding transparency and holding companies accountable for their suppliers’ actions make it critical that companies implement “know your supplier” programs.
Having worked at the intersection of buyer and supplier relationships, we understand the challenges facing global organizations and the enterprise risk they present. Our supplier information management solution helps companies assess regulatory compliance, mitigate risk, and rate sustainability practices in their supplier base.

Product Cost Harmonization










Every day the retail environment gets more competitive. In the fight to maximize margins, even small variances can translate into millions of dollars in lost profit.
It can be difficult to for a retailer to know if they are buying the same or equivalent product across multiple markets and regions; managing or harmonizing product cost is critical to realizing savings and optimize your purchasing power. It’s not unusual for costs on the same product to vary three to five percent between regions within a single retail organization.
With these insights, retailers can identify “quick hits” savings opportunities and be better prepared for supplier negotiations – – enabling them to capture 2% – 5% COGS reduction opportunities on goods for resale.
 

Provide True Cost Visibility by calculating the front and back margin at an item level 
Employ Global Product Aggregation to find identical products and equivalent items through product code matching algorithms, and descriptions from the product master (brand, size, color, flavor, etc.) 
Combine Global Product Aggregation and True Cost Visibility to analyze product cost variances across markets—identifying where the same product is purchased at a different cost


With these insights, retailers can identify “quick hits” savings opportunities and be better prepared for supplier negotiations – – enabling them to get at these 3% – 5% margin opportunities.

PRGX Global, Inc. Announces Appointment Of New Vice President - Analytics Product Management






GlobeNewswire



Jun 24, 2016 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































 ATLANTA, June 24, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PRGX Global, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRGX), a global leader in Recovery Audit and Spend Analytics services, today announced that Justin Honoman has been named Vice President - Analytics Product Management, responsible for the Company's Analytics services. Mr. Honoman joins the Company from Moxie USA, part of the Publicis Groupe, where he was SVP, Digital Marketing Solutions, delivering capabilities across channels in the marketing space and responsible for delivery of solutions to clients, and business development to grow the business. Prior to Moxie, Mr. Honoman worked for Teradata Corporation as Managing Partner and GM, Consumer Goods (CPG) for the Retail North America Analytics Practice. Prior to Teradata, Mr. Honoman held sales and marketing leadership roles with Coca-Cola, The North Highland Company, E.piphany, Inc., and iXL, Inc. Mr. Honoman began his career at Ernst & Young, LLP. "We are delighted to have Justin join our Adjacent Services team and look forward to leveraging his valuable experience, skills and knowledge to assist PRGX in optimizing our business development and sales results.  He will be instrumental in defining and managing our analytics service offerings to drive exceptional value for our clients," said Sal DePrima, Senior Vice President - Growth and Market Development. In connection with Mr. Honoman's employment, on June 20, 2016, the Company granted an equity award to Mr. Honoman consisting of 30,000 performance-based restricted stock units (PBUs). The PBUs vest and become payable based on revenue from continuing operations and the cumulative adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations that the Company achieves for the two year performance period ending December 31, 2017. The PBUs also vest in full in the event of a change in control of the Company, provided Mr. Honoman remains continuously employed by the Company until such event. Upon vesting, the PBUs will be settled by the issuance of a number of shares of Company common stock equal to 40% of the number of PBUs being settled and the payment of cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of that number of shares of common stock equal to 60% of the number of PBUs being settled. The PBUs were otherwise granted on substantially the same terms as the performance-based restricted stock units granted to the Company's executive officers on March 31, 2016.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
