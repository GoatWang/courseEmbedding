For most people, a successful construction project is simply one that is completed. They consider construction a nuisance because it slows traffic or is a loud distraction outside their window and are therefore relieved when the project is complete and life returns to normal. But in reality, there is so much more that goes into creating and delivering successful projects.At Rhumbix, our employees have worked on major construction endeavours all over the world, and have experienced first-hand successes and failures on the jobsite. Below are a few areas we focus on when planning for project success, and by extension, what we are building into our mobile platform.Health and Safety: First and foremost, did our friends, colleagues and workers experience incidents or injuries while on the jobsite. At Rhumbix we believe productive projects are safe projects, and vice versa, so planning for project success will always rely on an effective health, safety and environmental management program. All incidents and accidents are preventable, and appropriate safety management techniques and practices form the foundation upon which project success is built.Budgeting and Forecasting: Construction involves so many moving parts that delivering projects at or under budget will always be a challenge. Cost is obviously a major resource constraint when procuring and executing construction, but at Rhumbix we believe that value delivered to the customer is a better metric for measuring price than simply the lowest cost. The lowest bid is rarely the best price for the owner, and often masks a significant risk that costs will rise. Contractors often bid on work knowing that design changes will enable the price to grow as the project scope is more clearly defined.At Rhumbix we believe that value delivered to the customer is a better metric for measuring price than simply the lowest cost.Construction is such a dynamic process that changes in scope are difficult to avoid, which is why real-time visibility and a transparent understanding of site operations goes a long way towards identifying the true factors impacting project cost performance, and enabling more insightful and intelligent decisions that support budgeting and forecasting efforts.Planning: Effective planning is without doubt the most important control tool for construction. Scheduling and cost management support project execution, and planning gets them built. Planning is, however, complicated by the use of different systems and processes. High level milestone schedules and management or control schedules exist in programs like Primavera, however more detailed look ahead and weekly work plans are often developed in Excel or on Post-it notes in pull planning sessions. Disconnects between schedules and plans, and offices and the field all complicate the development, distribution, consumption and feedback into construction planning.Rhumbix facilitates the sharing of information between developers of the plan, and the people that actually have to use them by creating a feedback loop from foremen in the field to planners and supervisors. Assuring that plans reflect the reality of what can be built, and what is actually getting built is key to effective project planning.Productivity: Efficient use of resources is key to productive construction, yet there are a myriad of factors that can hinder productivity. From incorrect or missing materials to design clashes, broken equipment to unexpected weather, obstacles for work crews exist around every corner.Construction is all about getting the right people and materials to the right place at the right time, and effective communication plays a big role in making this happen.At Rhumbix, we know we don’t have all the answers, but the craftsmen at the work face probably do. Construction is all about getting the right people and materials to the right place at the right time, and effective communication plays a big role in making this happen. Rhumbix provides a means for project stakeholders to communicate issues impacting productivity like never before. We’ve built customised workflows and processes that aid in the identification of changing conditions, and allow them to be recorded and quantified so meaningful action can be taken.There is no such thing as a standardized construction project, and there is rarely a template you can overlay from a previous project that guarantees success. Projects that are large in scope and scale inevitably have lots of challenges and growing pains, and even smaller projects can be enormously complex.The extent to which you can tie process and people together is going a long way to build the foundations and conditions that lead to success.This is why it’s so important to have the data you need when you need it. Success really hinges on connecting the dynamics of crews and project teams through sharing timely and accurate data.The extent to which you can tie process and people together is going a long way to build the foundations and conditions that lead to success for everyone involved, whether you’re the worker who built it, or the person who inhabits the built environment once it is completed.Written by Guy Skillett, Director of Construction at Rhumbix.Share15Never miss a story from Rhumbix Inc, when you sign up for Medium.

Rhumbix Wants To Be The Palantir For Construction

Dispatch Joins The Ground Delivery Club












Two former Naval Engineers are trying to turn construction management on its head. Stanford Graduate School of Business alumni Zachary Scheel and Drew DeWalt are behind Rhumbix, a company whose product optimizes construction management and labor payment as well as divining best practices out of user data.
The company’s platforms is centered on a phone app with different iterations depending on user – different levels of data are exposed to Project Managers, Foremen, and so on. Rhumbix leverages navigation and geolocation capabilities of smartphones to derive locations of construction workers, and anonymizes them to the construction crew level.
The company’s potential is fairly large, given the sheer number of construction projects ongoing globally at any given time. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that Greylock just invested 5.1 Million Dollars in the company’s 6 Million Dollar Series A. This Series A investment comes on top of earlier investments from Darren Bechtel’s Brick and Mortar Ventures and Michael Paulus, who is now a partner at Andreessen Horowitz.
http://rhumbix.com/indoorlocation/BeaconTest.mp4
The bulk of the software is centered on using geolocation to accurately pay workers for the number of hours worked, which is easier said than done. As Scheel explained, construction worker salaries are amalgamated from a variety of different monetary pots, each of which has its own cost code. Hundreds of cost codes exist on a site, making this more and more challenging at scale. Rhumbix also tracks pay, benefits, and other compensation.
“Fundamentally, it’s cost-code accounting,” explained Scheel. “Traditionally, this has been done by foremen using clipboards, which isn’t very accurate.”

More importantly, Rhumbix provides a vital medium for interaction between Project Managers, many of whom are recent Civil Engineering graduates, and experienced veteran construction workers.
“Rhumbix asks them everyday how the project can make better decisions, ” said DeWalt, explaining that he and Scheel first learnt the importance of this interaction in the Navy working with veteran crew chiefs.

 
Scheel explained that the inspiration for the product came from their experiences with Blue Force Tracking, a tool used by the US Military to track friendly (blue) forces in a user’s proximity. Tracking friendly forces all over North Africa while stationed in Djbouti led him to think about the potential of a similar tool for tracking construction workers and optimizing their workflow.
“[We’re] creating something like the Palantir for construction,” said Scheel.
In addition to giving managers a better understanding of where construction crews are positioned, preventing colocation and double-parking, Rhumbix has the potential to greatly increase the efficiencies at which construction companies operate. The software reduces the amount of time crews spend idle waiting for instructions or tasks.

One of the larger challenges that Rhumbix had to overcome was building a product that construction workers were willing to use.
“The data you collect from them [workers] is so valuable,” said Scheel. “But you have to earn those rights.”
Building a product that workers were willing to use is a lynchpin achievement. If that doesn’t work, the rest of the stack has no data to feed on. One tool to encourage this is the way that Rhumbix anonymizes individual data and only exposes the findings at a ‘crew’ level, reducing reluctance to contribute.
The team backgrounds may have fed into this decision. Scheel managed construction at Naval Bases from Everett, WA to Djbouti, Africa. DeWalt’s experiences as a Nuclear Submarine Officer on the Attack Submarine USS Cheyenne likely provided insight into the dynamics of crew members and managers in high-pressure situations.
While it’s still early days from Rhumbix, the company is slowly racking up an impressive list of clients which includes Anvil Builders as well as some key subcontractors building the massive Salesforce tower.

 What People are Saying

Industry research shows that during an 8 hour day craft workers generally achieve less than 2 hours of productive work. If we as an industry can better quantify where these inefficiencies are coming from, we can react faster to them. There may even come a point when we can better plan for them. It is a classic case of what gets measured gets attention. I have witnessed the inefficiencies in my own operations; the reasons for them are limitless. Being able to capture the systemic issues allows us to address them and not waste time addressing the one-off situations.Any contractor can buy materials, purchase tools and rent equipment. What separates any contractor from their competitors is the people. The more we can empower our people at all levels to solve problems and work more efficiently the better we will be. I feel that Rhumbix helps to empower our field crews to have a greater understanding of how their time effects the bottom line and how to address it.

This is the most-innovative thing we’re doing right now as a company.

— Luis G., 20+ year Foreman, Transbay Terminal


It’s a no-brainer that this should be used on every construction project.

About Rhumbix — Rhumbix











































































Smarter. Safer. Workers First.Rhumbix continuously improves how the world is designed and constructed by empowering the workforce with technology that delivers value to workers first.



Two Lives. Parallel Paths. Same Destination.







The fabled Silicon Valley startup story usually begins in a garage, but for Rhumbix the story starts at a military base outside Djibouti City, Djibouti, during the Arab Spring of 2011. Co-founder Zach Scheel was serving as a civil engineer for the military. By day, he was managing large-scale construction projects, and by night, he stood watch in the Joint Operations Center monitoring more than 3,000 US troops using a technology called Blue Force Tracking that leverages GPS to monitor soldiers’ locations. The tool provided an extremely high level of visibility to military activity, which was in stark contrast with the paper time card system he was using during the day with his construction teams. A few years later Zach and Drew were both in Chile working on large infrastructure projects. Over beers in Santiago, they realized that even though their projects were different, the challenges they were facing with data collection and productivity were very much the same and could be solved if they had a tool like Blue Force to use on their projects. When they returned to the states, they officially founded Rhumbix and in a matter of months they had secured seed funding and completed a successful pilot.Rhumbix’s first prototype was created by soldering together off-the-shelf wearables to be worn by craft workers for our original POC. It’s still in our office today and serves as a great reminder of the roots from which our platform was born: mobile tools that help workers build smarter and safer. DREW DEWALTCo-founder and COODrew’s family has a rich military background. His father and older brother both served in the Air Force and Drew knew that he, too, wanted to serve his country. While an undergrad at Notre Dame, Drew enrolled in ROTC and upon graduation was commissioned into the Navy as a Nuclear Submarine Officer. He spent over 6 years with the Navy, stationed primarily in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and deployed to locations across Southeast Asia.  After his service was complete, Drew enrolled in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business to pursue a joint MBA/MPP degree program with a focus on energy systems and infrastructure. He interned at a few different energy companies while in school, and shortly after graduating started the renewable energy company, Valhalla Energia, in Chile with two classmates. ZACHARY SCHEEL, P.E.Co-founder and CEOZach joined the military a week after September 11th. He filled out a Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) application and enrolled at Duke University to study mechanical engineering. At the height of the Arab Spring, Zach was stationed in Djibouti, Africa, managing large-scale military construction projects. His other billets include serving as the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction and Assistant Public Works Officer at the Naval Station in Everett, WA. After completing his military service, Zach enrolled in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business where he interned with Bechtel as an Assistant Area Superintendent at the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, and Project Controls Engineer at a copper concentrator in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile.Meet the Team Construction 






Director of Business DevelopmentDuring ten years with Bechtel I built an airport in Qatar, motorways and bridges in Albania, aluminium smelters in Canada, refineries in Guinea and copper concentrators in Chile. I've had amazing exposure to some of the best people in construction and I am now hoping to leverage some of these experiences as we build out Rhumbix. I'm passionate about finding pragmatic solutions to ongoing industry challenges to move the needle on construction productivity.

In the startup world, we’ve seen a lot of examples of the importance of establishing and maintaining company culture. Uber’s recent crisis is, of course, the prime example of what happens when a corporate culture goes bad. But there are others who are praised for their intentional approach to culture,

When Rhumbix first started looking into the construction productivity problem, it became clear very quickly that timekeeping data was foundational to understanding labor productivity. Recently Guy Skillett, our Director of Construction Innovation, unpacked this topic on CONEXPO-CON/AGG Radio with host Peggy Smedley.
In this 15-minute interview, Guy touches on some of the original inspiration for the Rhumbix platform, why we chose timekeeping as our key measure for productivity and the other factors that play into successful adoption of field technology. What follows is a quick summary.

Co-authored by Burcin Kaplanoglu of Lendlease and Zach Scheel, CEO of Rhumbix, this insightful article originally appeared on Builtworlds.com.
From Burcin Kaplanoglu, VP and Operations Director of Telecommunications Infrastructure at Lendlease: I published an article on evaluating architecture, engineering, construction, and real estate (AEC/RE) technologies and shared the questions I ask from the customer’s point of view. In it, I challenged the way the companies work internally and with others to form partnerships, and highlighted the need to find new ways to do business.

The power of trust is one of the most valuable lessons I learned during my four years serving in the Marine Corp. It’s a huge, huge part of Marine culture and foundational to General McChrystal’s principles of Empowered Execution, pushing decision-making down to the lowest level; and Shared Consciousness, where information is shared with the right context so individuals can make good decisions faster.

A year ago, OSHA introduced a new rule to protect construction workers from the potential dangers of airborne crystalline silica on job sites. With the deadline for compliance approaching next week on June 23, 2017, it’s important for construction firms to have a clear plan in place for how they will remain compliant to the new standard.

Last week, Rhumbix hosted a panel discussion with Kris Lengieza, David Burns, Hitesh Dewan, and our very own Michael Myers on the challenges and opportunities of creating a data-driven culture. Moderated by Guy Skillet, Head of Construction Analytics at Rhumbix, we had over 50 attendees, many of whom had just wrapped up two and half days attending ENR FutureTech.
 Data was a key theme at the ENR event, and the panel provided a great opportunity to discuss more fully some of the ideas presented while still fresh in everyone's mind.

Part 3 of a series on the most common reasons construction firms don't adopt digital solutions.
When it comes to construction field technology, one of the big sticking points we hear is the requirement for field workers to actually use it. Every firm has their painful story of a system or process they tried—and that ultimately failed—at the field level. They believe foremen won’t want to use it; or they will think it's just another top-down initiative; or they will think it's just another thing keeping them from doing their most important work. 
But it doesn't have to be that way...

Smarter. Safer. Workers First.Rhumbix continuously improves how the world is designed and constructed by empowering the workforce with technology that delivers value to workers first.



Two Lives. Parallel Paths. Same Destination.







The fabled Silicon Valley startup story usually begins in a garage, but for Rhumbix the story starts at a military base outside Djibouti City, Djibouti, during the Arab Spring of 2011. Co-founder Zach Scheel was serving as a civil engineer for the military. By day, he was managing large-scale construction projects, and by night, he stood watch in the Joint Operations Center monitoring more than 3,000 US troops using a technology called Blue Force Tracking that leverages GPS to monitor soldiers’ locations. The tool provided an extremely high level of visibility to military activity, which was in stark contrast with the paper time card system he was using during the day with his construction teams. A few years later Zach and Drew were both in Chile working on large infrastructure projects. Over beers in Santiago, they realized that even though their projects were different, the challenges they were facing with data collection and productivity were very much the same and could be solved if they had a tool like Blue Force to use on their projects. When they returned to the states, they officially founded Rhumbix and in a matter of months they had secured seed funding and completed a successful pilot.Rhumbix’s first prototype was created by soldering together off-the-shelf wearables to be worn by craft workers for our original POC. It’s still in our office today and serves as a great reminder of the roots from which our platform was born: mobile tools that help workers build smarter and safer. DREW DEWALTCo-founder and COODrew’s family has a rich military background. His father and older brother both served in the Air Force and Drew knew that he, too, wanted to serve his country. While an undergrad at Notre Dame, Drew enrolled in ROTC and upon graduation was commissioned into the Navy as a Nuclear Submarine Officer. He spent over 6 years with the Navy, stationed primarily in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and deployed to locations across Southeast Asia.  After his service was complete, Drew enrolled in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business to pursue a joint MBA/MPP degree program with a focus on energy systems and infrastructure. He interned at a few different energy companies while in school, and shortly after graduating started the renewable energy company, Valhalla Energia, in Chile with two classmates. ZACHARY SCHEEL, P.E.Co-founder and CEOZach joined the military a week after September 11th. He filled out a Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) application and enrolled at Duke University to study mechanical engineering. At the height of the Arab Spring, Zach was stationed in Djibouti, Africa, managing large-scale military construction projects. His other billets include serving as the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction and Assistant Public Works Officer at the Naval Station in Everett, WA. After completing his military service, Zach enrolled in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business where he interned with Bechtel as an Assistant Area Superintendent at the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, and Project Controls Engineer at a copper concentrator in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile.Meet the Team Construction 






Director of Business DevelopmentDuring ten years with Bechtel I built an airport in Qatar, motorways and bridges in Albania, aluminium smelters in Canada, refineries in Guinea and copper concentrators in Chile. I've had amazing exposure to some of the best people in construction and I am now hoping to leverage some of these experiences as we build out Rhumbix. I'm passionate about finding pragmatic solutions to ongoing industry challenges to move the needle on construction productivity.
