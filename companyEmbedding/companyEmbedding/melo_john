John Melo
Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. Today I'll review our results for the first quarter, review the strategic and financial transactions we announced last week and provide our outlook for 2017.
I'll start with review of our results which Kathy will cover later in more detail. The first quarter was the fifth consecutive quarter where we more than doubled our product revenue over the prior year. We are very pleased with the performance of our products and partnerships and the strong demand we are continuing to experience for each of our products.
We have now introduced more than 10 products to date, that are each delivery more than $1 million in annual product revenue. And we have three brands that are on track from more than $10 million annual sales. We also have our first three [ph] molecule in pharmacy, where we expect our first molecule of $30 million or more in annual product sales this year and well on our way to $100 million in annual sales from that three molecules. We have the highest product revenue of any company in our sector and we are just started. Several of our competitors have indicated in their quarterly filings that they are struggling to get adoption or that they get weak demand from their customers. We are working hard to keep up with our customer demand with each of our key segments and each of our partners increasing their 2017 orders during the first quarter. I'll cover this in more detail and also provide more detailed guidance later during our call.

Our collaboration payments also remained strong over first quarter of 2016, but as we said before are choppy and not very predictable by quarter. Our partnerships and each payment have been consistent on a yearly basis and are a key differentiator for our business model over our competitors. We expect these payments to be slightly over the high end of our $50 million to $60 million range this year. These partnerships and their relative payments are a strong example of the market leadership we've demonstrated with our technology platform. We deliver solutions to our partner supply channels. A key partner mentioned to me in the last several weeks, you are our product innovation pipeline. We appreciate the trust our partners have in us, this trust comes from being the fastest to market with predictable timing and cost to engineer, scale and produce better products that deliver better economics and product differentiations to our partners.
This is very different than some of our competitors doing business with related companies and restructuring their contracts to drive revenue. Our collaboration revenue comes from market leaders where we are delivering products that help them gain competitive advantage and where we're both pointing [ph] to the value share arrangements in our collaboration agreements. After the quarter ended we announced our most material partnerships to-date in terms of alignment with our strategic direction and growth opportunities.
Our partnership with DSM includes production at world class -- at our world class fermentation factory, scaling strategic products and developing products for health and nutrition segments. This partnership is the direct result of our demonstrated market leadership in nutraceuticals and is structured to provide Amyris with a long term financial stability both our partners and investors are seeking. This is the most material partnership we've entered into since our IPO and in relationship with OPaL [ph] before the IPO.
We had referenced this partnership during our last call and this is a great example of the choppiness in our collaboration revenue. We expect it to close this quarter -- to close this deal before the end of the quarter. It took a month longer structure, this is more long term and very product focus. We will deliver the value we expected from this partnership starting later this year.
Our product sales increased 164% over the first quarter of 2016. Our product sales will deliver more revenue in our collaborations this year for the first time since we decided to exit the ethanol trading business and shift away from renewable fuels. We'll more than double product revenue this year to over $60 million and are on track to deliver over $160 million of product revenue in 2018 with most of this coming from current partners and products where we are experiencing significant traction.
Let me explain in more details the key drivers of our revenue of what you can expect. First, we recorded record quarterly Biossance sales following the grand successful launch into Sephora. Biossance is delivering high growth. Sephora told us this is one of the most successful independent brand launches they've ever experienced. This is the business that generated about $500,000 in total retail sales in 2016 and is on track for over $10 million this year and could be $20 million in retail sales for next year. This revenue has little impact on our production capacity. We enough production at straight lane to more than meet this retail revenue without any stress on current capacity.
We really like this business and it's fully in our control. It has excellent gross margins and it's making a real difference to the health of our customer's skin and the health of our plan. It's also an easy business to find the customer and I like that. The customer for this business is everyone over 20 years old that cares about healthy skin. We are just scratching the surface of the potential for this business. We are in less than 40 Sephora stores, we are in the sephora.com store, the vitalsignes.com store and have several shows on the home Shoppe network. Each of these channels is performing very well and our focus is additional reach to consumers through more channels and more doors.

As a result of our strong channel partnerships and early retail success we have one of the lowest marketing cost in skin care today. We are investing less than $0.40 for every dollar of revenue and have very strong customer loyalty re-purchase rates. Customers, consumer love our product and some of our products we can't make fast enough to keep in stock. We are making a product that truly does make your skin healthier. We are about real science behind the product and not just another brand store. Our history is about better help and access to the best treatments. This is a good example of the real impact of our technology.
The second big driver of product revenue growth is our pharmacy for use to make Vitamin E oil. This is a partnership we've entered in China and is performing better than all of us expected. This represents around $15 million of our increase in product revenue for 2017 over 2016. And it is as expected to represent over 30 million of 2018 product revenue. This is a great example of white cost leadership and product performance matters. Using [indiscernible] as the raw material to make Vitamin E results in over 30% cost advantage and better performing product and process than the alternatives.
This has provided our partner with a significant competitive advantage. Our partner has indicated a desire to purchase over 90% of our [indiscernible] production for the next two years as they expand their current capacity for Vitamin E oil. We are considering this [indiscernible] as we consider the highest value opportunities to use our existing manufacturing capacity. This is another critical point of the stipules about our business in comparison to many competitors.
We are an optimization and value driven business, not in volume and utilization business. We generate more revenue and create more value by using our limited capacity to make the highest value products and to access the best value share opportunities, not by making the most volume of a single molecule. We can generate anywhere from $50 million to $160 million in product revenue and value share using our current capacity based on the products we chose to make, and the amount of [indiscernible].
Our third value driver for us. Arc [ph] fragments and active cosmetic ingredient business continues to perform very well. We expect 50% to 60% revenue growth in this business this year and also the commercialization of three new products. This is our best year ever in terms of new products and a trend we expect to continue for the coming years. Our two existing products continue to perform better than expected and our customers continue to expand products in development with us.
In addition to our 2017 revenue as noted on our last quarterly call and in recent announcements we continue to execute on entering the $90 billion sugar market with healthy sweeteners that are focused on replacing sugar through our technology. Based on the progress of our development work, we expect industrial production of several leading healthy sweetener products in 2018. We believe we're on track to be the low-cost leader of natural white sweeteners with low calories that are substantial and naturally sourced.
We're excited about the partnerships in this segment and the early response from product testing. We expect this segment to represent over $50 million of 2018 product revenue. In addition to these products in our core focus markets our performance materials through Kuraray for the tire industry and through Novvi for industrial lubricants are also performing very well. Our Kuraray business will be doubled what we expected this year as a result of additional tire manufacturers adopting our liquid Farnesene rubber and the better than expected success from our fast tire partner launching. And finally, last week we took another significant step towards funded our company through sustainable self-funding and simplifying our balance sheet. The financing and debt reduction transactions to be detailed by Kathy was born out of Royalty SM approaching us with a desire to have access to our technology which supports DSM's strategic markets and help nutrition and materials.

For Amyris, DSM's channels, end market access and keen understanding in selecting the right products for the animal nutrition, human nutrition and consumer health markets provide significant strategic value. This new relationship is expected to be relatively similar to our partnership with Nenter where we've experienced quick success in growing with them in the nutrition market. We expect to replicate that success with DSM and leverage each other's key strengths to grow in a high growth global markets for animal and human nutrition as well as consumer health.
In summary, we're pleased to have put Amyris on much solid financial footing, in fact the strongest [indiscernible] the company has been on since our IPO and we have lowered our debt by one third while gaining the leading company in health and nutrition as a leading shareholder and strategic partner. So, now let me summarize. Product revenue matters, it is the indication of how well our strategy is working and the impact we can have on the health of the planet.
Our product revenue is predictable and is growing at a better rate than we expected; we are the leading product revenue generator in our sector and we're not having an issue with customers and consumers wanting our products. Collaborations are the key to our product success. Our partners select products that are strategic and provide them with competitive advantage. The revenue from collaborations is choppy quarter-on-quarter, but predictable over the full year. We've the leading product and partner portfolio in our sector and it is and has been delivering significant value.
The sweetener opportunity is the significant step up for Amyris. DSM is a deep strategic partner that understand and is the leader in health and nutrition markets. The sweetener business and the DSM partnership provide us with significant competitive advantage and can be the real difference maker for our technology platform having deep impact on the health of our clients. Our competitive advantage comes from having the leading technology platform in our sector; we designed and engineer chemistry for a healthier planet.
We use nature's biology to produce to deliver lowest cost products that are strategic to our product mix. We are establishing strong leadership positions in large markets that are probative in every day consumer lives. Our focus on healthy nutrition, personal care and performance material markets and our mission to make better products for healthier planet is starting to really deliver. Each of our key partners has increased their orders in the first quarter.
Now let me turn to Kathy for a detail review of our financial results and then I'll provide our outlook for 2017. Kathy?
Kathy Valiasek
Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to have recently announced some key strategic and financial transactions that we have mentioned on our last earnings call. This inquisitive series of agreements were up to 95 million in equity financing led by Royal DSM and including other investors, some of which have previously engaged in equity and/or debt investors in Amyris.
Tranche [ph] one of approximately 47 million closed this past Thursday and the second tranche of up to 48 million which is subject to approval by DSM's managing board is expected to close within ninety days of last week closing. This second tranche is also led by royal DSM and will include other investors. Of each closing DSM will gain one board fee. Since our last call we have improved our cash liquidity in our balance sheet and are in the process of reducing our debt by approximately 75 million, deploying less than about 20 million in cash to achieve the reduction. Aside from our term loans for our facilities we now have current maturities of approximately 6 million. Together with the debt reduction and the cash from the closing of tranche two we feel we are well on our way to sustainability.

Now let me take you through to our first quarter results following which I'll detail the financing we announced last week and how it effects and simplifies our adjustment capital structure. First quarter revenues were 13 million compared with 8.8 million for the first quarter of 2016. While collaborations were down somewhat due to the timing of inflows, the top line performance due to continued growth in product sales. Product sales were 8.3 million up 154% over 3.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. This increase was the result of Vitamin E sales which continue to ramp, liquid [indiscernible] shipments to our [indiscernible] as well as the shipment to one of our fragment partners and growth within our [indiscernible] related sales.
Collaboration revenues of $4.7 million were about $1 million lower than the year ago quarter due to the timing of milestone inflows and the delayed signing of new partnerships. We anticipate that Q2 2017 revenue will increase sequentially and quarter-over-quarter driven by anticipated strong product demand and milestone based recognition of [indiscernible] collaboration revenue. And we anticipate the same level of revenue ramp from Q2 through Q4 as we experienced last year.
Adjusted gross margin, which excludes depreciation inventory position and excess capacity charges was 1.3 million compared to an adjusted growth margin of 5.1 million to the same period a year ago. This was impacted by our need to run the [indiscernible] plant through what has historically been a seasonal shutdown period to the plant every year in Q1 due to the rainy season and at the same time the annual shutdown of the sugar mill adjacent to our plant. For the third time we needed to run straight through the season in order to maintain customer demand and ship on time. As a result the VHP [ph] molasses at higher cost than sugar were used in addition to higher cost incurred due to the rainy season.
We expect our adjusted gross profit and margins to dramatically improve for the second quarter as we're now out of the seasonal issue that impacted cost. I will also note that our anticipated balance share on products shipped in Q1 somewhat offset adjusted gross loss reported for the quarter as we achieved recognition for the value share.
For the first quarter of 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses were 12.8 million compared with 12.3 million for the same period last year. Here we continue to keep these expenses in check despite the 47% quarter-over-quarter increase in total revenue. This was offset by higher R&D expenses that came in at 14.8 million compared with 11.9 million for the same period last year due to collaboration activity with DARPA, Department of Energy and Ginkgo Bio works. Adjusted operating expenses representing combined R&D and SG&A expenses excluding stock based comp and depreciation and amortization were 24.1 million, this was up from 19.9 million for the year ago quarter primarily reflecting collaborations related R&D activity.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was 37.4 million or $0.13 per basic and dilute shared compared to the same period last year of 15.3 million or $0.07 per basic and $0.12 per diluted share. The significant driver of the quarter-over-quarter increase in net loss was tied to much lower gain from the change in fair value of derivative in Q1 of 2017, up 2.3 million compared with 21.7 million in Q1 of 2016. Adjusted net loss for first quarter 2017 excluding these items and stock based compensation was 38.2 million or $0.13 per basic share. This compared with an adjusted net loss of 34.7 million or $0.07 per basic share and $0.17 per diluted share for the same period a year ago.
Now let me take a moment to review our debt at March 31st as well as the impact of the tranche one financing and debt conversions that we announced this past Thursday. After that I'll take you through what we believe will be a much improved capital structure once we complete our planned second tranche financing.

As previously mentioned we have been able to reduce our debt significantly since our last call. In connection with [indiscernible] transaction we had convertible debt holders convert approximately 7.1 million from total amount of debt and also certain shareholders converted their loans to equity of 29 million in principle. Also since March 31st we had debt holders convert 24 million into equity at conversion prices ranging from $1.14 to $3.74.
Additionally, we paid cash of less than 20 million to the entire certain short term note. The net reduction in process related to these transactions totaled about 75 million or overall about 30% reduction in debt. We have also extended the term of one of our notes to 2018 in the amount of 3.7 million. [Indiscernible] term loan for our facilities we now have current maturities of approximately 6 million. The net significant debt maturity is not until Q4 of 2018. 
As we announced last week we closed of approximately 47 million in equity financing, 25 million coming from our new long term strategic partner DSM and 22 million from other financial investors. The transaction structure was fairly complex due to NASDAQ rules allowing for sale of equity at a discount in excess of 20% only with a shareholder vote which we expect to hold during the first week of July. The preferred stock holding and financing will be automatically converted to common stock within 90 days of shareholder approval. The transaction was priced at a 20% discount to market. Discount and used transactions that fairly typical, especially within our industry and given the recent volatility in our share price. Together with our anticipated revenue growth a cash from tranche one of our recent financing and the expected cash from tranche two and the progress we have made to restructure and reduce our debt, we feel that Amyris is now on a path to sustainability.
Looking forward we are encouraged by the progress we have made towards strengthening Amyris to create a better financial foundation for our rapidly growing company.
Now I'll turn the call back to John.
John Melo
Thanks Kathy. While we still have a lot of work to do we've made significant steps to solve legacy issues regarding our capital structure and our debt overhang. This will simplify our company, reduce interest expense and provide greater clarity to our stakeholders and partners that we engaged with on really moving forward to long term product innovation. This will also enhance our ability to continue our growth fast and to lead the company in the sector for 2017 and beyond. The [indiscernible] of our technology platform is known and our ability to mutually succeeded with our partners is evident by our strong relationships with partners like [indiscernible], DSM, [indiscernible] and many others. This reputation is why partners like Mentor and DSM have approached us and it has and will continue to support for the growth for Amyris.
Let me now turn to our outlook. Our product revenue has delivered five consecutive quarters of doubling year-on-year revenue growth and we expect this strong growth to continue and to be predictable. We expect product revenue for 2017 up over $60 million and over $160 million in 2018. We expect collaborations for 2017 to be in the high end of our $50 million to $60 million annual collaboration revenue range. The collaboration revenue is choppy and not predictable by quarter. That is expected for full year delivery for 2017. We expect total revenues of between 115 million and 125 million for full year 2017. This equates to over 100% product revenue growth over 2016 and another strong year of performance with our collaboration partners and the resulting payments from these partners.
For 2018 we expect total revenue to exceed 210 million. The majority of our product revenue growth between 2016 and '17 is derive from our sweetener [ph] products, Vitamin E oil, and the values share of our ingredients business. All of our other products are also growing, but have a less material contribution to our business. For 2018 we expect continued material growth from these key products. The additional benefit from the three new products we are launching this year in our ingredient business and the first year of product revenue from our sweetener business.

So in summary first we are demonstrating clear leadership in our sector. We're delivering material product revenue growth our competitors are not. Secondly our product revenue is predictable and our collaboration revenue is choppy quarter-on-quarter. We are the leading partner and product portfolio in our sector and year-on-year our collaborations are delivering. The best of our business model are value share components is just starting to drive cash for the company. We generated less than $1 million last year in value share, for 2017 we'll generate between $7 million and $10 million and for 2018 we expect $30 million to $40 million in value share. This is pure margin from the sharing of the cost benefits we delivered for our customers.
Thirdly, we now have three significant step out opportunities in our portfolio. Number one, our skin care line is delivering products consumers want, we are selling out our stock. It is a product line where we control our destiny. Second, Farnesene is delivering a real breakthrough molecule; it is on track to become our first $100 million molecule annually over time. Thirdly, key partner in health and nutrition with DSM. We are very excited about the depth of knowledge and the success they have had in the food and nutrition markets, connectively our best in class technology to combine for accelerate growth in this segment.
Lastly, we've the best cash position since our IPO and the lowest net debt that we've had in over three years, we're well positioned to be self-sustaining from a cash position and a much more attractive partner for our collaborators and investors, there is no other shoe to drop.
Thank you for your continued support and your continued help in making the world healthier. We've succeeded in [indiscernible] becoming a successful fuel -- renewable fuel company and now have the necessary traction to thrive and have the positive impact that we aspire for a healthier planet.
I'd now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Krystal can you help us?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sameer Joshi from Rodman and Renshaw. Your line is open.
Sameer Joshi
My first question is that you repeatedly made the comment that you're differentiated from -- and you've seen success in your products that your competitors have not. What do you attribute this to, like what is the reason that you're seeing success and whereas others are not being able to capture market share?
John Melo
I think it is early Sameer. So, I hope -- hold hope and I think the industry in the world needs all of our competitors to succeed in getting their products to market. I think our difference is, we've been doing this for ten years; we've over $1 billion invested in the company and we built a platform that is now a very predictable; we're not a single product company. We basically take what customers need for their business, we engineer it, we scale it and we produce it. The fact that we've a predictable platform, the fact that we're now engineering products for our customers in less than one year, at a cost that's less than $900,000 per molecule. Those two data points I think are step outs in our industry and we are not done yet. I mean there is still a long ways to go.
I think the other part is the factory, the fact that we can actually tell the customer, we are going to engineer, producing and deliver it to you is something no one else in the industry has been able to achieve. So I think the fact that the platform is what it is, its predictable, its low cost and delivers what customers want, and the fact that our factory can churn those products and deliver really takes us out of the group of competitors that I recall companies doing science experience and [indiscernible] companies that are actually delivering real commercial success.

If you look at product revenue, the only competitor that was even near us, was Intrexon and they delivered less product revenue than we did in the last quarter and they have flattened out with their product revenue. So I look at that and think that is a perfect example of a company to have lot of science, lots of experiments, with no real traction in delivery products to market.
Sameer Joshi
Speaking of production capacity, Brotas 2 was ground broken in January, can you give us an update on the progress of that build out?
John Melo
Sure than development is going very well. We are on track to have the plans completed build out by begin this 2018. I would expect in the fourth quarter of '18, I would expect first production in the first quarter of '19.
Sameer Joshi
And the outlook you have given for 2017 and some of it for 2018, it can all be achieved do you think the existing capacity at Brotas right?
John Melo
Yes, we will be using -- we are using this year a little bit and more next year, contract sites to meet all of our demand. So basically, when you think of it is contract sites will be a bridge to Brotas 2 in 2019. And we identified those and are already starting to detect trends for some of those contract sites.
Sameer Joshi
Just one more before I move on to the debt transaction. Can you give us an update on the noncore assets? Are you getting any revenues or generating any revenues from the "noncore assets" that you are holding for sale?
John Melo
One of the things that happened is one of those noncore assets, that we classified as noncore has become a significant revenue driver for us. So I would say the only noncore that we have now is already something that we have started bringing in other investors too and we will continue, which is really our [indiscernible] joint venture. And as a equate business we think lubricants are great future, especially the newer lubricants but we think our role in that business is purely as a supplier and we are seeing significant demand and interest from industrial companies wanting to invest and become partners in that business place. We did that already last year, we will continue to do that this year, and as a result we will continue to take down our ownership and just focus on being a supply for that industry.
Sameer Joshi
And you mentioned sweetener product do you think it will be introduce in 2018 and you will have some revenue from that in 2018?
John Melo
We expect about 50 million or so in revenue from sweeteners in 2018; that is a partner project so we're not saying that because we hope to fill the market ourselves, we actually are partnered with people who are very integrated with the market, have existing supply agreements and are help against to get the product soon and ensure that we're the best in class.
Sameer Joshi
Just so a clarification from Kathleen on the debt, so 75 million of debt is being reduced, only 20 million cash is being used, so roughly 65 million is converted or retired, how should we look at it that remainder 55 million?
Kathy Valiasek
55 million to 60 million is correct.
Sameer Joshi
And has it already occurred or is it -- will it occur after the 90 day second closing? Sorry elimination of --.
Kathy Valiasek
This is all already occurred.
Sameer Joshi
Oh, so the 75 million debt is either converted or repaid already?
John Melo
Correct, correct.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Jeff Osborne
Just a couple of questions, I'm trying to sum the numbers that you gave to get to the 60 million, So if I heard you right, for product revenue, you're talking about 10 million this year in Biossance revenue. 20 million, I think I heard you see in Vitamin E and then on the value share for ingredients, I think I heard 7 million to 10 million, so I think I'm missing $20 million to $25 million, can you just help me where would that be coming through?

John Melo
Yes, I'll give you the numbers, we've may have -- as giving you a little bit more ranges. So let me give you the big buckets, flavors and fragrances, 14 million and this is a purely product revenue right Jeff? So, flavors and fragrances 14 million, skincare around 20 million because you covered Biossance, but skincare includes Biossance and Neossance, where it's now called Afranova [ph] our JV with the Japanese, Nikkol Chemical. And then the Vitamins which is about 24 million for the year. So, before you get to any of our industrial products, you're in about 56 million in product revenue for '17.
And then the rest will get us bit over to 60 million because it's the polymers, the Kuraray, it's the Farnesene supplied to Novvi and then some other smaller businesses that we have, the major of them the 56 million really covers the heart of our business. Skincare, [indiscernible], and fragrance.
Jeff Osborne
And then I imagine it somewhat confidential, but the 50 million to 60 million in collaboration funding, can you just kind of go through in rank order the major partners to get that, obviously came in little lower than we were expect in Q1, you mentioned that the timing is difficult to predict, but can you just walk through who the top five guys are in kind of order or size or magnitude? And then just any color from modeling, if that's based on the milestones that you expect to achieve, do you think that's more back end loaded in the second half of the year or is there one big item next quarter, how should we be thinking about that please?
John Melo
Let me try to take you through it, and I want to highlight Jeff, we also more are bit disappointed. We had everything in place for what we expected in the first quarter and one of our partners Nikko Bioworks fails to make the milestone payment to us and that’s really the big difference we have in the first quarter. So from a delivery standpoint and a technology partnership standpoint we really did everything we expected in the first quarter.
Just wanted you to know that that, it's not because of a technical mix it's actually a failed payment that we are working through. But let me take you through what the top looked like, so think about Farnesene, DARPA, [indiscernible], Pure Circle and DSM being our five top collaboration generators and think about all of those being fairly needful. There is a couple outliers, but they are all north of 5 million with exception of couple of outliers.
Jeff Osborne
And then any thoughts on timing just from a modeling perspective should we backend load the year or did you have a line of side that maybe Ginkgo comes in 2Q and some other bigger chunky or checks?
John Melo
I would say fourth quarter is going to be good, but I think the second and third are going to be balanced and the second and third, one second Jeff, you could think of the second and third each around the 10-ish level in collaborations and then obviously a pretty big step out in the fourth quarter, really as we become really active with DSM.
Jeff Osborne
And then I know you highlighted that you produced for value and not units or utilization levels, but that being said, can you just talk about what the utilization is in Brotas currently? I think I heard you say you took in underutilization charge, but I just wanted to understand how you are looking at running the plant? And then also I have a curiosity how was -- I assume you switched over to Kane and no longer using molasses how was that change over in feed stock?
John Melo
I'll let Kathy talk about the utilization charge. Let me give you both answers how utilization is looking and then specifically what happened with the switch over to cane syrup. The utilization is, we are operating around the clock and getting as much up time as we can, the only time we are down on the plan is when we are switching from one molecule to another. And each molecule switch is call it on average about 10 days or so, five on the front five on the backend and that is to serialize a plant for running another molecule.

So that’s actually -- when we think about downtime of the plan it is all to do with molecule switching, I think obviously that matters a lot to us, molecules were switching too are very large revenue generators but not significant volume. But that’s point one is like when we run pharmacy we are running pharmacy at 80%, 90% up time. When we're running each molecule running that way what brings upside down our utilization is really when we switch molecules. So just keep that in mind.
I think for the question on the feedstock we've switched over to the syrup, everything we've seen so far in the switch has gone very well, back to what we expect. So I don't expect any major issues and as you've noticed sugar prices are back where they should be, so this should be a very good year for us as far as unit costs are in the -- or during the season.
Jeff Osborne
And then the -- Kathleen do you have a comment on the underutilization charge or so?
Kathy Valiasek
Well it's just say about quarter-over-quarter, so much less than it was in Q1 '16, [indiscernible] that as you said that we have to run full stop. So it was relatively small compared against 2016.
Jeff Osborne
And then the last one I had is just a clarification, the restatement of Q4 revenue, how much of that flow through in Q1 and if it didn't flow through in Q1, how do we think about that flowing through the P&L in 2017?
John Melo
It was zero in Q1 and that the numbers I gave you Jeff don't include any of that flowing through. I look at that as a bit of a gift; it's not something we had planned for and therefore the revenue that comes in from that will just be a move from what we had in '16 to '17. And we expect that adjustment to come through in the second quarter. It will be incremental to what I gave you as are view for second and third quarter collaboration revenue
Jeff Osborne
And that [indiscernible] again is 9 million to 10 million, in round numbers?
John Melo
It was 10 million.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions from our phone line. So, I'd now like to turn the conference over to John Melo for any closing remarks.
John Melo
Thank you, Krystal. We promised you in our last call that we expected to complete certain strategic and financial transactions that will have a material impact on our business. Well change is difficult at times, these subsets provided both capital, reduced the complexity of our capital structure, already reduced our debt by significant amount and improved our balance sheet. We've not yet started to communicate the commercial value of the relationship with DSM and that will be forthcoming as DSM and us work through the specifics on products time-to-market and what we will end up doing together. We could not be more excited and see it as a significant step forward for our company as well as a healthier planet.
I'd like to note that Amyris will be hosting its first Annual Biotech Summit tomorrow at our headquarters here at Emeryville. The summit includes -- will include investors, partners and key guest speakers and it promises to be an exciting event showcasing our Biotech is disrupting high growth markets. The primary portion of this event will be video cast live and we hope many of you'll have a chance to view the program we've planned.
In closing I'd like to especially thank our partners and our investors for their key support in aligning Amyris on its mission to support a healthier planet for sustainable better performing products. Thanks again and have a great afternoon.

I would also like to note that references to record revenue and product sales in our remarks excludes historical periods when the company had engaged in ethanol sales and trading.
I'll now turn the call over to John Melo. John?
John Melo
Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our call. I'm pleased to have Kathleen Valiasek, our new CFO with us today. For those of you we haven't met her already, she brings a highly regards of skill set critical to taking our business to the next level of growth. Kathy is focused on delivering on our business outlook and is already helping us drive top-line results and improved margins in balance sheet.
Today I will review our results for the quarter and the year, review key fourth quarter deliverables that help accelerate our flow, update you on our business plans and business model going forward, and provide a high level outlook for the years ahead.
Let's start with our results. We completed a record year by more than doubling our revenues over 2015. Having signed a record number of new global partners and delivered on the 2016 strategic milestones we communicated to you. As a result and excluding historical periods we engaged in ethanol sales and trading, we posted record revenues in both collaborations and product sales. In fact, our revenues of $33.2 million marked our second consecutive quarter of achieving record revenues which also help underpin record revenues of $77.2 million for 2016 overall.

In addition to the selected revenue performance, we had $3.8 million of additional sales in our health and nutrition business that we did not have capacity to produce and ship in the fourth quarter and have subsequently shipped in the first quarter.
We achieved this growth while significantly growing our gross margin and lowering our SG&A costs by 15% for the year. We believe the combination of this revenue growth, margin performance, and cost performance is the leading performance in our sector today.
During the fourth quarter, we sold 50% of our cosmetic ingredient business to Nikko Chemical for $20 million and formed a joint venture with them. This is in the form of $10 million upfront with the remaining $10 million structured as an earn-out. This business was a business that did not exist four years ago and we built into one of the fastest growing cosmetics ingredient businesses in the sector. This business represented less than 10% of our 2016 revenue and we will be consolidating this into Amyris financials going forward. Nikko is our leading distributor in Asia for cosmetic ingredients and we are already benefiting from their expertise as our new joint venture partner. We are extracting accelerated growth with their partnership and financial support for this business.
During the quarter we will also very pleased to announced Chevron's equity investment in our Novvi Joint venture for high-performance renewable base oil technology which is strategically aligned with Chevron's aggressive growth plan in lubricants. This is another good example of the quality and value of the businesses we built. The Novvi business is currently valued at around $100 million and we continued to have a 30% ownership share while also being the key raw material supplier and a long-term furnishing supply arrangement to Novvi.
In the area of biopharma, we are executing well on all three collaborations with top mobile companies in their respective areas. On one of these we achieved a key milestone a major drug discover collaboration with this leading company, delivering initial development work for new oncology drug development in just months. Our partner is very impressed that we completed in months where commonly takes years. This performance is well beyond their expectations.
All of our collaborations performed well in the fourth quarter. And we were pleased during the December to announce a multiyear extension to our collaboration agreement with Kuraray for the use of Amyris Biofene in liquid farnesene rubber and farnesene-based elastomer applications. Kuraray recently announced that Sumitomo Rubber Industries has adopted liquid farnesene rubber as a performance enhancing additive for use of the production of its latest winter tire, the Winter Maxx 02. Kuraray has indicated tire launch has performed better than expected. They have already indicated double the demand than we expected for 2017. We believe Sumitomo is the first of what could be several global tire brands that end up using liquid farnesene rubber as a performance enhancing tire additive.
Many of you have asked about the status of the MOU we announced October 13, 2016, with a leading Global Food Ingredients and Nutraceuticals Partner. We have advanced to a signed contract resulting in $10 million in 2016 revenues for licensing agreement related to the MOU. After completing an evaluation we decided that a share swap for ownership in their China fermentation facility was not the best use of our equity and not the best way for us to create shareholder value.
Let me now update you on our strategy, our business plan, and our business model. We are leading the industrialization of the synthetic biology and we believe have developed an advantage business model that more than double our revenue in 2016, and expect to more than double our revenue, product revenue in 2017, and continually improve our gross margin. We are applying innovative science to make our planet healthier, both the planet itself and the people on it. We are doing this by making high performing where chemistry accessible to everyone. We are the lowest cost producer of some of the most desired chemistry by the world's leading companies in their respective segments. We are achieving the Holy Grail for our customers of producing the lowest cost, highest quality, and pure the material they can source. We are making it plentiful and at stable prices without volatility. We have succeeded in scaling and meeting our customers' targets for all the products we develop with our collaboration agreements to-date.

We have a clear pipeline to scale three to four products a year over the next five to ten years. As a result of the traction we are experiencing and the clarity of our business model we made the following strategic moves. First, we are focusing our efforts on collaborations and expanding our relationships with existing partners. This is a solution oriented approach for customers' business challenges and is all about deep customer intimacy and a very focused analytical approach to a few targets in each of our key sectors. This has resulted in us reducing our exposure, some of our product selling efforts, and as you have seen through the Nikko joint venture, and reducing our position in Novvi joint venture. We will remain a key supplier to these businesses but the sales capability and channel management will be in the joint ventures or with our partners.
We are managing our business by focusing on three clear market sectors when we have the most advantage technology, clearly and extensive product pipeline, and some of the leading companies in these sectors as partners.
Our three sectors are health and nutrition, health and nutrition represented 38% of 2016 revenue and grew 2,000% over 2015 revenue. In health and nutrition, we have the biopharma business, which is partnered with the three of the world's leading pharma companies, the vitamin business which is all about Vitamin E and Vitamin A, and the sweeteners business which is all about a sugar replacement which is really playing into a $90 billion market opportunity when we have advantage technology.
Second sector is the personal care sector where it delivered 50% of our 2016 revenue and grew 85% over 2015. In personal care, we have fragrances which are partnered with Firmenich, Givaudan and Takasago. We have flavors which are partnered with Firmenich and Givaudan. We have cosmetic access that have partnered with Givaudan and our new joint venture partner Nikko.
Our next last segment is performance materials. Performance materials represented 12% of 2016 revenue and excluding fuels grew by 20% over 2015. The renewable fuels part was 30% of our total revenue in 2015 and less than 1% of our total revenue in 2016.
Now on to our third point over 80% of our revenue is generated from our top 10 customers. As we look ahead to 2020 and beyond this profile improves to about 90%. We have a partnership model where we enable significant competitive advantage for our partners and share in the value this creates long-term. We do real business with our partners and deliver real solutions that generate revenue today and will into the future. We are not building a portfolio of bets that we hope someday deliver revenue.
We apply -- our fourth point; we apply our innovative science where customers have identified a clear product target. The target is replacing a supply source from an existing market that is well understood and is growing faster and current supplies and support from either a volume or pricing perspective. Partners pay us to develop. They identify a cost and quality target that enables significant competitive advantage for them. We develop, we scale, and produce the product, and they formulate, integrate, and deliver to the final customer. When customers have skin in the game they select products that really matter to them and they ensure these products generate significant value. We both win. We Amyris don't have research, product selection, or market risk and our partners grow market share at a lower cost.
I could point we double down where we believe our technology is delivering best-in-class performance and where we view the market opportunity justifies investment beyond the partner funding. The high intensity sweetener market is a good example. We have successfully made a high intensity sweetener from non-TMO Brazilian sugarcane syrup that is 200 times sweeter than sugar without the calories and with visibility on achieving cost equivalency with sugar. We are currently achieving cost in this product that are in line with the purest molecules available from Stevia but without the supply limitations. We are doing this security levels that don't have the typical after taste from these type of products. Some of the world's leading soda companies have told us this is the Holy Grail of sweeteners. We are very excited about this product in our pipeline and our partner on this project is collaborating with us to get this product into the brands and make the world healthier for all. We believe the opportunity for this product is to replace or reduce sugar and we believe this opportunity has available market at about $45 million or think of it as about half the current global sugar market.

These five strategic segments are being executed today inside of Amyris and were key to our revenue and margin performance in 2016. This continued strong growth is only starting to our business and our partners.
Our business model has been a key enabler in growing our collaborations and providing short-term cash, short and long-term revenue growth, and long-term gross margin expansion. The three components of our business model are first collaborations; our partners fund the development of key ingredients to support their business strategy. This funding more than pays for our R&D organization and provides us early cash cover as we scale products for a propose. This is our early margin and cost advantage. We generated over $50.8 million in partner payments in 2016 and expect to maintain the strong performance level in our collaboration revenue for the next three to five years which is consistent with our previously stated levels of annual collaboration revenue.
Second component, we produced and sell the products we develop through our partners. In general, we sell most in a small margin to ensure our long-term sustainability.
And the third component, we have a value share mechanism where our partners share a portion of the value created from our products. The combination of the value share and the initial product margin generate over 60% gross margin at steady state production that means after it's scaled and stable in the market for a year, for the personal care and health and nutrition sectors and around 30% margin for the performance material sector. With a record of new partners contracted in 2016 the extensive pipeline of products with these partners and the continued expansion of products with our existing partners, we now have over 90% of our expected revenue through 2020 supported by our current customer relationships and product portfolio.
In 2016, we transition as a company for meeting more demand to be in sold out and needing to execute a clear production capacity roadmap to keep up with our customers' needs. We have developed this production roadmap and we are in a position to keep up with our customers' needs through a combination of partner funded and supported projects and BNDES project financing in Brazil. We will continue to have challenges like the fourth quarter, where we have $3.8 million more in sales than what we could share.
We believe this is manageable and a good problem to have. In summary, we are proud of our 2016 results and expect 2017 will be another great year for Amyris with more than doubling of product revenue while maintaining our strong collaboration performance. We also plan to continue to improve our balance sheet and post improved product margins as cost improvements and as our value share payments continue to grow.
Now let me turn to Kathy for a detailed review of our financial results and then I will end with a high level outlook for the company.
Kathleen Valiasek
Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. After my first two weeks here at Amyris, I'm truly excited by the opportunities ahead of us and quite compressed by the level of commitment our customer have to Amyris and how critical our technology is to their business. It's rare to experience the level of the tendency, our customers had on our technology together we had a mutually successful relationship.
Amyris has embarked on an era of significant growth across its business, we are executing on our plan to effectively harness it, to grow our company, and build shareholder value. This is creating unprecedented demand for new partners and the potential expansion with existing partners. With the positive cycle that is building on a great track record of success in scaling and delivering products to our customers that have a positive impact on their bottom-line. This impact is why we are constantly being approached by leading companies to solve their supply chain problems and at times consider interesting strategic transactions. More on this later when John provides color on our outlook.

All of this is aligning to support increased revenues and our ability to operate from a position of strength in running our business and executing on improvements in our balance sheet and capital structure.
Now let me take you through our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter revenues were $32.2 million and were up 227% over $9.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. As a testament to the strength in our portfolio this performance was driven by both product sales and collaborations growth over the prior year's quarter.
Product sales of $11.5 million were up 119% over $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. This was driven by growth across our three focused sectors, personal care, performance materials, and health and nutrition. In health and nutrition the key driver of this growth were farnesene shipments in Denver for Vitamin E and in our personal care business shipments of our second Fragrance Molecule during the quarter and continued strong performance of our cosmetic ingredients business and our cosmetics active partnership with Givaudan.
Significant quantities of farnesene were also shipped to our joint venture partner Novvi for base oils and lubricants in the Kuraray for liquid farnesene rubber or LFR in car tires. Going into 2017, we are seeing stronger than experienced demand from Kuraray due to request from their customers and we feel the adoption of LFR by other tire companies is a key growth opportunity for Amyris.
Collaboration revenues of $20.8 million were driven by the aforementioned $10 million related to MOU related partner actually $5 million from hitting a milestone with DARPA and the reminder from Biogen, Firmenich, and the Global Food Ingredients supplier we announced collaboration with in July of 2015. Collaboration revenues were up 350% over $4.6 million for fourth quarter of 2015.
In line with increasing demand we continue to work diligently to solve our capacity constraints because clear roadmap for continued expansion supported by our partners and in the near-term assets to financing the BNDES in Brazil for a planned build-out of a dedicated flavors and fragrances plant adjacent to our Brotas plant.
Adjusted gross profit which excludes depreciation, inventory provisions, and excess capacity charges was $13.2 million up from about $6,60,000 for Q4 2015. Adjusted gross profit benefited from a significant component of high margin collaborations revenue during the quarter as well as a favorable product mix especially given just under 150,000 in fuel sales during the quarter as we fully transitioned our business away from commodity products. Adjusted gross margin showed a significant improvement at 41% compared to just under 7% for Q4 2015. This will continue to improve as we benefit from less scale of a cost in our cost of goods sold for new molecules and the continued growth in the value shared component of our business model.
Operating expenses -- excuse me, such a large increase in total revenues for the fourth quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $12.7 million declined slightly compared to the same period last year. R&D expenses increased to support our collaborations activity.
Adjusted operating expenses representing combined R&D and SG&A expenses excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization were $43.1 million. This primarily reflected investment in R&D supporting a diversity of new collaborations in 2016 and was up from $20.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $38.8 million or $0.14 per basic and diluted share. Included in the net loss were several non-cash items including a gain from changes in fair value of embedded derivatives and impairment losses. These items totaled $12.7 million. This compared with a reported net loss of $41.9 million or $0.23 per basic and $0.28 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2015 which primarily included an impairment charge of $26.9 million which was offset by a gain on fair value of derivatives of about the same amount.

Adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 excluding these items and stock-based compensation was $26 million or $0.09 per basic share. This compared with an adjusted net loss of $34 million or $0.19 per share for the same period a year ago.
During the fourth quarter we successfully closed on the $25 million unsecured credit facility and an additional $5 million in equity funding from Nectar, our nutraceuticals partner which is converting our farnesene into Vitamin E. We also completed our Neossance asset divestment via our Nikko joint venture and received $10 million from Nikko ex-closing with the remaining $10 million expected to be paid over three years on the remaining cash profits contributed to Nikko from the JV.
In addition, Nikko provided working capital from the JV of $1.9 million. These are both great examples of how our pipelines have become critical partner funding needs in the short and medium-term. There is a strong co-dependency in the relationship with our partners as our technology that comes critical enabler of their business.
We are experiencing this type of support and expansion of our partners' portfolio. This is another great example of our technology leadership in our sector. We have mentioned on prior calls our desire to support partner generated financing where possible, when cash is needed to fund working capital to grow the business, which we have accomplished. This aligns our partners' interest even more so with our long-term focus when equity financing is involved puts the ownership in long-term loyal hands ahead of vested interest from a variety of standpoints in making sure our business does well.
These activities during the fourth quarter generated a significant amount of cash, leading to cash and restricted cash totaling $33.8 million at December 31, 2016. This is the highest level since Q1 2015.
Just before the end of the quarter we entered into a definitive agreement to complete another milestone we promised by resolving our near-term debt maturity issue by pushing 23.9 million of debt out which we completed in January of 2017. This included 15.3 million of notes previously due March 2017 but is now extended to April 2019. In addition 28.6 million senior secured debt held by Stegodon Corporation via our partners Ginkgo Bioworks previously due February 2017 has been extended to October 2018. This has greatly improved our near-term liquidity and puts Amyris in significantly better position to continue to improve our capital structure. This is not the last step but really the most recent in improving our balance sheet.
In 2016 Amyris set the stage for success and delivered. Today our business portfolio is strongly positioned and highly diversified and growing at a rapid cliff. Looking forward I am even more excited by the growth opportunity at top before joining the company. This opportunity is ours to win and we are on a positive role and simply need to execute to deliver another great year for 2017.
Now I will turn the call back to John.
John Melo
Thanks, Kathy. In 2016 we fully transitioned our business beyond biofuels while delivering record revenues for the year. We delivered on all of our milestones and positioned the company for continued strong revenue growth. Today I can say that I have never been more confident in our competitive position and I believe we will continue to role at about the current rate with the existing partners and the product portfolio they have contracted us to develop and produce for them.
During the fourth quarter we saw several new and exciting strategic opportunities develop for the company from potential partners who approached us as a result of the competitive advantage we demonstrated in key markets. We are in very active discussions and expect one of these relationships to advance during the second quarter. This will have a material positive impact on our short-term results and is expected to provide us with the necessary resources to further accelerate our growth.

Let me summarize our high level outlook. First, we ended the year with over $100 million annual revenue run rate and we expect to continue the current level of growth for 2017.
Secondly, we communicated the framework of doubling product revenue annually and maintaining our strong performance in collaborations. We are on track to deliver more than doubling product revenue in 2017 and maintaining our framework for collaboration revenue and are happy to report there are current customers and product relationships support more than 90% of this product revenue growth.
Thirdly, our business model and sales strategy is clear and focused around three core sectors: health and nutrition, personal care, and performance materials. This is where our growth is coming from and we can continue to deliver strong growth while lowering our margins in these markets with our current product and customer portfolio.
Fourthly, we are in very active discussions with several significant strategic growth opportunities for one of these core segments. Successful completion of one of these relationships will have a material positive impact on our revenue growth and balance sheet. We believe that we are the only company in our sector that has now successfully developed and scaled several products for our customers and is delivering significant revenue and margin growth from these products. We executed on delivering on our key objectives for 2016 and are on track for another great year in 2017. We are doing real business with customers representing leadership in each of our target sectors. This is delivering real revenue growth while having a positive impact on the health of our planet and making accessible amazing chemistry for use in mainstream products. The total available market for our target sectors in current product portfolio is about $200 billion.
That more than underpins our growth base on being the advanced technology in many of these opportunities. I would like to thank our teams in Emeryville and Brazil, our investors and our partners for making such a great year possible and ultimately supporting the mission of Amyris. We are delivering the leading performance in our sector, record revenue growth, declining costs, and the leading partner portfolio to support the strength of sustainability of our company.
We have industrialized synthetic biology and have become a force for good for our partners and our planet.
I would now like to open the lines for any questions, you may have. Keith, can you help us.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely sir. [Operator Instructions].
Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Boyes of Cowen and Company. Your question please.
Thomas Boyes
Yes just a couple of quick questions from me. The first we have seen an uptick in branding for your cosmetics and I was just wondering how we could think about OpEx trends going forward given those efforts?
John Melo
We don't have Kathy jump-in on this. We do not see a significant OpEx change in our side specifically for that business we are dependent on our channel partner who is doing a terrific job Sephora. And based on what we've seen in the first quarter which has been a great result so far, we expect to not see again a significant change. Kathy, anything?
Kathleen Valiasek
No, I completely agree, last year with [indiscernible] was ramping up costs, I would say in OpEx but now I feel as John said that because of Sephora we will be able to be fairly flat with OpEx in Biossance for 2017.
Thomas Boyes
Got it. And then just the last one, just given some of the expansion commentary that you had, I was wondering in broad terms you could talk about the Brotas facility and may be some of the utilization rates are around that what we should think about that going forward?

John Melo
Sure the Brotas facility is pretty hard to ever consider exit to utilization rates because of the way we are operating it today. Right it's basically we are switching from products to make sure we can deliver our customers the lowest cost possible for the products they are looking for. As a result when are we operating a specific product whether that's making farnesene, making tool, making spirit all, making whatever we decide to make there, the utilization and the up time for those cycles is outstanding. What happens though is every time we switch we're actually down for that period of time. So that the net impact is that we are probably under utilizing the site by 20% to 30% that's possible there because of these switch-outs in product.
I think Kathy referenced we have a design now in place. We've actually already broken ground on a second site that will be a purpose built site for our ingredients business, for the flavors, for the cosmetics, and for the fragrance ingredients and also the health products. And I think with that site us running, the growth is one all-out. We will be in the mid 80s to up or 80% utilization of the site which is exactly what we would expect for site of that type.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Dayal of Rodman & Renshaw. Your line is open.
Amit Dayal
Thank you and good afternoon John and Kathy. How are you guys.
John Melo
Very good, Amit. Good to hear you.
Amit Dayal
Just wanted to clarify your comments on this nutraceutical customer. You said the MOU didn't translate into definitive agreement yet, we're supplying product to could you clarify what the situation is and if we can expect revenues from this nutraceutical customer in 2017?
John Melo
Yes, I would expect different revenue profile then we had communicated in the MOU and the MOU we had said there is going to be revenue but there is going to be no margin and overtime we'll improve the products and hopefully get to margin. Actually as a result of where we ended up the discussion I expect we will have short-term revenue but that revenue will be profitable and will be about products that accord their business rather than just a pass-through for our business.
Amit Dayal
Got it. And how this, the $10 million was all bracketed under product revenues from these guys?
John Melo
No, if we say license fee so it will be in the collaboration dollar market.
Amit Dayal
Understood. I may have missed this. I know you provided some color on the capacity expansion plans. Did you give a number on what the CapEx or investment going into some of these efforts are going to be?
John Melo
I think Kathy can talk to this. Our -- the funding for the site will be a combination of a partner funding as well as BNDES debt and the total funding between the two will be somewhere around the $70 million range. But again we're looking to finalizing that. But the important message is we're not expecting that to be either a new equity or direct funded outside of the Amyris balance sheet or inside our balance sheet. Kathy?
Kathleen Valiasek
Yes. I think you grow faster recently had a meeting with them and I know that went very well we broke ground, and it's a great facility to finance the stability.
John Melo
Great. Something we have not spoken a lot about the business case based on the products we expect to transfer into that site because frankly those are products either doing now at Brotas 1 or what we'll doing this year or in the next couple of years at CMO. So we're basically transferring stuff we are making and will be making. When you put the products inside of our plant, Brotas 2, we have about a one year or less payback on that site. So we have not had a big issue with the level of interest, people participating in that site, what they have been very focused on is making sure we have the right long-term partner so that we're maximizing value from that site Brotas 2.

Amit Dayal
Understood. In relation to the blended gross margin you are seeing now with this level of revenue mix. Should we continue to expect you know these 30% plus sort of margins going forward if collaboration in product revenues. Can you remain at similar levels going forward?
Kathleen Valiasek
Yes, we absolutely do. As John described in a little bit more detail on our call today we value share our business model which includes the value share at the end really makes a significant difference on our gross margins. And the truth of it is in 2016 -- in 2015 we really didn't see it very much, in 2017 it's extremely impactful. I mean the actual that we would say for 2015 was $838,000 and that's for 2016 and then 2015 was around $400,000 but in 2017 it's significant.
Amit Dayal
Got it. And just may be a last question for me John you commentary around some of these strategic discussions you are having with potential catalyst coming up in the second quarter, is this just one discussion you are having or these multiple discussions you are having and one of them could materialize in the second quarter?
John Melo
We are in multiple discussions, it's a competitive parcels for multiple companies are looking at the same market area and the kind of scale that we are talking about is very material for us as a company. Right I expect there will be one because we are talking to multiple about the same end markets and it will be a very material agreement for our company.
Amit Dayal
Understood. I was thinking of it in line with maybe separate discussions for may be different product lines or molecules et cetera but it looks like it's just one of sort of initiative with a multiple discussions around that one project I guess, is that correct?
John Melo
Yes. To give you some color, I mean we obviously have many more pursuits and discussions going on in kind of the normal course of business and I'm not highlighting those leaving those, it's just our activity to deliver on our growth for the year. This particular one I'm referencing these are several strategics that have approached us about a specific opportunity in our portfolio that is now in market that is quite strategic for those companies. So that's why I'm referencing first of all highlighting it.
Secondly referencing it and then also making clear that the result is that we're going to end up with four, five new players around that particular segment that we are actually doing it yield for one of these two, to be the right partner, to be the right partner selected to be able to operate with us in this particular product area.
Amit Dayal
Understood. And this is not factored into any of your guidance right?
John Melo
No. We actually that's one reason and we debated this a lot. One reason why we decided not to really go change or make a big deal out of guidance for 2017 until we get this deal done and then we can actually update pretty complete what the guidance looks like going forward in more detail.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Springer of Singular Research. Your question please.
Lisa Springer
Good afternoon John and Kathy and congratulations on a nice growth for the year.
John Melo
Thanks, Lisa.
Kathleen Valiasek
Thanks.
Lisa Springer
Regarding the revenue breakdown you gave us for 2016 with the contributions from health and nutrition, personal care and performance materials, are you expecting those to change significantly in 2017 or should we anticipate a very similar revenue breakdown?
John Melo
The 2000% in health and nutrition was pretty outstanding right. So I'm not sure.
Lisa Springer
Yes.
John Melo
But I think that kind of mixed and obviously health and nutrition really leading growth is something you can expect in 2017.
Lisa Springer
Okay. And the assumptions a little bit that you gave about product sales for 2017, is that based on a ramp up of products you are already producing or do you expect there is going to be new products to go into production in 2017?

John Melo
Yes, there are three new products coming into production in 2017. Those are not having a material impact in total revenue in 2017. I think about the majority of the product revenue in 2017 are products we started selling in 2016. We are working for this. But 2016 products we started in 2016 are having the most material impact in revenue for 2017.
Lisa Springer
Okay. Okay and the sweetener you referenced in the call, I wonder if you could give us a little more color around that in terms of where that is in terms of the development timeline.
John Melo
We are planning an Investor Day around our Annual Meeting here in Emeryville and during that we are going to actually share quite a bit. What I can tell you is obviously I said during the call that we are producing it now at about the same cost as the plant material. We think that the real tipping point to convert the sugar market into high intensity sweeteners is being priced competitively with the sugar equivalent and we believe that in the next 12 to 18 months we will actually be at exactly that price level.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions].
Our next question comes from the line of Carter Driscoll of FBR. Your line is open.
NateMitchell
Hey this is Nate Mitchell on for Carter. Thanks for taking my questions. First question related to working cap, I understand the strategy is to source this from partners but how much do you think, how much working cap do you expect for the business to need on a of percentage basis how much would you expect that to come from your partners?
John Melo
Tough question meaning we haven't thought of it that way, but I'll give you sort of a -- give you a way to think of it which is our -- we had a huge ramp in 2016. I think because of the way the cycle the total product cycle is built-in, we don't expect that same kind of ramp in 2017 for working capital and I would say that over half of what we expect in 2017 will be partner based funding for working capital.
NateMitchell
Okay, thank you. I mean kind of building off of Lisa's question, how do you expect there is three buckets in terms of percentage revenue health and nutrition, personal care and materials, in the longer-term talking two, three, five year how do you see those evolving overtime do you see one kind of taking over just any additional color on there would be great?
John Melo
Sure, if I can you give you around 2020 so not going way far out but around 2020 you could think about around 2020 about 40%, 40% to 45% coming out of health nutrition, about 30% to 40% out of personal care, and then the rest divided between collaboration revenue and performance material that kind gives you the sense of shape as we look at the business growth going forward.
Nate Mitchell
Awesome. That's all I had for now. Thanks guys.
John Melo
Great. Thank you
Operator
Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call over Mr. Melo for any closing remarks sir.

Well, Keith, thank you very much. I appreciate your help, like to thank everyone for joining our call today and your support of Amyris. We are really looking forward to 2016 and obviously already off to a great start. I like to note that will be participating number of investor outreach activities in the coming months to meet with investors and share our story and we hope to have a chance to meet with many of you as we do that and again as I said in May, during our Annual Meeting we except to turn the Annual Meeting to much more of a shareholder and investor engagement of that. We expect to have a few guest speakers including some of our customers and really to get into a lot more detail about our sectors, customers behind those sectors, and how our business is growing. So I hope to see many of you at that time. Thank you very much and look forward to see you in the near future.
