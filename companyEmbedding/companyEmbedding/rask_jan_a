Moneymakers: Jan Rask
Drilling work in the Gulf moves to smaller companies


Copyright 2004 Houston Chronicle


        Published 6:30 am, Wednesday, December 29, 2004
    



































































Jan Rask came to the United States in 1990 from his native Sweden, expecting to stay not more than two or three years. Now he is heading up his third offshore oil and natural gas drilling company as president and chief executive of Todco.
Houston is a Mecca for this type of business. Todco, which used to be part of Transocean, went public early this year.
Todco owns 70 drilling rigs, with 53 operating in the United States, and has about 2,000 employees. The company boasts the nation's largest fleet of inland drilling barges and the second-largest fleet of jack-up rigs.

The barges are designed for drilling in shallow water, basically the swamps of Louisiana, and to a lesser extent in Texas. The jack-up rigs can work in shallow waters as well, up to 150 or 250 feet. Rask talked to reporter Nelson Antosh about this important business in Houston.
Q: What's the future for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico?

A: The Gulf is a place we have been drilling in for many years; it is a mature basin. In the past 20 years we have seen a gradual trend from the larger oil companies to the smaller oil companies taking over, and I think that will continue.
Obviously, the reserves are getting smaller and smaller. The larger oil companies really can't put their resources on something that may generate 4 or 5 billion cubic feet of gas. The smaller guys can do that.
They have to be on a treadmill and do it all the time, but their returns are just great.
Q: Who are you working for there?

A: Nine out of 10 of our customers are independents, and of those we work for, half are established public companies, and the other half are smaller private companies.
There are a lot of names you probably wouldn't know,
and I didn't know either three or four years ago.
Q: What's the outlook for the jack-up type of drilling rig?

A: That market is actually very strong worldwide; it doesn't matter where you look.
Some of the markets have strengthened because supply has diminished, like the United States and also the North Sea.
You've seen almost 50 jack-ups leave the U.S. Gulf in the past 3 1/2 years. That's why the day rates have increased as much as they have. The international markets have been strong enough to absorb all of these rigs.
Q: What's the zooming price of natural gas done for the business?

A: The returns for the oil companies are just phenomenal with the natural gas price where it is today. We can see day rates increase to what I call the replacement cost, where it actually makes sense to build rigs, and we haven't seen those kinds of day rates since we built all these rigs in the early 1980s.
Natural gas prices have come up to around $6 per thousand cubic feet, when actually we just need to see $4 to $5 gas. We can charge replacement-cost day rates, and it still makes sense for our customers.
Q: What's happened to the inland barge business?

A: In 2001, we had well into 40 barges working in the United States, and today it is down to around 30. The natural gas price collapsed, and some of the bigger players in the inland waters quit drilling. ChevronTexaco used to be a big player there, but not anymore.
We are waiting for two things to happen. The first is we are waiting for them to sell their leases to the smaller players. The second is we are waiting for the deep gas play to take off. You've probably heard about the deep gas play in the Gulf, but there is a deep gas play in the inland waters as well. We are talking about drilling beyond 15,000 feet.
