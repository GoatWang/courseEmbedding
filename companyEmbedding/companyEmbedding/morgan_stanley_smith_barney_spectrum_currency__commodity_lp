Organization
1.��OrganizationMorgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P. ("Spectrum Currency"), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P. ("Spectrum Global Balanced"), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P., ("Spectrum Select"), Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P. ("Spectrum Strategic") and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. ("Spectrum Technical") (individually, a "Partnership", or collectively, the "Partnerships") are limited partnerships organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of futures contracts, options on futures and forward contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products (collectively, "Futures Interests") (refer to Note 6. Financial Instruments).Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acts as the general partner ("Ceres" or the "General Partner") and commodity pool operator of the Partnerships. Ceres is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC ("MSSBH").��MSSBH is majority-owned indirectly by Morgan Stanley and minority-owned indirectly by Citigroup Inc. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC is doing business as Morgan Stanley Wealth Management ("Morgan Stanley Wealth Management").��This entity, where the Partnerships continue to maintain a cash account, previously acted as a non-clearing commodity broker for the Partnerships.��The clearing commodity brokers are Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("MS&Co.") and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc ("MSIP").��MS&Co. also acts as the counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts. Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG") acts as the counterparty on all trading of options on foreign currency forward contracts. MSIP serves as the commodity broker for trades on the London Metal Exchange ("LME") .��Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is a principal subsidiary of MSSBH.��MS&Co., MSIP, and MSCG are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley.The Partnership no longer offer units of limited partnership interest ("Unit(s)") for purchase or exchange.Effective the close of business on October 31, 2012, Ceres terminated the management agreement dated as of November 1, 1994, and as amended on November 30, 2000, between Ceres, John W. Henry & Company, Inc. ("JWH") and Spectrum Technical.��Consequently, JWH ceased all trading on behalf of Spectrum Technical effective October 31, 2012.Effective the close of business on October 31, 2012, Ceres terminated the management agreement dated as of November 1, 1994, among Ceres, Chesapeake Capital Corporation ("Chesapeake") and Spectrum Technical.��Consequently, Chesapeake ceased all trading on behalf of Spectrum Technical effective October 31, 2012.On October 22, 2012, Ceres, The Cambridge Strategy (Asset Management) Limited ("Cambridge") and Spectrum Currency entered into a management agreement pursuant to which, effective November 1, 2012, Cambridge serves as a trading advisor to Spectrum Currency and trades its allocated portion of Spectrum Currency's net assets through its investment in Cambridge Master Fund L.P. ("Cambridge Master Fund") pursuant to Cambridge Asian Markets Alpha Programme.Effective the close of business on October 10, 2012, Ceres terminated the management agreement dated as of January 1, 2012, between Ceres, Flintlock Capital Asset Management, LLC ("Flintlock") and Spectrum Currency.��The Partnership fully redeemed its investment in FL Master Fund L.P. ("FL Master Fund") effective October 10, 2012.Effective June 1, 2012, Chesapeake has agreed to temporarily reduce the management fee it receives from Spectrum Technical from an annual rate of 1/12 of 2% (a 2% annual rate) of adjusted net assets to 1/12 of 1% (a 1% annual rate) of adjusted net assets.Effective June 1, 2012, Aspect Capital Limited ("Aspect"), has agreed to reduce the monthly management fee for Spectrum Technical from 1/12 of 2.0% (a 2.0% annual rate) to 1/12 of 1.5% (a 1.5% annual rate) of the net assets as of the first day of each month.Effective May 22, 2012, Chesapeake, in consultation with the General Partner for Spectrum Technical has temporarily reduced the overall leverage of Spectrum Technical's assets traded pursuant to Chesapeake's Diversified 2XL Program (the "Program") from 75% of the customary leverage utilized by the Program, to 50% of the customary leverage utilized by the Program, a reduction of 33.33%.��This reduction in leverage was in response to the current market environment and the adverse performance experienced by Chesapeake over the past 12 months.As of January 2, 2012, the General Partner changed the trading strategy of Spectrum Currency to a strategy in which the trading advisors employ proprietary trading models and methodologies that seek to identify favorable price relationships between and among various global currency and commodity markets through the analysis of technical market information.��Spectrum Currency aims to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading directly and indirectly, in U.S. and international markets for currencies, agricultural and energy products and precious and base metals.��Spectrum Currency may employ futures, options on futures, and forward contracts in those markets.Effective January 1, 2012, the management fee payable by Spectrum Technical to Winton Capital Management Limited ("Winton") was reduced from a monthly management fee rate equal to 1/6 of 1% (a 2% annual rate) per month of net assets allocated to Winton on the first day of each month to a monthly management fee rate equal to 1/12 of 1.5% (a 1.5% annual rate) per month of net assets allocated to Winton on the first day of each month.Effective January 1, 2012, the General Partner added Flintlock and Krom River Investment Management (Cayman) Limited (together with its affiliate, Krom River Trading AG) ("Krom") as trading advisors to manage the assets of Spectrum Currency through its investments in FL Master Fund and KR Master Fund L.P. ("KR Master Fund"), respectively.Effective December 31, 2011, the General Partner removed the following trading advisors from the Spectrum Currency: JWH and Sunrise Capital Partners, LLC ("Sunrise").��Consequently, both JWH and Sunrise ceased all futures interest trading on behalf of Spectrum Currency as of that date.Effective December 1, 2011, the General Partner added Aventis Asset Management LLC ("Aventis") and PGR Capital LLP ("PGR") as trading advisors to manage the assets of Spectrum Strategic through its investment in MB Master Fund L.P.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  As of June 30, 2016, 100% of assets was allocated to the Currency market.  Liquidity: The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures, forward and options trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in futures, forwards and options, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in futures, forwards and options may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  As of June 30, 2016, approximately 100% of the Partnership's total investment exposure through its investments in the Master Fund is forward contracts which are off-exchange traded.  Capital Resources: The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only asset is its investment in the Master Fund. The Master Fund's only assets are its equity in its trading accounts, consisting of cash, cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills, if applicable. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures, forwards and options in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Results of Operations:  General: Cambridge employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the global currency markets. The process combines three types of trading strategies: a systematic technical strategy, a systematic fundamental strategy and a Market Information Strategy. These trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments. The Systematic Fundamental Strategy is used in the Asian currency section of the Cambridge portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect "market" views on the relative attractiveness of Asian currencies versus the US dollar. Assets are allocated to the Systematic Fundamental Strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global currency markets (in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and when volatility is low the allocation is increased). The Market Information Strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows. Cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns with risk controlled at the portfolio, strategy and individual trade levels.  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisor's trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades indirectly are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from Cambridge Master Fund" on open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from Cambridge Master Fund", when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, brokerage fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  Table of Contents  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $(336,967) and expenses totaling $161,060, resulting in net loss of $498,027 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $10.35 at March 31, 2016 to $9.95 at June 30, 2016.  During the second quarter, the Partnership posted a loss in net asset value due to positions within the currency sector. The most significant losses were experienced during May from long positions in the New Zealand dollar and Thai baht versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the U.S. dollar rallied amid increased speculation of a June interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Additional losses during May were incurred from positions in the Philippine peso, Indonesian rupiah, and Turkish lira. Elsewhere, losses were incurred during April from short positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the dollar slid lower on the release of weaker-than-expected economic figures in the U.S. The yen was boosted further against the U.S. dollar after Bank of Japan officials decided against additional monetary easing. A portion of the Partnership's losses for the quarter was offset by gains from positions in the Australian dollar, Chinese renminbi, and Hungarian forint.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $503,840 and expenses totaling $424,838 resulting in a net income of $79,002 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $9.92 at December 31, 2015 to $9.95 at June 30, 2016.  During the first six months of the year, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value due to trading within the currency sector. The most significant gains were experienced throughout the first quarter from long positions in the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar as the real advanced amid speculation that a corruption scandal will lead to the downfall of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's government. Additional gains were experienced from positions in the Philippine peso and Russian ruble. Elsewhere, gains were experienced during February from long positions in the Polish zloty versus the U.S. dollar as the zloty advanced after dovish comments from other central banks in Central Europe made Polish assets look relatively more attractive. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the first six months of the year was offset by losses from positions in the Japanese yen, Korean won, and New Zealand dollar.  For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $234,982 and expenses totaling $183,672, resulting in net income of $51,310 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $8.87 at March 31, 2015 to $8.90 at June 30, 2015.  During the second quarter, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value due to trading within the currency sector. The most significant gains were experienced in April from long positions in the Singapore dollar as the value of Singapore's dollar strengthened after the Monetary Authority of Singapore refrained from easing monetary policy again following its surprise move in January. Elsewhere, gains were experienced from long positions in the Korean won versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar weakened after disappointing U.S. output data reinforced expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may take a dovish stance on the timing of an interest rate hike. Additional gains were recorded in the New Zealand dollar, Chilean peso, Russian ruble, Hungarian forint, and Malaysian ringgit. A portion of these gains was offset by losses incurred from positions in the euro and Indian rupee.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $1,120,212 and expenses totaling $465,258, resulting in net income of $654,954 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $8.49 at December 31, 2014 to $8.90 at June 30, 2015.  During the first six months of the year, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value due to trading within the currency sector. The most significant gains were experienced in January from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the euro touched an 11-year low after European Central Bank ("ECB") President Mario Draghi unveiled a program of sovereign-debt purchases to supplement existing easing measures. Additional gains were recorded during March from short euro positions and long Russian ruble positions versus the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere, gains were experienced during March from long positions in the Chinese renminbi as China started March on a positive note with a large upside surprise to export data while imports dropped off sharply. Additional gains were recorded from positions in the New Zealand dollar, Singapore dollar, Chilean peso, and Korean won. A portion of these gains was offset by losses incurred from positions in the Brazilian real, Taiwan dollar, and Philippine peso.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  As of December 31, 2015, the percentage of assets allocated to each market sector was approximately as follows: Currency 100%.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as clearing commodity broker in separate futures, forwards and options trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in futures, forwards and options, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in futures, forwards and options may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits". Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures, forwards and options in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forwards and options markets.  Cambridge trades in its Asian Markets Alpha Programme and its Emerging Markets Alpha Programme on behalf of the Partnership. Cambridge's Asian Markets Alpha Programme employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the global currency markets. The process combines three types of trading strategies; a Systematic Technical Strategy, a Systematic Fundamental Strategy and a Market Information Strategy. These trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments. The Systematic Fundamental Strategy is used in the Asian currency section of Cambridge's portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect "market" views on the relative attractiveness of Asian currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Assets are allocated to the Systematic Fundamental Strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global currency markets (in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and, when volatility is low, the allocation is increased). The Market Information Strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows.  Cambridge's Emerging Markets Alpha Programme aims to profit from short and medium term moves in the developing markets' currency pairs. To achieve this, the strategy employs a largely systematic approach, designed to perform across diverse market environments. The process combines three decision making tools: a Systematic Technical Strategy, a Systematic Fundamental Strategy and a Market Information Strategy.  During periods of higher volatility, the Systematic Technical Strategy uses a series of proprietary trading algorithms operating over multiple timeframes. The algorithms combine trend continuation and trend reversal signals. During periods of lower volatility, the Systematic Fundamental Strategy reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect "market" views on the relative attractiveness of currencies versus the U.S. dollar thereby realizing the inherent benefits of the carry trade. The Market Information Strategy leverages the experience and global network of Cambridge's portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows.  Cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns (with risk controlled at the portfolio, strategy and individual trade levels). While a daily value-at-risk ("VaR") limit is enforced at both the aggregate portfolio and sub-strategy level, a further layer of risk mitigation is incorporated within each strategy. For the Systematic Technical and Market Information Strategies "left side" tail risk is monitored using a proprietary methodology grounded in Extreme Value Theory. Within the Systematic Fundamental Strategy, the aggregate net U.S. dollar exposure is maintained at zero.  Krom River traded its Krom Commodity Program on behalf of the Partnership prior to its termination effective December 31, 2014. The Krom Commodity Program traded in around 20 different markets including base metals, precious metals, energy, agricultural and softs. The trade types included long volatility, directional and relative value. The trading instruments were exchange-listed futures and options, which were traded on both fundamental and technical basis. The Krom Commodity Program did not trade over-the-counter instruments or take physical deliveries.  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor for the periods ended December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively, and the change during the applicable period.   Allocations as of Allocations as of Allocations as of Allocations as of Change December 31, September 30, December 31, September 30, during the Trading Avisor 2015 (%) 2015 (%) 2015 ($) 2015 ($) period (%) Cambrige 100.00 % 100.00 % 13,267,660 14,096,398 (5.88 ) %  Table of Contents  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts" and "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from KR Master Fund and Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from Cambridge Master Fund", for open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" and "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from KR Master Fund and Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from Cambridge Master Fund", respectively, when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's total trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, General Partner fees, ongoing placement agent fees, incentive fees and brokerage fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  Ceres believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $3,226,634 and expenses totaling $1,084,417, resulting in net income of $2,142,217 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $8.49 at December 31, 2014 to $9.92 at December 31, 2015. Total redemptions for the year were $2,643,888 and the Partnership's ending capital was $13,267,660 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $501,671 from ending capital at December 31, 2014 of $13,769,331.  During the year, the Partnership posted a gain in Net Asset Value due to trading within the currency sector. The most significant gains were experienced in July and August from short positions in various currencies, particularly the Korean won, Taiwan dollar, and Thai baht against the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar advanced amid signals from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that the central bank may raise interest rates later in 2015 on the back of an improving U.S. economy. Further pressure was put on these currencies as concerns regarding economic growth in China began to rise in late July. Additional gains were experienced during August from short positions in the Chinese renminbi versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the renminbi declined as a result of a surprise policy change by the People's Bank of China to devalue the currency amid weakening exports and slowing economic growth. Further gains were experienced during January from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the euro touched an 11-year low after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi unveiled a program of sovereign-debt purchases to supplement existing easing measures. Additional gains were recorded during March from short euro positions and long Russian ruble positions versus the U.S. dollar and during April from long positions in the Singapore dollar. The Partnership's trading gains during the year were partially offset by losses from positions in the Indian rupee and Malaysian ringgit during the second half of the year. Modest losses were also incurred during May and October from long positions in the Indonesian rupiah against the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar advanced as rising U.S. inflation and hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen revived expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike in the second half of 2015.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $2,936,544 and expenses totaling $1,029,019, resulting in net income of $1,907,525 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $7.39 at December 31, 2013 to $8.49 at December 31, 2014. Total redemptions for the year were $6,107,266 and the Partnership's ending capital was $13,769,331 at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $4,199,741 from ending capital at December 31, 2013 of $17,969,072.  During the year, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value per Unit as profits in the currency, agricultural, and metals sectors more than offset losses in the energy sector. The most significant gains were recorded within the currency sector in September from short positions in the euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In September, the value of the U.S. dollar advanced against a majority of its counterparts as the U.S. employment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 and the economy added more jobs than forecast, bolstering the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2015. Additional gains in this sector  Table of Contents  were recorded throughout much of the year from positions in the Indonesian rupiah, Indian rupee, Czech koruna, and Polish zloty. Within the agricultural sector, gains were recorded in March from long positions in wheat futures as prices advanced to a 10-month high on speculation that cold, dry weather was reducing yield potential in the U.S. Additional gains were recorded in January from long positions in live cattle futures as prices climbed sharply higher. Smaller gains were recorded from trading in coffee and sugar futures. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced in May from long positions in nickel and copper futures as prices advanced on speculation that demand will climb after gauges of manufacturing advanced more than estimated in China. Additional gains in metals were recorded from long positions in palladium futures during February, March, and April as prices rose amid concerns regarding supplies. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the year was offset by trading losses within the energy complex during January from short positions in natural gas futures as prices advanced following a U.S. government report that showed a record drop in U.S. inventories after cold weather boosted heating demand. Additional losses were incurred during September from long positions in gasoline futures as prices declined amid signs that supplies from Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are outstripping demand.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $983,659 and expenses totaling $1,469,990, resulting in a net loss of $486,331 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $7.57 at December 31, 2012 to $7.39 at December 31, 2013. Total redemptions for the year were $4,857,782 and the Partnership's ending capital was $17,969,072 at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $5,344,113 from ending capital at December 31, 2012, of $23,313,185.  During the year, the Partnership posted a loss in net asset value as losses from trading in energies and agriculturals offset gains from currencies and metals trading. The most significant losses were incurred in the energy sector, primarily during February and April, from long positions in crude oil and its distillate products as prices fell on reports of an increase in stockpiles and slower-than-expected U.S. economic growth. Losses in the sector were also incurred during June from short positions in crude oil as prices rose after the Syrian conflict spurred concern that the flow of supplies from the Middle East might be disrupted. Within the agricultural markets, losses were incurred primary during February and March from long positions in corn futures as prices declined as winter snowstorms in the Great Plains eased concern that drought would hurt crops in the U.S. Additional losses in the agricultural sector resulted from long positions in soybean futures in March as prices fell after government reports indicated that U.S. inventories would exceed previous forecasts. The Partnership's losses during the year were offset by gains experienced within the currency sector, primarily during May, from short positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the Japanese yen weakened beyond 100 per U.S. dollar for the first time in four years as the Bank of Japan's deflation-fighting measures had the currency headed for its longest streak of monthly declines in almost two decades. Additional gains were recorded during April, November, and December from short Japanese yen positions. Further currency gains were recorded in January from long positions in the Thai baht versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the Thai currency increased on speculation that policy makers in the Asian country would tolerate currency strength to counter inflation. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced primarily during April from short positions in gold and silver futures as precious metals prices fell sharply at mid-month on fears Cyprus and other crisis-hit countries might be forced to sell their gold reserves. Additional metals gains were recorded in January from long positions in platinum futures as prices increased on supply concerns from South Africa.  For an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of 2015 trading results, refer to the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Market Risk.  The Partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. The Partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures and forward contracts, and forward contracts in global currency markets. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by the Partnership at the same time, and the Trading Advisors were unable to offset positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to 100% of their capital accounts.  Table of Contents  In addition to the Trading Advisors' internal controls, the Trading Advisors must comply with the Partnership's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The Trading Advisors and Ceres monitor the Partnership's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and Ceres can require the Trading Advisors to modify positions of the Partnership if Ceres believes they violate the Partnership's trading policies.  Credit Risk.  In addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward and options contracts, there is a credit risk to the Partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the Partnership for futures, forward and options contracts traded in the United States, and most foreign exchanges on which the Partnership trades, is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its members or one of its member's customers, which should significantly reduce this credit risk. There is no assurance that a clearinghouse, exchange or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the Partnership, and Ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the Partnership against a default by such parties. Further, the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the broker's customers. In cases where the Partnership trades off-exchange forward contracts with a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the forward contract's counterparty.  Ceres deals with these credit risks of the Partnership in several ways. First, Ceres monitors the Partnership's credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis. The commodity brokers inform the Partnership, as with all of their customers, of the Partnership's net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions, and Ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the Partnership's potential net credit exposure, exchange by exchange, by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange, if any, to the Partnership's margin liability thereon.  Second, the Partnership's trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the Partnership's trading, usually over several different products and exchanges. Historically, the Partnership's exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and, on those relatively few occasions where the Partnership's credit exposure climbs above such level, Ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis, carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate. Material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than 50% of Units then outstanding.  Third, with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which Ceres, together with MS&Co., has determined to be creditworthy. The Partnership presently deals with MS&Co., as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts options on foreign currency forward contracts.  For additional information, see Note 5, "Financial Instruments" under "Notes to Financial Statements" in the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  Inflation has not been a major factor in the Partnership's operations.  Table of Contents  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying value of the Partnership's assets and liabilities presented in the Statements of Financial Condition that qualify as financial instruments under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825, "Financial Instruments," approximates fair value due to the short term nature of such balances.  The Partnership carries, and carried, its investment in Cambridge Master Fund and KR Master Fund, respectively, at fair value based on Partnership's (1) respective net contributions to Cambridge Master Fund and KR Master Fund and (2) its respective allocated share of the undistributed profits and losses, including realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized gains or losses, of Cambridge Master Fund and KR Master Fund. The Partnership invests in, and invested in, Cambridge Master Fund and KR Master Fund, respectively, through a "master-feeder" structure. The Partnership's pro-rata share of the results of Cambridge Master Fund's/KR Master Fund's trading activities is shown in the Partnership's Statements of Income and Expenses.  There were no direct investments held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the Partnership's investment in Cambridge Master Fund, refer to the Cambridge Master Fund's Annual Report which is included in the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  Table of Contents  Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Introduction  The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures, forwards and options. The market-sensitive instruments held by the Partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and, as a result, all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets are at risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market-sensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activity of the Partnership.  The futures, forwards and options on such contracts traded by the Partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk. Market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial instruments and commodities, factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership's open positions, and consequently in its earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and cash flow. Gains and losses on open positions of exchange-traded futures, exchange-traded forward, and exchange-traded futures-styled options contracts and forward currency options contracts are settled daily through variation margin. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts are settled upon termination of the contract. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency options contracts are settled on an agreed upon settlement date.  The Partnership's total market risk may increase or decrease as it is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the diversification among the Partnership's open positions, the volatility present within the markets, and the liquidity of the markets.  The face value of the market sector instruments held by the Partnership is typically many times the applicable margin requirements. Margin requirements generally range between 2% and 15% of contract face value. Additionally, the use of leverage causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by the Partnership typically to be many times the total capitalization of the Partnership.  The Partnership's past performance is no guarantee of its future results. Any attempt to numerically quantify the Partnership's market risk is limited by the uncertainty of its speculative trading.

Morgan Stanley/Ceres Managed
Futures Funds
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC (MSSB) through Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC, which are both owned and controlled by MSSB, market and manage the sale of the Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC acting as sponsor, general partner, manager, investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and high-net-worth (HNW) investors through the MSSB Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds.
The rationale provided by Morgan Stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts, is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time. Morgan Stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “market-time” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buy-hold asset allocation strategy.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices (i.e. developed and emerging markets), interest rates (i.e. U.S. Bonds, Eurodollar Bonds, Euro-Bund), commodities (i.e. energy, agriculture and metals) and currencies (i.e. Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen). Through investments in managed futures funds, investors are allegedly able to access invests in non-traditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
At issue for investors is the performance of Morgan Stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account. In most instances, investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management. Additionally, an “incentive-based” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years. This “performance-based” fee is usually paid net of all fees. In addition to management and performance fees, a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions. The net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorly-explained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich Morgan Stanley.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds are privately-placed and are sold to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management offers various managed futures funds, including:

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P.
Polaris Futures Fund L.P.
Meritage Futures Fund L.P.
LV Futures Fund L.P.
Managed Futures Premier BHM, L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Graham L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Aventis II L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P.

Silver Law Group is currently investigating whether Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds managed by Ceres Managed Futures, LLC are in compliance with the securities industry’s rules and regulations concerning the suitability and disclosure requirements related to the risks, fees and terms associated with the management of their managed futures funds. The focus of the investigation includes whether the fees and terms were adequately disclosed to investors for potential FINRA sales practice violations of misrepresentation or omission of material facts, and excessive markups and markdowns, and whether the recommendations made to investors resulted in unsuitable investment advice based on client investment ability to understand and assume the risks associated with managed futures funds.

Ceres Managed Futures LLC Enters into Master Services Agreement with SS&C Technologies
Aug 6 15
Ceres Managed Futures LLC, the general partner of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P., has determined to delegate certain certain administrative functions to SS&C Technologies, Inc. currently doing business as SS&CGlobeOp (SS&C GlobeOp), and has entered into a master services agreement with SS&C GlobeOp on behalf of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P. The Master Services Agreement became operative with respect to the company in July 2015. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, SS&C GlobeOp will furnish certain administrative services in connection with the operation of the company. These administrative services include the preparation of required books and records and reports to limited partners, government agencies and regulators; computation of net asset value; assistance in connection with certain limited partner communications; calculation and accrual of income, expenses, gains and losses; preparation of financial, performance and other reporting; coordination of the annual audit with the Registrant's auditor; preparation of the company's draft annual financial statements and accompanying materials; assistance with updating periodic regulatory filings; provision of tax services as agreed with the general partner; assistance in opening and operating the company's bank accounts; provision of daily profit and loss, estimated net asset value and position and reconciliation reports; and reconciliation of daily transactions, positions and cash balances to the company's brokerage and bank accounts. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, certain books and records of the company will be kept at the offices of SS&C GlobeOp, as permitted by CFTC rules. The general partner may also continue to maintain certain of these books and records at its principal office. The Master Services Agreement's initial term is through December 31, 2016. Thereafter, the Master Services Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms. After December 31, 2016, the Master Services Agreement may be terminated by any party as of any calendar quarter end upon 180 days' written notice. The general partner pays or reimburses the company, from the administrative fee it receives, the ordinary administrative expenses of the company. This includes the expenses related to the engagement of SS&C GlobeOp. Therefore, the engagement of SS&C GlobeOp will not impact the company's break-even point.
