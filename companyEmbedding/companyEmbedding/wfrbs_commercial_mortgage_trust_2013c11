Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C11 (WFRBS 2013-C11) Certificates | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C11 (WFRBS 2013-C11) 
      Certificates
    





January 14, 2016 05:25 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2013-C11 certificates due to stable performance since issuance. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the January 2016 distribution, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been paid down by 2.2% to $1.41 billion 
      from $1.44 billion at issuance. 100% of the loans reported full year 
      2014 financials and 95% of the pool report partial year 2015 financials. 
      Based on the annualized 2015 financials, the pool's overall net 
      operating income (NOI) has increased 8.2% over the reported portfolio 
      NOI at issuance.
    

      There are six loans (9.81%) on the servicer watchlist, four (1.23%) of 
      which are on the watchlist due to concerns with increasing vacancy rate 
      at the properties and the lack of information from the sponsors 
      regarding progress on leasing activity. The remaining two loans (8.58%) 
      are on the servicer list for a lack of information or response to the 
      servicer loan inquiries. None of the loans on the watchlist are 
      considered Fitch Loans of Concern. One loan (1%) is in special servicing.
    

      The specially serviced loan, Minot Hotel Portfolio, is collateralized by 
      two hotels, the Holiday Inn Riverside and Holiday Inn Express, 
      comprising of 238 rooms located in the town of Minot, ND which is 110 
      miles north of the state capital of Bismarck. At issuance, the portfolio 
      was performing well with occupancy at 67% and a debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) of 2.77 times (x). Performance decreased significantly 
      during 2015 as the market expanded with 12 new hotels opening during the 
      preceding 12 months as well as decline in demand due to dropping oil 
      prices. The sponsor commenced with a large property improvement plan and 
      a number of units were decommissioned during the renovation. Performance 
      may improve in 2016 as work is completed; however, Fitch will monitor 
      the loan as the sponsor updates the servicer on the portfolio's 
      operation during the first half of 2016. Fitch losses are based on 
      current cashflow and a stressed cap rate.
    

      The largest loan is collateralized by a 56-story, 1,302,107 square foot 
      (sf) Republic Plaza, a class A, LEED EB Gold certified urban office 
      property located in Denver, CO (11%). The property is located within the 
      central business district approximately two blocks from the city's 
      primary mass transit stations and minutes from the city's major 
      freeways. The sponsor of the property is Brookfield Properties Investor 
      Corporation, a wholly owned entity of Brookfield Office Properties, Inc. 
      The property serves as the headquarters for three major corporate 
      entities, Encana (35% of NRA, lease expiration April 2019), DCP 
      Midstream (12% of NRA, lease expiration May 2016), and Wheeler Trigg 
      O'Donnell (6% of NRA, lease expiration January 2023). The subject 
      commands some of the highest rates in the submarket and a number of 
      tenant leases are scheduled to roll during the term of the loan. During 
      the past 12 months, more than one million square feet of office space 
      has been completed in the market which has placed downward pressure on 
      rental rates. Fitch will monitor the loan as the sponsor works to renew 
      a number of tenants, including DCP Midstream, in a competitive leasing 
      environment.
    

      Fitch continues to monitor the performance of the Community Corporate 
      Center, the fifteenth largest loan in the pool (1.1%). The loan is 
      collateralized by 255,371 sf office property located in suburban 
      Columbus, OH. The subject has a diverse rent roll of 25 distinct tenants 
      with the top five comprising only 45.9% of the net rentable area (NRA). 
      However, tenant rollover at the property is concentrated over the next 
      36 months with 24.1% and 11.2% of the NRA rolling in 2016 and 2018, 
      respectively. A leasing reserve was established at issuance to mitigate 
      the risk and costs associated with renewing the existing tenants in a 
      highly competitive market environment.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$34.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$278.5 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46.8 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$417.8 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$97.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$134.7 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$1.1 billion class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$152.6 million class X-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.2 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46.7 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32.2 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25.1 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G certificate.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
