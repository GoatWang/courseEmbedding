- CONSTRUCTION INQUIRY -

CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

The RCM construction team has managed  the renovation of over 7,700 homes and $210M of construction since  2010. 
Since 2010, the RCM construction team has undertaken projects ranging from minor cosmetic rehabs to $400K and up overhauls  of million dollar homes.  Our team includes a mix of internalized labor   and third-party sub-contractors.
                       In 2013 RCM   renovated  270 homes per month with 52 full-time  employees and over 600 subcontractors working exclusively for the  company.                    
                      










 To maximize the value on every project, RCM benefits from pre-negotiated pricing on materials with nationwide suppliers, and pre-negotiated labor costs with subcontractors. Our approach includes conducting an initial estimate at the property by our field construction personnel, and then a second review by our in office analysts to determine the proper scope of work. Field personnel walk the property throughout construction to ensure an on-time, quality delivery.
The RCM construction group has created a standardized renovation package and have negotiated standardized pricing for three private equity funds. These detailed construction processes and manuals detail every finish package and provide guidelines for all construction scope decisions, further enhancing construction efficiency. 
Tiered construction scopes have been set by price points and individually modified to meet client preferences on a market-by-market basis.

- DISPOSITIONS INQUIRY -




 Enter your details below and one of our experts will respond as soon as possible






































DisPOSITIONS

RCM is currently coordinating  disposition efforts on over 300 units for private equity investors  and our own privately funded portfolio. 
RCM takes a measured approach to coordinating property dispositions. We generally evaluate three initial options to maximize value for selling any particular asset: retail sale to owner occupant, selling to an institutional investor as yield product, and selling to smaller foreign investors. We consider a range of factors, from rental value versus retail value, to occupancy status of property and property condition.                     
                    























RETAIL BUYERS 
If a property has a greater retail value than its cap rate value, we take a detailed look at the subject property and comparable sales and determine an ideal level of rehab that will allow our client to maximize net proceeds. 



























INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
RCM has bought on behalf of multiple private equity funds and competed daily against all others. We have deep, granular knowledge on the underwriting guidelines of various funds and experience in knowing which group will pay the most for a specific asset. 
Net yield, price point, vintage, quality of neighborhood, and proximity to MSA density are common factors used to select the best fund for a particular asset. 



























FOREIGN BUYERS
We have sold thousands of properties over the last five years to Australian, Chinese, European, South African, and Israeli buyers. Each market has unique investment motivations and concerns and our experience indicates which markets have the greatest appetite for specific products. 




The experience to help you gain maximum value
 Our approach combines the ability to granularly determine value on an individual asset basis, direct relationships with all major institutional buyers, and unique access and experience with foreign markets.                     
                    While real estate brokers generally take the approach of listing a home on the market and seeing what happens, we know who your buyer is generally going to be, create markets that don’t exist to the average seller, and are able to expedite the sales process and minimize costs associated with the transaction.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES

RCM understands that single family property  management is an undeveloped yet crucial service in this new long-term asset  class. With that knowledge RCM entered the property management space foreseeing the opportunity within our own larger portfolio of rental properties that were underperforming with various 3rd party providers, capitalizing the need to improve economic occupancy.
With years of deep experience in the property management industry, RCM offers an advantage over competitors through financial reporting and owner communication segments of our business to support the needs of large sophisticated investors.                      
The remainder of our property management business is built around servicing our residents. We maintain a positive and consistent relationship with our tenants, which improves our ability to collect, renew leases, and keep properties in better condition.                      
After considering several industry programs like Yardi, Propertyware, and Appfolio we realized that each software package had significant limitations in terms of meeting the needs of our clients and our own company. RCM has since established a proprietary software application that fully manages this asset class, filling in the task oriented details that all other platforms lack. Additionally a dedicated task manager monitors and tracks the details and logistical challenges of the single-family property management side of our business through our proprietary software.

RCM has acquired over 6,000 homes  since founded in 2010.

Residental Capital Management has self funded over 1200 single family properties.  Additionally RCM has sourced an additional 4800 single family properties for private equity investors.  
Our approach includes using foreclosure auctions, bank relationships,  direct marketing, non-performing loans, MLS listings and wholesalers  to acquire product. 
We compile information, determine rents, set  value, review title, conduct walk throughs, film video, estimate renovations and bid on  over 8000 properties per month in five markets.  Our 25 property  scouts are in the marketplace, driving homes daily along with a team of 10 analysts and three managers. 
 The combination of street level  market knowledge and advanced analytics gives us our competitive advantage. 
Our knowledge  includes a database of  nearly every transaction per market, thousands of homes in our own  portfolio that are used for renovation, rent comparisons, as well as data  scrubbing of county tax records, MLS, Zillow and other websites. 
This information allows us  to accurately value thousands of properties in a condensed timeframe and derive actionable insight that we can put to work for you. 
Proprietary software stores modeled underwriting data, allows real  time adjustment of bidding and purchases during auctions, and  immediately reconciles checks and purchases. 
RCM has also worked with multiple  Private Equity firms to set yield expectations and underwrite  metrics in multiple markets.  
Applying the combination of market knowledge and  detailed understanding of private equity value realization allow us  to better structure under RCM metrics with IRR maximization in  mind.
