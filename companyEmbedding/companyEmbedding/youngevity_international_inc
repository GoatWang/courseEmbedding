The Youngevity Mission
What if you could wake up each day full of energy and vitality, with that unmistakable glow of radiant good health, abundant possibilities and ample prosperity? That’s what Youngevity is all about!
We exist to deliver exceptional nutrition and healthy lifestyle solutions for you, so you can more easily meet the often overwhelming demands of modern living.









 




Joel D. Wallach, BS, DVM, ND
Youngevity’s Founder
Lots of people dream about changing the world, but very few ever try it — let alone do it. Dr. Joel Wallach’s relentless 45-year pursuit of scientific truth, and his persistent willingness to challenge the status quo, has enriched the lives and improved the health and well-being of millions of people. 
See
 Dr. Wallach's Story










 





 
 





90 For Life™
Dr. Wallach discovered that the body requires 90 essential nutrients to fully function. With these nutrients the body can avoid, and even reverse, many of today’s pressing health concerns.
However, nutrients are only as good as your body’s ability to absorb them. Youngevity’s core “90 For Life” products, specifically designed for ideal absorption, ensure that your body has the nutrients it needs to perform at its optimum level so you feel younger, have more energy and live longer. 
Discover
 what the 90 can do for you






 




The Healthy Body Challenge
After decades of clinical experience, Dr. Wallach discovered the critical importance of proper nutrition. In today’s fast-paced, prepackaged world, complete nutrition isn’t easily obtained from what we eat. Additionally, much of today’s agricultural soils have been exhausted of nutrients, causing all of us to need to supplement our diets to enjoy full, healthy lives. 
Learn
 about the challenge









 








Life-Enhancing Products
Today, Youngevity enjoys an ever-expanding network of quality brands that now includes premium coffees, essential oils, mineral makeup, photo keepsakes, gourmet on-the-go foods and food storage, and many others.

"Youngevity's high quality health and wellness products are in sync with what I believe to be the foundation of a long and healthy life."

Changing the World
Dr. Wallach joined forces with his son, Steve, and his daughter-in-law, Michelle, to create Youngevity. They’ve meticulously assembled a world-class executive team with Scientific and Athletic Advisory Boards comprised of some of the most respected names in the fields of medicine, nutrition and network marketing. These amazing leaders provide cutting-edge research, unparalleled leadership and matchless motivation.

Are you next?
“To save America, we need to build an Army…and we’ll pay you a ridiculous amount of money to help!” -Dr. Wallach
Dr. Wallach knew that to positively impact the health of the world he needed to start an unstoppable movement.
Already familiar with the power of relationship marketing and direct sales, Dr. Wallach decided that Youngevity would invite in a premiere network-marketing company to complete the picture. This powerful combination proves that our success is attainable as we help other people attain purposeful lives.

Code of Ethics

 Code of Ethics
Within Youngevity International, Inc., (OTC STOCK SYMBOL:YGYI), honesty, trust, and respect provide the foundation of our business dealings and is paramount to our strong standing in the marketplace. As employees, we are each responsible to act honestly and candidly in all decisions to insure strong relationships are built with all customers, both external and internal.  Our Code of Ethics is provided as a framework for the principles by which each of us should conduct our daily activities and interactions with each other, and those others with whom we do business.  The Code of Ethics in brief asks each employee to:

Respect individual rights and the property of others
Consistently produce and retain accurate records
Report any unethical behavior and avoid conflicts of interest
Comply with all laws, rules, and regulatory requirements
Use best efforts in the protection, and management of YGYI's assets and resources
Maintain the confidentiality of YGYI information


Respectfully Foster a Safe Work Environment
YGYI is committed to providing a safe, healthy, fun environment for employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders. We have strict policies in place to protect against harassment, discrimination and unsafe behavior, however, it is up to each of us, as individuals, to see these policies are followed and properly policed.  Through strong and sincere respect for each other, and that of the entire YGYI team, is the only we can create and maintain a safe, vibrant and prosperous work environment.
Accurate Reporting and Record Keeping
Each one of us is responsible for monitoring and/or creating accurate reporting of YGYI's business and operations. We must all cooperate daily to make sure that correct records are maintained, that financial disclosures comply with the regulations, laws and rules that apply to us, and that any official proceedings are not impeded. Any questions about how to retain or when to destroy records should be directed at Accounting, Human Resources, or our corporate legal counsel. Please report any concerns about record keeping or any other unethical behavior to your supervisor, your Human Resources representative, an independent Board Member, or to our 24-hour Unethical Behavior Hot Line.
Legal Compliance
All YGYI employees must be aware of the laws and regulations that govern our business, particularly laws and regulations related to our specific jobs. It is up to each of us to adhere to these laws as well as to prevent, detect, and report instances of illegal behavior that do not support the interests and well-being of the company.
Beyond compliance with the law, YGYI employees should act in good faith during interactions with local, state, and federal organizations. All communication with government officials and all lobbying activities must be direct, honest, and in accordance with the rights and responsibilities relevant to our company and operations. Finally, YGYI operates in the global marketplace with diverse customs; we must each be aware of the relevant laws of the countries with which YGYI trades and otherwise conducts business.
Conflicts of Interest
A "conflict of interest" occurs whenever private or personal interests interfere with performance of duties or the best interests of the company as a whole. We should avoid conflicts of personal interests with YGYI interests and even situations that may appear to constitute a conflict of interest. Each of us is obligated to avoid situations or business relationships that might impair loyalty to YGYI or affect personal judgment regarding what is in the company's best interests.  Only the Board of Directors can provide authorization to employees of situations where perceived conflict of interest may be applicable.  If you have questions about what constitutes a conflict of interest or if you become aware of an actual conflict of interest, please contact a supervisor, the Human Resources Department, or the company's outside legal counsel
Corporate Assets and Resources
Each employee is responsible for the good management, safe keeping, and efficient use of YGYI's assets and resources, which include intellectual and physical property, staff, inventory, consumables, and capital assets.   It is everyone's responsibility of seeing that YGYI funds are spent in a fiscally responsible manner and that our resources are used only for YGYI business purposes. Employees should be aware that YGYI maintains the right to access, review, and monitor any information transmitted, received or stored using our electronic equipment, with or without an employee's or third party's knowledge, consent or approval (Please refer to The Employee Manual for more information).  Please use discretion, moderation, and good judgment when gift-giving and entertainment are options.  No one should take personal advantage of opportunities or potential opportunities that properly belong to YGYI, or are discovered in the course of employment or directorship, without first obtaining consent from a direct supervisor, Human Resources or in the case of executive officers and directors, the Board.  If you suspect or know of a misuse of YGYI company assets, resources, or opportunities, please report it immediately to Corporate General Counsel, the 24-hour Unethical Behavior Hot Line.
Public Relations
From time to time Newspapers, magazines, radio or television request information about YGYI. Being a public company it is important to speak to the media with a consistent message about our business and to factually represent YGYI's mission and business platform and history in a consistent manner.
To help ensure this consistency we've come up with a few ground rules:

The Chief Financial Officer or the Manager of Investor Relations will handle all inquiries about earnings releases, finances, or material contract disclosures. Any related questions on these topics should be promptly referred to the Investor Relations Department.
The CEO, the VP of Marketing, or the CFO must approve any press releases, statements to the press or interviews with the media in advance.
Employees, if contacted by the by the media, will refer the media, without comment, to the CEO, the VP of Marketing, or the CFO.  Only they will determine what information can be made available to the public.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 59.8% in the current quarter compared to 61.5% in the same period last year.Operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016, increased approximately 11.1% to $23.9 million as compared to $21.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The main contributor to the increase was derived from a significant increase in sales and marketing expense which increased 65.6% to $2.6 million in the current quarter from $1.6 million in the same period last year. This was primarily due to the Company's annual convention held in the first quarter in 2015 as compared to the current year convention held in the second quarter of the current year.For the second quarter of 2016, the general and administrative expense increased 6.7% to $4.5 million from $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and consulting fees.For the three months ended June 30, 2016 total other expense decreased to $1.6 million as compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the change in fair value of the warrant derivative liability from $2.2 million in 2015 to $484,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016.For the second quarter of 2016, the Company reported a net loss of $109,000 as compared to a net loss of $408,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as adjusted to remove the effect of stock based compensation expense and change in fair value of warrants, or "Adjusted EBITDA," was $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $3.3 million in the same period for the prior year.Fiscal 2016 First Six Months Results: For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our revenue increased 6.8% to $80.7 million as compared to $75.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we derived approximately 89% of our revenue from our direct selling segment and approximately 11% of our revenue from our commercial coffee segment. The increase in direct selling revenue is attributed primarily to the increase in our product offerings, the increase in the number of distributors selling our product and the increase in the number of customers consuming our products as well as $3.7 million derived from new acquisitions.Read MoreFor the first six months of fiscal 2016, gross profit increased approximately 10.7% to $48.8 million as compared to $44.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.For the first six months of fiscal 2016, total operating expenses increased approximately 11.3% to $46.1 million as compared to $41.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.Total other expense decreased to $2,027,000 for the first six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $4,480,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant derivative from an expense of $2,301,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to a gain of $166,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2016.For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company reported net income of $42,000 as compared to a net loss of $777,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The net increase of $819,000 was primarily attributable to the change in fair value of warrant derivative discussed above, offset by an income tax benefit of $1,040,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $618,000 for the same period in the current year.EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as adjusted to remove the effect of stock based compensation expense and the change in the fair value of the warrant derivative or "Adjusted EBITDA," was $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $4.5 million in the same period for the prior year.Conference Call Information Management will host a conference call today at 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time (1:15 PM Pacific Daylight Time), to discuss the Company's financial results, for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team.Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking net income, and adding back the expenses related to interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation expense and change in the fair value of the warrant derivative, as each of those elements are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position, as Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP. A reconciliation is provided at the end of this press release.About Youngevity International Youngevity International, Inc.
