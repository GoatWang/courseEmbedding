            We LOVE this Bible story book. It is great for little bitty kiddos. The stories are just the right length - not too long, but get enough of the story in. The pictures are always interesting and the kids love to find the dove hidden in each picture.

            This bible can be used for various stages of a childs life. Great pictures and love that they included Bible passage so as child gets older will be able to look at actual verse.

            Our 3 year old grandson wanted a Bible to take to church, and this is a great size with pictures and short stories that are just right to read to him.

            Just right as a daily devotional for my 2 and 4 year olds.  We use in combination with the Thru the Bible coloring pages to allow the lessons to "stick".

            The selection of stories provides an overview of the Bible. Scripture location is given for each story. The pictures are vivid and colorful. Each story ends with a question.

            I like the questions at the end of each reading to help the preschooler focus and help the parent understand if the child is comprehending. I also like the idea that the child will be able to read at an early reading level.

About the AuthorDr. Kenneth TaylorThroughout his publishing career, Dr. Kenneth 
Taylor's dream has been for all peoples of the 
world to read and experience God's Word in their 
lives. From his earliest children's books to his 
generous support of Christian ministry, this 
vision is reflected in his work.
While beginning his publishing career as an 
editor at InterVarsity Press and then director 
of Moody Press, Dr. Taylor wrote several 
children's books in the 1950's. Born out of experience with his own ten children, Stories 
for the Children's Hour, The Bible in Pictures 
for Little Eyes, and others are now being 
enjoyed by a second generation of children. My First Bible in Pictures was included in Publishers Weekly's list of "All-Time 
Best-Selling Children's Books" in 2001.  His 
love for children (including his 28 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren) 
continues to inspire new titles.    
In fact, it was his children, in their confusion over the meaning of the King James text, who prompted his mission to make the Bible 
understandable for everyone. Dr. Taylor's Living Letters, a thought-for-thought translation of the New Testament epistles, was published by the newly formed Tyndale House Publishers in 1962. The complete Living Bible followed in 1971 and has now sold over 40 million copies in its many editions. 
In 1996 Tyndale House introduced the New Living Translation.  In keeping with Dr. Taylor's vision of Scriptures that everyone can read, the New Living Translation is a thought-for-thought translation that is exegetically 
accurate and idiomatically authoritative.  
Ninety of today's leading Bible scholars 
worked with Tyndale House to develop this 
easy-to-understand translation.
With Dr. Taylor as Chairman of the Board, 
Tyndale has become one of the top evangelical 
publishers in America and today publishes books, 
several Bible lines, periodicals, videos, and 
specialty products.  During the past forty 
years, Tyndale House has distributed over 
100 million Bibles, New Testaments, and Bible 
portions worldwide.
Dr. Taylor has used the success of The Living Bible to further his mission by distributing all its royalties to Christian ministries worldwide. He founded Living Bibles International (which merged in 1992 with the International Bible Society) for translating, publishing, and distributing modern-language versions of the Bible around the world. His life of service has been recognized with at least 30 honors and awards from different organizations, including four honorary doctorates.  In October 2000, Dr. and Mrs. (Margaret) Taylor were awarded the Distinguished Service to Family Award by Wheaton College.
A graduate of Wheaton College, with graduate 
studies at Dallas Theological Seminary and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dr. Taylor has held 15 directorships with Christian 
organizations at home and abroad. He and Mrs. Taylor live in Wheaton, Illinois.

About the AuthorDr. Kenneth TaylorThroughout his publishing career, Dr. Kenneth 
Taylor's dream has been for all peoples of the 
world to read and experience God's Word in their 
lives. From his earliest children's books to his 
generous support of Christian ministry, this 
vision is reflected in his work.
While beginning his publishing career as an 
editor at InterVarsity Press and then director 
of Moody Press, Dr. Taylor wrote several 
children's books in the 1950's. Born out of experience with his own ten children, Stories 
for the Children's Hour, The Bible in Pictures 
for Little Eyes, and others are now being 
enjoyed by a second generation of children. My First Bible in Pictures was included in Publishers Weekly's list of "All-Time 
Best-Selling Children's Books" in 2001.  His 
love for children (including his 28 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren) 
continues to inspire new titles.    
In fact, it was his children, in their confusion over the meaning of the King James text, who prompted his mission to make the Bible 
understandable for everyone. Dr. Taylor's Living Letters, a thought-for-thought translation of the New Testament epistles, was published by the newly formed Tyndale House Publishers in 1962. The complete Living Bible followed in 1971 and has now sold over 40 million copies in its many editions. 
In 1996 Tyndale House introduced the New Living Translation.  In keeping with Dr. Taylor's vision of Scriptures that everyone can read, the New Living Translation is a thought-for-thought translation that is exegetically 
accurate and idiomatically authoritative.  
Ninety of today's leading Bible scholars 
worked with Tyndale House to develop this 
easy-to-understand translation.
With Dr. Taylor as Chairman of the Board, 
Tyndale has become one of the top evangelical 
publishers in America and today publishes books, 
several Bible lines, periodicals, videos, and 
specialty products.  During the past forty 
years, Tyndale House has distributed over 
100 million Bibles, New Testaments, and Bible 
portions worldwide.
Dr. Taylor has used the success of The Living Bible to further his mission by distributing all its royalties to Christian ministries worldwide. He founded Living Bibles International (which merged in 1992 with the International Bible Society) for translating, publishing, and distributing modern-language versions of the Bible around the world. His life of service has been recognized with at least 30 honors and awards from different organizations, including four honorary doctorates.  In October 2000, Dr. and Mrs. (Margaret) Taylor were awarded the Distinguished Service to Family Award by Wheaton College.
A graduate of Wheaton College, with graduate 
studies at Dallas Theological Seminary and Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dr. Taylor has held 15 directorships with Christian 
organizations at home and abroad. He and Mrs. Taylor live in Wheaton, Illinois.
