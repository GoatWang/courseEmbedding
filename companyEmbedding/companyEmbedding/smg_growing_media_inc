This Amendment No. 7 is being filed primarily because, on November 29, 2016, SMG Growing Media, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“SMG”), fully exercised the Warrant, dated April 22, 2013 (the “Warrant”), between SMG and AeroGrow International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Issuer”), resulting in SMG’s acquisition of 21,613,342 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), of the Issuer. In addition, upon SMG’s exercise of the Warrant, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”), owned by SMG automatically converted into 2,649,007 shares of Common Stock.  SMG’s acquisition of the 24,262,349 additional shares of Common Stock increases the percentage of the total number of shares of Common Stock previously reported as being beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons (as defined below in Item 2), because, pursuant to the Warrant, the Reporting Persons had the right to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock that constitutes, on a “fully diluted basis”, 80% of the Issuer’s outstanding capital stock (when added to all other shares owned by SMG), as calculated as of the date or dates of exercise. “Fully diluted basis” assumes that all options, warrants or other convertible securities or instruments or other rights to acquire Common Stock or any other existing or future classes of capital stock of the Issuer, have been exercised or converted, as applicable, in full, regardless of whether any such options, warrants, convertible securities or instruments or other rights are then vested or exercisable or convertible, in accordance with their terms. See Item 4 below.CUSIP No. 00768M202Page 4Item 1.    Security and Issuer.This Schedule 13D relates to the Common Stock of the Issuer. The Issuer’s principal executive offices are located at 6075 Longbow Drive, Suite 200, Boulder, Colorado 80301.Item 2.    Identity and Background.This Schedule 13D is being filed by SMG and The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, an Ohio corporation (“Scotts”) (together with SMG, the “Reporting Persons”), with respect to the shares of Common Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons.The Common Stock reported in this Schedule 13D is directly owned by SMG. SMG is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Scotts. Scotts does not own directly any securities of the Issuer. However, as a result of Scotts’ direct ownership of all of SMG’s equity, Scotts may be deemed to beneficially own securities of the Issuer directly owned by SMG. Each of the Reporting Persons specifically disclaims beneficial ownership in the Common Stock reported herein except to the extent it actually exercises voting or dispositive power with respect to such Common Stock.The information required by General Instruction C to Schedule 13D with respect to the executive officers and directors of Scotts is listed on Schedule A hereto under the heading “Scotts Executive Officers and Directors” (such persons, the “Controlling Persons”).SMG and Scotts are holding companies, and they each have their principal business address located at 14111 Scottslawn Road, Marysville, Ohio 43041.None of the Reporting Persons or the Controlling Persons (together the “Scotts Persons”) have, during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. Except as disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Scotts on September 7, 2012, which information is incorporated herein by reference, none of the Scotts Persons have, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).Item 3.    Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.The aggregate amount of funds used by the Reporting Persons to fully exercise the Warrant was approximately $47,768,263.96. The source of funds was the working capital of the Reporting Persons.Item 4.    Purpose of Transaction.On November 16, 2016, representatives of the Reporting Persons (the “Scotts Representatives”) met with the board of directors (the “Board”) and several members of management of the Issuer. During this meeting, the Scotts Representatives reiterated the Reporting Persons’ intention to exercise some or all of the Warrant prior to December 31, 2016 and discussed various strategic transactions that the Reporting Persons may pursue following such exercise which, if effected, could result in, among other things, any of the matters identified in Items 4(a)-(j) of Schedule 13D. In particular, each Reporting Person may at any time and from time to time: (i) in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, acquire additional shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer, including acquisitions from affiliates of the Reporting Persons; (ii) pledge, encumber, provide a security interest with respect to, dispose of or transfer (including pursuant to the exercise of a pledge, encumbrance or other security interest and pursuant to the registration rights described in Item 6 herein) all or a portion of the securities of the Issuer, including shares of Common Stock, that the Reporting Persons now own or may hereafter acquire to any person or entity, including transfers or dispositions to affiliates of the Reporting Persons; (iii) enter into derivative and other transactions with institutional counterparties with respect to the Issuer’s securities, including shares of Common Stock; (iv) cause or seek to cause the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries to purchase or otherwise acquire all or a portion of another person’s assets or business, including acquisitions from affiliates of the Reporting Persons; (v) cause or seek to cause the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries to enter into one or more acquisitions, business combinations, mergers or agreements to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of its assets or business to any person or entity, including sales, transfers and other CUSIP No. 00768M202Page 5dispositions to affiliates of the Reporting Persons; (vi) raise capital, or restructure the Issuer’s or any of its subsidiaries’ capitalization, indebtedness or holding company arrangements; (vii) make personnel changes to the present management of the Issuer deemed necessary or desirable; (viii) change the identity of the directors or officers of the Issuer; (ix) make any other material change in the Issuer’s or any of its subsidiaries’ corporate structure, governance, or business; or (x) engage in communications with one or more stockholders, officers or directors of the Issuer and other persons regarding any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (ix) above.On November 29, 2016, SMG fully exercised the Warrant resulting in the issuance of  21,613,342 shares of Common Stock to SMG.

Aerogrow International, Inc. (OTCMKTS:AERO) recently unveiled that Scotts Miracle-Gro Co (NYSE:SMG) SMG Growing Media, Inc. had exercised all of its outstanding warrants to acquire Aerogrow International common shares, which originates from an agreement sealed in 2013.
Warrant Exercise
Upon the warrant exercise for 21.60 million common shares, AeroGrow International has generated $47.80 million. As a result, the company has a about 33.90 million beneficial shares.
As part of this, the Aerogrow International Board of Directors has declared a $41 million or $1.21 per share distribution to shareholders of record on December 30. This will be distributed on January 3.
About $6.80 million will remain with Aerogrow International for the full repayment of the loan to Scotts Miracle-Gro and for other capital purposes. Generally, the warrant exercise automatically frees the company of its existing debts and at the same time, gives it enough funding to carry out its growth prospects. Aerogrow International is hopeful about the new opportunities this will bring.
“We’ll use that capital to accelerate the development of several exciting new products, further expand existing distribution channels, open significant new markets in North America and in other international markets, and fund increased advertising media to generate product, brand and category awareness,” guaranteed Michael Wolfe, Aerogrow International CEO and President.
Aerogrow International Board of Directors Restructuring
To reflect the new position of SMG Growing Media as a leading shareholder, the Aerogrow International Board of Directors has been restructured effective November 29. The restructuring has led to the resignation of Wolfe and Michael Barish as members of the Aerogrow International Board of Directors. Meanwhile, Wayne Harding and Jack Walker has remained as independent directors. Chris Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle-Gro The Hawthorne Gardening Co. General Manager, has replaced Walker as the Aerogrow International Chairman.
Moreover, Albert Messina, The Hawthorne Gardening Finance and Strategy Lead, and Peter Supron, Scotts Miracle-Gro Chief Operating Officer (COO), have been appointed as new members of the Aerogrow International Board of Directors.
On Friday, Aerogrow International has declined 6.93%, closing at $3.49; and Scotts Miracle-Gro has gained 4.33%, closing at $96.86.

	"Acquiring Fafard will allow us to further strengthen our North America competitiveness," said Jim Hagedorn, chairman and chief executive officer of ScottsMiracle-Gro.

	"The Fafard family is pleased with today's announcement and believes this transaction provides the best opportunity to drive long-term growth," said Fafard president Martin Fafard. "Both our companies have the same relentless commitment to providing the best service to our customers. This deal will allow Fafard to further develop its leadership across distribution channels, as well as leverage Scotts' world-class supply chain, research and development and marketing capabilities."

	ScottsMiracle-Gro expects the Fafard business to add annual sales of approximately $40 million and for the transaction to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2015.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

	Statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, which address activities, events and developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information regarding the future economic performance and financial condition of the Company, the plans and objectives of the Company's management, and the Company's assumptions regarding such performance and plans are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified as statements that include phrases such as "guidance," "outlook," "projected," "believe," "target," "predict," "estimate," "forecast," "strategy," "may," "goal," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "should" or other similar words or phrases. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information in this release due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:


		Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase the Company's costs of doing business or limit the Company's ability to market all of its products;

		Increases in the prices of raw materials and fuel costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations;

		The highly competitive nature of the Company's markets could adversely affect its ability to maintain or grow revenues;

		Because of the concentration of the Company's sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or significant reduction in orders from, its top customers could adversely affect the Company's financial results;

		Adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results;

		The Company's international operations make the Company susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to other costs and risks associated with international regulation;

		The Company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to the Company's business;

		If Monsanto Company were to terminate the Marketing Agreement for consumer Roundup products, the Company would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption;

		Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owns approximately 27% of the Company's common shares and can significantly influence decisions that require the approval of shareholders;

		The Company may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, investments, dividends, share repurchases and/or other corporate transactions that it believes will maximize equity returns of its shareholders but may involve risks, such as risks of integration of acquired businesses, the possibility that anticipated synergies from strategic acquisitions may not materialize, and the risk that sales of acquired products may not meet expectations. 


	Additional detailed information concerning a number of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information contained in this release is readily available in the Company's publicly filed quarterly, annual and other reports. The Company disclaims any obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revision to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this release, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments.
