The 30-Minute Interview 
By

Mr. Lorber, 65, is the chairman of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, as well as the president and chief of both the Vector Group and its real estate investment subsidiary New Valley Realty, which is a majority owner of Douglas Elliman. He is also the executive chairman of the fast-food chain Nathan’s Famous. Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINOQ. You wear many hats. How do you balance all your responsibilities and interests?A. In most of these companies I have very good operating people. I’m there to help and try to make them be better at what they do.Q. Would you say you focus more on real estate and Douglas Elliman these days? A. I think so.We have over 4,000 brokers now, and 4,300 with Florida. And we just opened California a few weeks ago. We signed up a new project with one of the largest Chinese development companies, called Greenland USA. They’re developing in downtown Los Angeles; it’s going to be about 1,200 to 1,300 condos and a hotel. So we’re very excited about that.

Q. What is your main role at Elliman, and how does it differ from that of Dottie Herman, the chief executive? Continue reading the main story

A. Dottie handles day-to-day operations. She has a much tougher job than I do. She works on all the problems. Dottie’s a real people person.I try to work on all the good things that I enjoy doing. I like new development, getting involved in new projects, recruiting brokers, trying to help our brokers make money. I know a lot of developers. This morning I was out on a new project that we’re going to be doing for a developer.Q. Which one?A. I don’t think he wants to talk about it yet.It’s residential. In Manhattan. Not far from Madison Square Park. It’ll be a hotel and a condo tower. There will probably be about 40 or so units and a nice-size hotel. That’s sort of a trend today, because hotels are so expensive to build, you have to combine them to lower the cost of your hotel by selling condominiums at a profit. We’re doing two of those in Miami.Q. What’s your outlook for New York real estate this year?A. I’m very bullish. I think the city is still going to move forward. We have three to five good years coming up.Q. And of New York real estate with Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ran under a campaign for more middle-income housing?

A. What we learned is that what a politician says while he’s campaigning turns out to be somewhat different than what happens afterward.Look, I think there’ll be more affordable housing. But on the other hand, if the land costs and everything are so expensive, and you can’t find anyone to build it — developers are in it to make some money — it’s not going to happen. So you have to be realistic. I think that the push that de Blasio was speaking about regarding housing was rental housing, making it more affordable on the rental side and not so much on the purchase side.

The city is expensive to live in — it’s not easy to buy an apartment in the city.Q. How many homes do you own?

A. You want me to count? I have the city; I have Southampton; I have North Salem in Westchester; I have Fisher Island in Florida; I have one where I go bird hunting and quail hunting in Florida; and on Nantucket Island. I like collecting real estate.Q. Will you buy in the Albany, the luxury condominium development planned in the Bahamas, in which the Vector Group is a partner with the Tavistock Group?A. I’m going to buy an apartment there, probably about 3,500 feet — it’s a big three-bedroom.Q. New Valley Realty has partnerships in other developments.A. About seven or eight: 10 Madison Square; 11 East 68th Street; retail at 701 Seventh Avenue; two small investments with Steve Witkoff and Ian Schrager downtown, one is going to be condos, the other is hotel and condos; I have one in Queens in a rental building with the Property Management Group; 11 Beach Street downtown with HFZ Capital.Q. What is the status of the Albany project?A. The whole thing is now about 35 units. I think construction will start in the fall. We’re not selling in New York yet because we’re not approved by the attorney general yet. I see it as a getaway for New Yorkers and Floridians.We want to be where the same clients are, the same people are. And if you look at where we are at Douglas Elliman — New York City, Long Island, the Hamptons, Westchester, South Florida and Los Angeles — pretty much it’s the same group.Q. Will Elliman be adding any more offices?A. I think the only other market left most likely is Fairfield County: Greenwich, Westport. We have a Westchester presence with a couple of brokers who are licensed to go into Connecticut, but we will end up having an office in the not-too-distant future in Greenwich. I would hope we would get it open this year.Q. So I know you’re a fan of Nathan’s Famous, but do you like its hot dogs?A. I like to say I’m the official taste tester. I love it. I’m pretty much standard, you know, mustard and sauerkraut. Not even ketchup. But I will admit that I find the hot-dog-eating contests hard to watch.

Douglas Elliman Chairman Howard M. Lorber on the Key to His Success
 By Jeffrey Slonim |  October 17, 2016 |
Home & Real Estate

































  Share 

 Business guru and Douglas Elliman chairman Howard M. Lorber gives insight into the changing Hamptons real estate market.

A Dutch Gambrelstyle home in Bridgehampton’s new Barn & Vine development.
The “Most Interesting Man in the World” has nothing over Howard M. Lorber, the president and CEO of the publicly traded holding company Vector Group Ltd., which owns Douglas Elliman. Over his storied career, he restructured Western Union (now New Valley Corporation), taking the stock from $1 to $205 in less than two years, and helped elevate Douglas Elliman from $6 billion in sales in 2003 to $22 billion last year. On weekends, you’ll find Lorber walking his Lab, Chance, or captaining a dinghy in from his 112-foot Sunseeker yacht, Useless, to Sunset Beach.
Secret to success: “I’m known for being a straight talker,” he says. “I’m not going to tell someone what they want to hear; I’m going to tell them what I really think. It doesn’t mean I’m always right, but I’m giving them my best opinion.”
Key Hamptons project: “We’re working on a project in Bridgehampton now, Barn & Vine. The first phase just sold out; they’re going into the second phase. They built some not so contemporary houses and then they built some barn-like houses. It’s right near Wölffer Estate Vineyard, and they’ve sold very well, with sweeping views, open fields in one direction and woods in the other. That’s been a very successful project both for us and the developer. It’s a great product at reasonable prices for the Hamptons.”
Market shift: “If you had asked me 10 years ago, I would have said don’t build a modern spec house, because that eliminates 85 percent of the market,” Lorber says. “Today, it’s the opposite. On the ocean in the Hamptons, pretty much every new house is modern.”
Giving back: “I’m the chair of the Southampton Hospital Foundation. I support the Animal Rescue Fund and the Evelyn Alexander Wildlife Rescue Center. Douglas Elliman supports the Parrish Art Museum and sponsors the Hampton Classic.”
State of the market: “The market has slowed down for overpriced condominiums and houses, but if you price it right, it sells.”

Vector Group Ltd. – Welcome


 























 Welcome
Dear Investors, Customers, Employees and Friends:
Welcome to the Vector Group Ltd. website. Through our subsidiaries, Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc., we manufacture and market high quality cigarette products to adult smokers in the United States. Vector Group also owns New Valley LLC.
Vector Group’s tobacco subsidiaries have a proud history of charting an independent course in the tobacco industry, dating from Liggett’s founding in 1873. In 1996, Liggett became the first tobacco company to settle certain smoking-related litigation. A year later, we led Liggett into its landmark announcement that smoking is addictive and causes cancer and other health ailments. To this day, Liggett – the fourth largest cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. – remains the only major tobacco company to carry “Smoking Is Addictive” warning labels on its cigarette packs and to list ingredients on its cartons. Liggett has a strong collection of discount cigarette brands, which includes Eve, Grand Prix, Pyramid, Liggett Select and Eagle 20’s.

Finally I ended up using google to do my own research and found the company phone numbers to the individual health insurances offered on the market place. I called them all but the only one who seemed interested in helping me was this man named Keith from Molina healthcare.  Keith sent my info to some brokers in the area that were supposed to get back to me and never did.  I called keith back a few weeks later to let him know and he was so devastated he said he would make it his first priority to find me a broker who would take the matter seriously.  The next day he referred two different brokers.  I called the first one and got an agent named Danny Delgado.  I could tell from the first 4 sentences that he was the first agent Ive talked to that is fully knowledgeable on all this new healthcare marketplace stuff.  He explained in laymens terms all the different health care options and how each differentiated from the others.  I honestly feel 100 percent more educated on the subject myself after speaking with him.  He helped me choose the most appropriate plan for me and was not focused on trying to get me to spend as much as possible in fact he found me the cheapest plan ive seen so far.  I usually dont go out of my way to write long reviews unless im really disappointed in  something I will give credit where it is due and but Keith (of Molina Healthcare) and Danny (of Super Insurance) need to be recognized for being 2 of the few that take their job seriously now adays. I applaud you both.  Maria Elena Cisneros - State Farm Insurance Agentjploving ratedThis State Farm office is the ...This State Farm office is the Insurance office where I've had my best experience.

Barbara took good care of me during my last interaction in my search of a more affordable car insurance. She worked deligently and very  professional,  and kept constant communication until we arrived to a final decision. I will recommend them for your insurance needs. Thanks Fundora, Theresa and Barbara!Peoples Insurance Claims CenterTony D. ratedI filed a claim directly with the insurance company and was underpaid. A friend recommended I call a public adjuster to ask for advice and so she gave me PICC's number. They re-opened my claim and the insurance company ended up paying double the amount I originally received. I was able to complete the repairs in my kitchen and couldn't believe I almost didn't do anything about the little amount I had received. Pardo Public Adjusters   ( LLamen A Pardo )Victor G. ratedMy air conditioner started leaking and lifted my wood floors.  I called my insurance company and they sent me a check for $5000.  The materials alone were over $10000 not including labor.  I heard Pardo's commercial and decided to give them a chance.  At the end Pardo got my over $40,000 and it went very smooth.  Great company!!!  I recommend using them with anything to do with your home.Dollar Insurance Agencyjvs337 ratedI am grateful for this business. They treat you like family and will always give you the best insurance for your needs.

I recommend Dollar Insurance to everyone because it is truly a one of a kind insurance agency and they always are looking out for you.Peoples Insurance Claims Centerkayapril20 ratedGreat Public AdjustersDuring some severe rain the roof in my living room began to leak. Of course,  I thought it was the end of the world; not to mention the thought of dealing with the insurance company. Mary from PICC had someone out the very same day. Now, all the repairs are not complete and I couldn't be happier with PICC's service. I will recommend PICC to all my friends and family! Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
