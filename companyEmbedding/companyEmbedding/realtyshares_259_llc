RealtySharesSign Up for RealtySharesBack to PlatformsSimilar Real Estate Crowdfunding PlatformsRealCrowdRealtyMogulAcquireRealtyShares ReviewAverage Rating:  2 reviewsSummaryRealtyShares has some strong points including adequate capital, support from savvy backers, a user-friendly website and some good press. Investors also like its low minimums ($1,000 for your first deal, generally $5,000 thereafter) and hold periods as short as six months. It is also trying some innovative things such as accepting Bitcoin and providing market-specific products aimed at its core investor base among IT professionals in five cities.
But the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips, a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators. The site does have some funds and multi-family/commercial projects, but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the RE crowdfunding universe.
Investors who like the deals it offers will find RealtyShares a likeable and easy to navigate platform. But it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved.
BACKGROUND
Founded in Q2 2013 by CEO Nav Athwal, RealtyShares has received $11.9 million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including $10 million in a Series A funding in April 2015. Its backers include well known venture capitalists Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and 500 Startups.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who sits on the board of hot automated investing service Betterment, is on the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares has been compared to a Lending Club for real estate, offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects. It funds about 10 to 20 projects a month.
The inspiration for Athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development. Those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on RealtyShares. After the financial crisis of 2007, traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access.

PROS

Low minimum of $1,000 for first investment (otherwise usually $5,000), focus on deals with short lifecycles



CONS

Deal quality is not high, weighted to single family home flip market, only for accredited investors, high fees



BOTTOM LINE
RealtyShares is a smaller player in the real-estate crowdfunding arena. It has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments. But its deal flow includes many single family home flips, which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms. Its fees are considered higher than average too.
PHILOSOPHY
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal says that RealtyShares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served, especially small real estate developers and house flippers. The process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the 2007 economic crisis. They often will not lend to individuals without W2 income.
Crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns. In one case covered by CNBC, Chicago house flipper Ben Walhood said he can get full funding from RealtyShares in as little as an hour. Investors in his deals would earn around 11% vs loans around 4% if backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in traditional financing.
RealtyShares is “able to provide quicker, more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards. Banks just aren’t meeting that need,” Athwal said.
TYPICAL PROJECTS AND GEOGRAPHY
At the time of our test, there were five live deals on the site including a fund, two single family flips and two apartment buildings. Three were in California and the others in New York and Florida. RealtyShares has done transactions in 18 states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from Florida, California, Illinois and Texas.
The deals we saw ranged in size from $160,000 to $1.6 million for the RealtyShares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions. Minimum investment ranged from $2,000 to $25,000 and hold terms from eight months to five years.
RealtyShares says it welcomes cash-flowing/value add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes; equity investment in fix and flips in high demand/low supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.
TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
RealtyShares is only open to accredited investors, meaning those with net worth of $1 million or income of $200,000 a year. The platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the $2 million to $30 million range and all types of cash-flowing residential and commercial projects.
RealtyShares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years.
Many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model. RealtyShares said in 2014 that 10 to 15% of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate.
INTEREST IN INNOVATION
Athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities. Unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms, the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities. It is creating market-specific products to enable developers in Seattle, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Chicago to raise funding from local investors.
RealtyShares’ interest in innovation led it in 2014 to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The platform says this is a more cost-effective and streamlined way for investors to send money, especially if they are abroad, because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers.
WEBSITE POPULARITY
As of June 2015, RealtyShares has an estimated 90,000 monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about 4 minute on the site with 4.04 page views.  About 92% of the traffic is from the United States. As of mid-May 2015, RealtyShares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the United States.
LEADERSHIP TEAM
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer. He worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing California and national developers and REITs in the San Francisco Bay area. He doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid.
The management team is rounded out by eight specialists with hands-on experience in operations, transactions, engineering and other disciplines. Again, they have strong resumes but not high name recognition. RealtyShares’ leadership earned a B grade in one review.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
RealtyShares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as 500 Startups, so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform. But it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites, and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin.
Blogger Mark Robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on RealtyShares. While he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays, he said they have met or beat expectations.
SUMMARY
RealtyShares looks like a solid platform with long-term potential. While its low minimum investments are attractive, it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees. It is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals, especially fix and flip single family home projects. It’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or second-position loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of 8-12% annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period and/or a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property.
HOW DOES REALTYSHARES SCREEN INVESTMENTS?
RealtyShares reviews the sponsors first, looking for companies with experience. It says it runs background and credit checks. Then it reviews proposed transactions including financials, geography, property type and quality, and investment structure.
“While each investment includes risk and RealtyShares cannot guarantee results, our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform,” it says. “Once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform, investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity, and if so, how much.”
So, like other crowdfunded real estate sites, it’s up to you to do your due diligence.
UNDERWRITING/DEAL FLOW
CEO Athwal said that as of spring 2015 RealtyShares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about 1 in 10 properties that are offered to it.  “I think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property,” he said.
However, the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips. These are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators, and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lower-quality deals than bigger budget projects.
FEES
RealtyShares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications. But the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement. The ones we viewed were 40-plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher.
As best we could tell, the ongoing fees to RealtyShares as manager of the transaction LLC amounted to 1% a year. RealtyShares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals.
This article says RealtyShares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of 2 percent to 3 percent. It also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment (including providing investors with tax documents and distributions) through the platform. A RealtyShares presentation for a funding round in February 2014 showed it earning fees of 3-5%.
That is comparatively high among RE crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment.
EASE OF USE
RealtyShares has a more involved sign-up process than other platforms we have test driven. While some sites initially ask only for an email address and password, RealtyShares seeks your phone number, address, employer, amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you.
If you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment, that might make you leery. But it also suggests RealtyShares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests, so it could be a plus for some. It offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with 11-14% return, 6-9 month hold, unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals.
After signing up, you see a countdown clock on the 30-day cooling off period. You are also directed to a helpful eight-minute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it. We liked this feature a lot.
LISTINGS
The page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow. There’s a deal dashboard, and tabs allow you to view an overview, financials, documents, photos, background on management and FAQs. One closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project, which provided a wealth of information.
WHAT AM I BUYING ON REALTYSHARES?
RealtyShares explains what you are actually buying this way: RealtyShares sets up a separate Limited Liability Company (LLC), for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform.  That LLC in turn will make a loan on a real estate property (in the case of a debt investment) or hold equity in an LLC or LP that in turn owns real estate property (in the case of an equity investment).  When you invest through RealtyShares, you own shares in that LLC.  Using this structure, you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level.
If you invest in a debt deal, the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments.  A share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.  If you invest in an equity investment opportunity (usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties), the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents and/or a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold. As with debt investments, a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.
HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?
As we’ve said before, real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices, and that holds even truer for RealtyShares. Experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals. Real estate by its nature can be a risky investment, and RealtyShares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals.
While offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum, RealtyShares could do a much better job of making its site transparent. It says it is currently affiliated with WealthForge, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA and member of SIPC (both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors), and that WealthForge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyShares.
But it’s unclear if SIPC protections apply to RealtyShares investments. Even if they do, they do not protect against loss in value, liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors. They would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer.
In truth, it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter, and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate.

There are various pluses and minuses with the service, but RealtyShares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors. Crowdfunding generally democratizes investing, making it available to even the smallest investors. The accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals. We’ll give RealtyShares a rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 stars, with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative.


Crowdfunding Website Reviews

We have singled out RealtyShares for the purpose of our first Real Estate Crowdfunding Site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye. Not the least of which is their forward-thinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using BitCoin. We love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments. This move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing, the Tech Crowd.

Last Updated June 27, 2016
Introduction
Thank you for visiting the RealtyShares website, owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. ("RealtyShares" or the "Company"). Please read these Terms of Service (this "Agreement" or the "Terms") carefully before using the services offered by RealtyShares. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at www.realtyshares.com, all other sites owned and operated by RealtyShares that redirect to www.realtyshares.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”). By accessing, browsing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, RealtyShares' Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by RealtyShares from time to time on the Site (collectively, the “Published Information”), each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by RealtyShares from time to time without notice to you. In order to access the Site and the Service, you must accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy and any Published Information.

Your use of the Site and Service is governed by the then current version of the Agreement in effect on the date of such use. RealtyShares may, at its sole discretion, modify and replace the Agreement at any time and without prior notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on the Site. By using and accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to review the then current version of the Agreement prior to each such use. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Terms have been published on the Service or otherwise provided to you constitutes your acknowledgement of, and binding agreement to, the then current Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and RealtyShares will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time the events giving rise to such dispute occurred. RealtyShares further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that RealtyShares and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.

Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and RealtyShares, including any customer, account or marketing agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with RealtyShares, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement, RealtyShares’ Privacy Policy and/or any Published Information, you are not eligible to participate in RealtyShares’ Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including investment managers ("Managers"), investors, including Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (collectively, "Investors"), and visitors to the Site, who in any way use the Site or Service provided by RealtyShares (in each case, a "User"). Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer rights on Users or third parties.

Authorized User
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. RealtyShares may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity. The Service is not available to any Users suspended or removed from the Site or Service by RealtyShares. By using the Service, you represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or Service.

Some of our services, and certain web pages of the Site, are available only to those Users who have been authorized by us to access those services and web pages. Only Users of the Service who are Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D Rule 501 adopted pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (“Accredited Investors”) with a valid User ID and password are authorized to access such services and web pages. In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. The authorization for such Accredited Investors may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening and/or identification verification. By registering for, accessing, browsing, and/or otherwise using the services and/or web pages for which access is restricted to Accredited Investors, you represent and agree that you are an Accredited Investor. Should you cease to be an Accredited Investor at any time, you agree to immediately notify RealtyShares and to refrain from accessing such restricted portions of the Site and/or Service. Further, because access to the restricted portions of the Site is limited by applicable law to Accredited Investors, you agree that you will not allow anyone to access such restricted portions of the Site, or share or disclose any information obtained through restricted portions of the Site with anyone, regardless of whether you believe such person or entity to also be an Accredited Investor.

As part of RealtyShares’ authorization process, each user shall be required to provide, among other things, a valid email address. In providing your email address and agreeing to these Terms of Service, each authorized user consents to receiving email notifications from RealtyShares concerning offerings. In some cases, users of the restricted portions of the Site may be required to confirm their status as an Accredited Investor. In order for RealtyShares to confirm that your representation regarding your status as an Accredited Investor is accurate when made and continues to be accurate from time to time, you agree to provide RealtyShares with all information and documentation reasonably required by RealtyShares to verify your status as an Accredited Investor, including (without limitation) delivering a completed Accredited Investor questionnaire, tax returns, brokerage statements, bank statements, resumes and other private financial information. Should you fail to provide any requested information and documentation that confirms your status as an Accredited Investor, RealtyShares may immediately suspend, block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site or Service. RealtyShares may change its eligibility criteria at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice.

Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where RealtyShares or North Capital is not authorized to provide such information or services.

Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided
The Service and securities offerings on this Site are available only to Accredited Investors who understand economic and investment risk and are willing to bear the consequences of that risk. Additionally, the securities offerings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private real estate investments. By using the Site or Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You acknowledge and agree that you have significant experience investing in investments of the type offered through the Site, including, without limitation, real estate, equities, notes and other securities, you understand that all of the investments offered through the Service are inherently very risky, and you understand the risks associated with the investments offered through the Site, and you are comfortable with the risk of losing your entire investment invested through the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that investing in private placements carries with it low liquidity concerns and long-term commitments and that the securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. For those reasons, these offerings may be made availabile only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify RealtyShares for violations of this Agreement.
You further represent and agree that you understand that RealtyShares does not guarantee the performance of any offerings made through the Site or Service and any and all projections, estimates, and expectations for investments offered through the Site or Service are merely opinions and should not be relied on for any purpose whatsoever. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You acknowledge and agree that RealtyShares is not a registered Investment Company or Investment Advisor within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, respectively. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.
RealtyShares is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal, or investment advisor and does not conduct any activity that would require such registration. Equity securities are offered through North Capital Private Securities Corporation(“North Capital”), member FINRA/SIPC. Individual personnel of RealtyShares may become registered representatives of North Capital.

Cottonwood Pkwy, Suite 500, Salt Lake City, UT 84121, tel: (888) 841-9984.

RealtyShares is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.

RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
CHAMBERS, District Judge.
Pending before the Court is Defendant's, Pechiney Rolled Products, LLC (Pechiney), Motion to Dismiss Or, In The Alternative, For Summary Judgment. For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED. 
I.
Under each of the standards described below, the facts of the case should be viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff. Prior to January 14, 2002, James Sanders was employed in Pechiney's casting department. Pechiney manufactures ingots and sells aluminum. Mr. Sanders was suspended from work and ultimately fired on January 14, 2002, for "substandard quality or quantity in work performance," a charge which Mr. Sanders disputes. Local 5668, United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO (Union) filed a grievance on behalf of Mr. Sanders, which reached a step five arbitration proceeding on August 1, 2002. On October 7, 2002, an Opinion and Award directed that Mr. Sanders be reinstated with full seniority but without back pay.
In preparation for returning to work, Mr. Sanders took a physical at Pechiney's medical office on October 16, 2002, which he passed. On October 22, 2002, Mr. *465 Sanders called his Union representative to inquire as to his date to return to work and was told that Pechiney would call him. Mr. Sanders called his Union representative a second time on October 28, 2002 and was told that the representative would contact Pechiney.
On November 6, 2002, Mr. Sanders received a certified letter dated October 29, 2002, from Pechiney, terminating Sanders' employment for violating the company's absentee program. The letter stated that Sanders had failed to report to work on October 24, 2002 or on any day since. The Union filed a second grievance which is currently set for arbitration before the original arbitrator on May 13, 2003.
Sanders filed the present action on January 9, 2003. Count I of the Complaint alleges breach of the collective bargaining agreement and seeks to enforce the October 7, 2002 arbitration award. Count II is entitled "Unfair Labor Practice" and alleges that the "employer's flagrant disregard for the collective bargaining process and for the rights of the plaintiff to be reinstated pursuant to the arbitration decision is an unfair labor practice pursuant to the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, (29 USCA § 158)." A hearing was held on the present motion on April 28, 2003. 
II.
Pechiney challenges both counts of the Complaint. With regard to Count I, Pechiney argues in the alternative that the Court should dismiss the count because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted or the Court should grant summary judgment because the Plaintiff has failed to establish an issue as to a material fact that would support his claim. Under Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defending party may move to dismiss if the pleading party has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted. A Rule 12(b) (6) motion tests the sufficiency of the pleading but does not resolve factual disputes, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses. Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992). In considering the motion, the claims must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and all allegations accepted as true. Id. See also Darcangelo v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 292 F.3d 181, 189 (4th Cir.2002). Dismissal is appropriate only when it appears beyond a doubt that no set of facts would entitle the pleader to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). The motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is viewed with disfavor and rarely granted. See Rogers v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 883 F.2d 324, 325 (4th Cir.1989) (reaffirmed in Mylan Lab., Inc. v. Matkari, 7 F.3d 1130, 1134 n. 4 (4th Cir.1993)).
To obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court will not "weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter[.]" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Instead, the Court will draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). See also Thompson v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 276 F.3d 651, 656 (4th Cir.2002).
Although the Court will view all underlying facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmoving party nonetheless must offer some "concrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his [or *466 her] favor[.]" Anderson, 477 U.S.  at 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505. Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmoving party has the burden of proof on an essential element of his or her case and does not make, after adequate time for discovery, a showing sufficient to establish that element. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The nonmoving party must satisfy this burden of proof by offering more than a mere "scintilla of evidence" in support of his or her position. Anderson, 477 U.S.  at 252,106 S. Ct. 2505.
With respect to Count II, Pechiney argues that the count should be dismissed because this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear it. A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure raises the fundamental question of whether a court is competent to hear and adjudicate the claims brought before it. Pechiney questions whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to sustain the Court's jurisdiction. "In that event, all the facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true and the plaintiff, in effect, is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a Rule 12(b) (6) consideration." Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir.1982). 
III.
Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, provides for suits by and against labor organizations. With respect to federal court jurisdiction, the statute provides: Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
29 U.S.C. § 185(a). The Supreme Court has also created a "hybrid 301" action by which employees may sue their employers for a breach of the collective-bargaining agreement: Such a suit, as a formal matter, comprises two causes of action. The suit against the employer rests on § 301, since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective-bargaining agreement. The suit against the union is one for breach of the union's duty of fair representation, which is implied under the scheme of the National Labor Relations Act. "Yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent. `To prevail against either the company or the Union, ... [employee-plaintiffs] must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the Union.'" The employee may, if he chooses, sue one defendant and not the other, but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or both. The suit is thus not a straightforward breach-of-contract suit under § 301 ... but a hybrid § 301/fair representation claim, amounting to "a direct challenge to `the private settlement of disputes under [the collective-bargaining agreement].'"
DelCostello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 163-5, 103 S. Ct. 2281, 76 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1983) (internal citations omitted). See also Thompson v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 276 F.3d 651 (4th Cir. 2002). Pechiney's motion is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege any breach of duty by the Union.
In his response to Pechiney's motion, Plaintiff contends that "the present action is simply one to enforce an arbitration award and in no sense a so-called `Hybrid 301' claim in which a breach by the Union of its duty of fair representation must first *467 be demonstrated." (Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 6). Thus, the primary issue presented to the Court is whether or not Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to sustain a claim for enforcing an arbitration award when Plaintiff has not alleged any wrongdoing by the Union.
Section 301 of the LMRA provides jurisdiction for suits in the district court between labor organizations, employers, and employees for violations of collective bargaining agreements. Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 562, 96 S. Ct. 1048, 47 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1976). Suits under § 301 "encompass those seeking to vindicate `uniquely personal' rights of employees such as wages." Id. (quoting Smith v. Evening News Ass'n, 371 U.S. 195, 198-200, 83 S. Ct. 267, 9 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1962)).
The Eleventh Circuit has addressed the required showing that the plaintiff in this case must make to prevail on his claim. As the courts have made clear, when an employee sues his employer under section 301 for breach of uniquely personal rights created by a collective bargaining agreement, after the employer has settled the controversy with the employee's union representative pursuant to binding grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement, the employee is "required in some way to show that the Union's duty to represent him fairly ... [has] been breached before he [is] entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim."
Diaz v. Schwerman Trucking Co., 709 F.2d 1371, 1375-76 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U.S. 56, 101 S. Ct. 1559, 67 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1981)). In Diaz, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the plaintiff-employee had alleged, inter alia, that the employer refused to comply with the arbitrator's decision and that the union did not enforce the decision, thereby breaching its duty of fair representation. Id. at 1375.
The Second Circuit has also addressed the case where an employee brings suit to challenge an arbitration award, holding: If there is no claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation, an individual employee represented by a union generally does not have standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding to which the union and the employer were the only parties. [Plaintiff] was not a party to the arbitration between the Union and [employer]. In addition, nothing in [plaintiffs] petition supports a claim for breach of duty on the part of the Union. Accordingly, [plaintiff] lacks standing to challenge the award, and her petition was properly dismissed.
Katir v. Columbia Univ., 15 F.3d 23, 24-25 (2nd Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted). The Eighth Circuit has also required a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation in failing to enforce the arbitration award in order for an employee to prevail against the employer. Livingstone v. Schnuck Mkt., Inc., 950 F.2d 579 (8th Cir.1991). The Seventh Circuit has noted that there are two exceptions to this rule, neither of which is applicable to the case at hand.[1]
*468 In a similar factual case to the one at hand, a court in this district recently affirmed the requirement that an employee must demonstrate bad faith on the part of the union to enforce an arbitration decision against the employer. Smoot v. Eagle Energy, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:98-0153, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22469 (S.D.W. Va.1998) (Knapp, J.). See also Cannelton Indus., Inc., v. District 17, United Mine Workers of Am., 46 F. Supp. 2d 500 (S.D.W.Va.1999) (Haden, C.J.). In Smoot, the district court evaluated the complaint based on the Katir principle that "individual union members do not generally have standing under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act to challenge, modify, or confirm arbitration awards." Id. The court then dismissed the action because "plaintiff herein is not a party to the arbitration award and, therefore, cannot seek to enforce the award even though the award addresses plaintiffs recall rights." Id. The court particularly relied on the fact that the union was contemporaneously seeking to enforce the arbitration through a separate legal action, in much the same way as the Union in the present case is doing through its grievance procedures.
Plaintiff makes several arguments to support the adequacy of the complaint. First, Plaintiff points out that the Union and Pechiney have agreed to an arbitration procedure for settling grievances. Plaintiff goes on to state "[n]aturally, in signing the CBA both Pechiney and the Union agreed to abide by the results of any arbitration award. In this case, the Union has done so but Pechiney has not. Because it has not, Mr. Sanders has a cause of action against Pechiney for breach of contract." (Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 7) (emphasis added). This is an inaccurate statement.
The cause of action in this case belongs to the Union, not to Mr. Sanders because Mr. Sanders was neither a party to the collective bargaining agreement nor to the arbitration. As the Fourth Circuit has recently stated, "[a]n individual employee represented by a union, ... generally does not have standing to challenge, modify, or confirm an arbitration award because he was not a party to the arbitration." Bryant v. Bell Atl. Md., Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 131 (4th Cir.2002). In Bryant, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff had not attempted to show that the union breached its duty of fair representation. Thus, the Court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to enforce the arbitration award. Id.
Plaintiff also relies on Williams v. United States Steel, 877 F. Supp. 1240 (N.D.Ind.) aff'd 70 F.3d 944 (7th Cir.1995). In Williams, an employee brought suit under § 301 to enforce an arbitration award that the union secured on his behalf. Defendant moved for summary judgment arguing that the complaint was timebarred based on the six-month limitation announced in DelCostello. The court found that, in the Seventh Circuit, unions did not have a duty to enforce an arbitration award. Therefore, the enforcement of the award is left to the employee through a straight § 301 suit, not a hybrid 301. Id. at 1244.
This Court declines to follow Williams for two reasons. First, the holding in Williams is contrary to the language discussed above in Bryant, which is the applicable law in this circuit. Second, it is extremely unclear as to whether Williams is even the governing law in the Seventh Circuit. In Cleveland v. Porca Co., 38 *469 F.3d 289 (7th Cir.1994), the Seventh Circuit was presented with a group of employees who sued to enforce an arbitration order under § 301. The employees filed suit against the employer for violation of the collective bargaining agreement and against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation. The Seventh Circuit first analyzed the claim against the union and found no breach of duty. Id. at 295-96. The court went on to analyze the claim against the employer, holding: The plaintiffs lack standing to enforce the arbitration award, however, because when employees are represented by a union they are not parties to either the collective bargaining agreement or any union company arbitration.... The plaintiffs also cannot maintain a claim against (the employer) under Section 301 for breach of the collective bargaining agreement. To state such a claim, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the employer breached the collective bargaining agreement and that the union violated its duty of fair representation.
Id. at 296-97. This Court is inclined to follow the holding of the Seventh Circuit rather than a district court therein, particularly since Bryant refers to and applies this language.
Next, Plaintiff relies on Teamsters Local Union No. 171 v. Keal Driveaway Co., 173 F.3d 915 (4th Cir.1999). Plaintiff singularly relies on Keal Driveaway's discussion of the hybrid suit wherein the court stated, "[i]t is true that an employee or local union may maintain separate actions for distinct injuries resulting from an employer's breach of contract and a union's breach of its duty of representation in the handling of a subsequent grievance." Id. at 919. This statement is inapplicable to Plaintiffs argument. First, Keal Driveaway involved a motion to dismiss based on the failure to join a necessary party where a union which lost an arbitration sued the employer, but not the union that won the arbitration. The issue was failure to add a necessary party, not standing to bring the action. Furthermore, the above quoted language only allows for suits to be brought by either an employee or a local union against both the employer and the union. The language does not, however, preempt the requirements of a suit by Sanders against Pechiney, one of which is to allege breach of duty of fair representation against the Union. See DelCostello, 462 U.S.  at 165, 103 S. Ct. 2281.
Finally, Plaintiff relies on Wilks v. American Bakeries Co., 563 F. Supp. 560 (W.D.N.C.1983). Plaintiff argues that Wilks is a factually similar case in which the employee was allowed to bring suit against the employer. Wilks, however, is not at all like the present case, because in Wilks both the employee and the union filed suit against the employer under § 301. There is no question that § 301 allows suits by unions against employers to enforce arbitration agreements. In the present case, not only is the Union a defendant, but Sanders has specifically denied any breach of a duty of fair representation by the Union. Wilks does not inform the present question.
Plaintiff argues that it seems "bizarre" to allow repeated arbitrations to settle disputes over the enforcement of previous awards. Plaintiffs remedy is to bring a suit against Pechiney and allege a breach by the Union if he believes the Union is breaching its duty of fair representation by failing to seek enforcement of a favorable arbitration award. This would prevent Plaintiffs "Russian dolls hypothetical" wherein an endless string of arbitrations is required to enforce a single decision. As noted during argument, however, the Union is grieving the plaintiffs claim that his firing was improper and a pretext to circumvent the arbitrator's award. 

*470 IV.
Count II of the Complaint alleges that Pechiney's failure to reinstate Plaintiff pursuant to the arbitration decision constitutes an unfair labor practice pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 158. Pechiney argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over this count because the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim. Plaintiff argues that since arbitration awards are enforced in federal courts, then this claim can also be heard in federal court. Plaintiff is again incorrect.
As discussed above, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to maintain its claim to enforce the arbitration decision. Therefore, if Count II merely alleges damages based on Pechiney's alleged refusal to implement the decision, then this count is repetitive and must also be dismissed. If, as Plaintiff seems to argue, this is a wholly separate count, then its jurisdiction must be separately assessed.
The Supreme Court has recently summarized the law with respect to federal court jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims: When a plaintiff challenges an action that is "arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the [NLRA]," this challenge is within the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB... But when a plaintiff alleges a breach of the duty of fair representation, this claim is cognizable in the first instance in federal court. The qualificationif her challenge is a duty of fair representation claimis important. The ritualistic incantation of the phrase "duty of fair representation" is insufficient to invoke the primary jurisdiction of federal courts. As we noted in Beck, "employees... may not circumvent the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB simply by casting statutory claims as violations of the union's duty of fair representation." When a plaintiffs only claim is that the union violated the NLRA, the plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdiction of the NLRB by characterizing this alleged statutory violation as a breach of the duty of fair representation. To invoke federal jurisdiction when the claim is based in part on a violation of the NLRA, there must be something more than just a claim that the union violated the statute. The plaintiff must adduce facts suggesting that the union's violation of the statute was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith ... The power of federal courts to resolve statutory issues under the NLRA when they arise as collateral matters in a duty of fair representation suit does not open the door for federal court first instance resolution of all statutory claims. Federal courts can only resolve § 7 and § 8 claims that are collateral to a duty of fair representation claim.
Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, 525 U.S. 33, 49, 119 S. Ct. 292, 142 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1998) (citing San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959); Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 177-183, 87 S. Ct. 903, 17 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1967); Communications Workers of Am. v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735, 108 S. Ct. 2641, 101 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1988)). Just as the Supreme Court has not allowed the bootstrapping of unfair labor practice claims by re-labeling them as a breach of the duty of fair representation, this Court will not allow identical bootstrapping by Plaintiffs characterization of his claim as enforcing an arbitration award. Plaintiffs Count II relies solely on 29 U.S.C. § 158 which is one of two sections that Garmon declares to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB. See Garmon, 359 U.S.  at 245, 79 S. Ct. 773. Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Pechiney to enforce the arbitration award. This Court is not fooled by Plaintiffs semantics and an examination of the specific paragraphs of *471 Count II reveal that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear this claim. 
V.
Given the dismissal of Counts I and II against Pechiney, there are now no claims remaining in the Complaint against Pechiney Although the Union is a named defendant in the case, Plaintiff admits that "the Complaint in its present form does not charge the Union with any wrongdoing at all. That is, under the pleadings as they presently exist, the Union is a party only because it played a factual role in the procession of Mr. Sander's return to employment inquiries." (Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 9). Therefore, because there are no remaining claims, this case is dismissed. 
VI.
For the reasons set forth herein, Count I of the Complaint is DISMISSED for failure to state a claim and Count II of the Complaint is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Defendant's motion is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that this action be dismissed.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to remove this action from the docket of this Court, to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties and to publish it on the Court's website.

First, an employee may defend a suit to challenge an arbitration award that is favorable to the union if the union chooses to both not defend it and acquiesce in the employee's defense. Id. Second, an employee may state a fair representation. sentation claim against the union under § 301, and the challenge or confirmation of the arbitration award is integral to the claim.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
CHAMBERS, District Judge.
Pending before the Court is Defendant's, Pechiney Rolled Products, LLC (Pechiney), Motion to Dismiss Or, In The Alternative, For Summary Judgment. For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED.

I.
Under each of the standards described below, the facts of the case should be viewed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff. Prior to January 14, 2002, James Sanders was employed in Pechiney's casting department. Pechiney manufactures ingots and sells aluminum. Mr. Sanders was suspended from work and ultimately fired on January 14, 2002, for "substandard quality or quantity in work performance," a charge which Mr. Sanders disputes. Local 5668, United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO (Union) filed a grievance on behalf of Mr. Sanders, which reached a step five arbitration proceeding on August 1, 2002. On October 7, 2002, an Opinion and Award directed that Mr. Sanders be reinstated with full seniority but without back pay.
In preparation for returning to work, Mr. Sanders took a physical at Pechiney's medical office on October 16, 2002, which he passed. On October 22, 2002, Mr. *465 Sanders called his Union representative to inquire as to his date to return to work and was told that Pechiney would call him. Mr. Sanders called his Union representative a second time on October 28, 2002 and was told that the representative would contact Pechiney.
On November 6, 2002, Mr. Sanders received a certified letter dated October 29, 2002, from Pechiney, terminating Sanders' employment for violating the company's absentee program. The letter stated that Sanders had failed to report to work on October 24, 2002 or on any day since. The Union filed a second grievance which is currently set for arbitration before the original arbitrator on May 13, 2003.
Sanders filed the present action on January 9, 2003. Count I of the Complaint alleges breach of the collective bargaining agreement and seeks to enforce the October 7, 2002 arbitration award. Count II is entitled "Unfair Labor Practice" and alleges that the "employer's flagrant disregard for the collective bargaining process and for the rights of the plaintiff to be reinstated pursuant to the arbitration decision is an unfair labor practice pursuant to the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, (29 USCA § 158)." A hearing was held on the present motion on April 28, 2003.

II.
Pechiney challenges both counts of the Complaint. With regard to Count I, Pechiney argues in the alternative that the Court should dismiss the count because Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted or the Court should grant summary judgment because the Plaintiff has failed to establish an issue as to a material fact that would support his claim. Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defending party may move to dismiss if the pleading party has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of the pleading but does not resolve factual disputes, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses. Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir.1992). In considering the motion, the claims must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and all allegations accepted as true. Id. See also Darcangelo v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 292 F.3d 181, 189 (4th Cir.2002). Dismissal is appropriate only when it appears beyond a doubt that no set of facts would entitle the pleader to relief. Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). The motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is viewed with disfavor and rarely granted. See Rogers v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., 883 F.2d 324, 325 (4th Cir.1989) (reaffirmed in Mylan Lab., Inc. v. Matkari, 7 F.3d 1130, 1134 n. 4 (4th Cir.1993)).
To obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court will not "weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter[.]" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Instead, the Court will draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). See also Thompson v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 276 F.3d 651, 656 (4th Cir.2002).
Although the Court will view all underlying facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmoving party nonetheless must offer some "concrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his [or *466 her] favor[.]" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505. Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmoving party has the burden of proof on an essential element of his or her case and does not make, after adequate time for discovery, a showing sufficient to establish that element. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The nonmoving party must satisfy this burden of proof by offering more than a mere "scintilla of evidence" in support of his or her position. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252,106 S. Ct. 2505.
With respect to Count II, Pechiney argues that the count should be dismissed because this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear it. A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure raises the fundamental question of whether a court is competent to hear and adjudicate the claims brought before it. Pechiney questions whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to sustain the Court's jurisdiction. "In that event, all the facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true and the plaintiff, in effect, is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration." Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir.1982).

III.
Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, provides for suits by and against labor organizations. With respect to federal court jurisdiction, the statute provides:
Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.
29 U.S.C. § 185(a). The Supreme Court has also created a "hybrid 301" action by which employees may sue their employers for a breach of the collective-bargaining agreement:
Such a suit, as a formal matter, comprises two causes of action. The suit against the employer rests on § 301, since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective-bargaining agreement. The suit against the union is one for breach of the union's duty of fair representation, which is implied under the scheme of the National Labor Relations Act. "Yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent. `To prevail against either the company or the Union, ... [employee-plaintiffs] must not only show that their discharge was contrary to the contract but must also carry the burden of demonstrating breach of duty by the Union.'" The employee may, if he chooses, sue one defendant and not the other, but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or both. The suit is thus not a straightforward breach-of-contract suit under § 301 ... but a hybrid § 301/fair representation claim, amounting to "a direct challenge to `the private settlement of disputes under [the collective-bargaining agreement].'"
DelCostello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 163-5, 103 S. Ct. 2281, 76 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1983) (internal citations omitted). See also Thompson v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 276 F.3d 651 (4th Cir. 2002). Pechiney's motion is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege any breach of duty by the Union.
In his response to Pechiney's motion, Plaintiff contends that "the present action is simply one to enforce an arbitration award and in no sense a so-called `Hybrid 301' claim in which a breach by the Union of its duty of fair representation must first *467 be demonstrated." (Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 6). Thus, the primary issue presented to the Court is whether or not Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to sustain a claim for enforcing an arbitration award when Plaintiff has not alleged any wrongdoing by the Union.
Section 301 of the LMRA provides jurisdiction for suits in the district court between labor organizations, employers, and employees for violations of collective bargaining agreements. Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 562, 96 S. Ct. 1048, 47 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1976). Suits under § 301 "encompass those seeking to vindicate `uniquely personal' rights of employees such as wages." Id. (quoting Smith v. Evening News Ass'n, 371 U.S. 195, 198-200, 83 S. Ct. 267, 9 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1962)).
The Eleventh Circuit has addressed the required showing that the plaintiff in this case must make to prevail on his claim.
As the courts have made clear, when an employee sues his employer under section 301 for breach of uniquely personal rights created by a collective bargaining agreement, after the employer has settled the controversy with the employee's union representative pursuant to binding grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement, the employee is "required in some way to show that the Union's duty to represent him fairly ... [has] been breached before he [is] entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim."
Diaz v. Schwerman Trucking Co., 709 F.2d 1371, 1375-76 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U.S. 56, 101 S. Ct. 1559, 67 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1981)). In Diaz, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the plaintiff-employee had alleged, inter alia, that the employer refused to comply with the arbitrator's decision and that the union did not enforce the decision, thereby breaching its duty of fair representation. Id. at 1375.
The Second Circuit has also addressed the case where an employee brings suit to challenge an arbitration award, holding:
If there is no claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation, an individual employee represented by a union generally does not have standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding to which the union and the employer were the only parties. [Plaintiff] was not a party to the arbitration between the Union and [employer]. In addition, nothing in [plaintiffs] petition supports a claim for breach of duty on the part of the Union. Accordingly, [plaintiff] lacks standing to challenge the award, and her petition was properly dismissed.
Katir v. Columbia Univ., 15 F.3d 23, 24-25 (2nd Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted). The Eighth Circuit has also required a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation in failing to enforce the arbitration award in order for an employee to prevail against the employer. Livingstone v. Schnuck Mkt., Inc., 950 F.2d 579 (8th Cir.1991). The Seventh Circuit has noted that there are two exceptions to this rule, neither of which is applicable to the case at hand.[1]
*468 In a similar factual case to the one at hand, a court in this district recently affirmed the requirement that an employee must demonstrate bad faith on the part of the union to enforce an arbitration decision against the employer. Smoot v. Eagle Energy, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:98-0153, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22469 (S.D.W. Va.1998) (Knapp, J.). See also Cannelton Indus., Inc., v. District 17, United Mine Workers of Am., 46 F. Supp. 2d 500 (S.D.W.Va.1999) (Haden, C.J.). In Smoot, the district court evaluated the complaint based on the Katir principle that "individual union members do not generally have standing under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act to challenge, modify, or confirm arbitration awards." Id. The court then dismissed the action because "plaintiff herein is not a party to the arbitration award and, therefore, cannot seek to enforce the award even though the award addresses plaintiffs recall rights." Id. The court particularly relied on the fact that the union was contemporaneously seeking to enforce the arbitration through a separate legal action, in much the same way as the Union in the present case is doing through its grievance procedures.
Plaintiff makes several arguments to support the adequacy of the complaint. First, Plaintiff points out that the Union and Pechiney have agreed to an arbitration procedure for settling grievances. Plaintiff goes on to state "[n]aturally, in signing the CBA both Pechiney and the Union agreed to abide by the results of any arbitration award. In this case, the Union has done so but Pechiney has not. Because it has not, Mr. Sanders has a cause of action against Pechiney for breach of contract." (Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 7) (emphasis added). This is an inaccurate statement.
The cause of action in this case belongs to the Union, not to Mr. Sanders because Mr. Sanders was neither a party to the collective bargaining agreement nor to the arbitration. As the Fourth Circuit has recently stated, "[a]n individual employee represented by a union, ... generally does not have standing to challenge, modify, or confirm an arbitration award because he was not a party to the arbitration." Bryant v. Bell Atl. Md., Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 131 (4th Cir.2002). In Bryant, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff had not attempted to show that the union breached its duty of fair representation. Thus, the Court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to enforce the arbitration award. Id.
Plaintiff also relies on Williams v. United States Steel, 877 F. Supp. 1240 (N.D.Ind.) aff'd 70 F.3d 944 (7th Cir.1995). In Williams, an employee brought suit under § 301 to enforce an arbitration award that the union secured on his behalf. Defendant moved for summary judgment arguing that the complaint was timebarred based on the six-month limitation announced in DelCostello. The court found that, in the Seventh Circuit, unions did not have a duty to enforce an arbitration award. Therefore, the enforcement of the award is left to the employee through a straight § 301 suit, not a hybrid 301. Id. at 1244.
This Court declines to follow Williams for two reasons. First, the holding in Williams is contrary to the language discussed above in Bryant, which is the applicable law in this circuit. Second, it is extremely unclear as to whether Williams is even the governing law in the Seventh Circuit. In Cleveland v. Porca Co., 38 *469 F.3d 289 (7th Cir.1994), the Seventh Circuit was presented with a group of employees who sued to enforce an arbitration order under § 301. The employees filed suit against the employer for violation of the collective bargaining agreement and against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation. The Seventh Circuit first analyzed the claim against the union and found no breach of duty. Id. at 295-96. The court went on to analyze the claim against the employer, holding:
The plaintiffs lack standing to enforce the arbitration award, however, because when employees are represented by a union they are not parties to either the collective bargaining agreement or any union company arbitration.... The plaintiffs also cannot maintain a claim against (the employer) under Section 301 for breach of the collective bargaining agreement. To state such a claim, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the employer breached the collective bargaining agreement and that the union violated its duty of fair representation.
Id. at 296-97. This Court is inclined to follow the holding of the Seventh Circuit rather than a district court therein, particularly since Bryant refers to and applies this language.
Next, Plaintiff relies on Teamsters Local Union No. 171 v. Keal Driveaway Co., 173 F.3d 915 (4th Cir.1999). Plaintiff singularly relies on Keal Driveaway's discussion of the hybrid suit wherein the court stated, "[i]t is true that an employee or local union may maintain separate actions for distinct injuries resulting from an employer's breach of contract and a union's breach of its duty of representation in the handling of a subsequent grievance." Id. at 919. This statement is inapplicable to Plaintiffs argument. First, Keal Driveaway involved a motion to dismiss based on the failure to join a necessary party where a union which lost an arbitration sued the employer, but not the union that won the arbitration. The issue was failure to add a necessary party, not standing to bring the action. Furthermore, the above quoted language only allows for suits to be brought by either an employee or a local union against both the employer and the union. The language does not, however, preempt the requirements of a suit by Sanders against Pechiney, one of which is to allege breach of duty of fair representation against the Union. See DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 165, 103 S. Ct. 2281.
Finally, Plaintiff relies on Wilks v. American Bakeries Co., 563 F. Supp. 560 (W.D.N.C.1983). Plaintiff argues that Wilks is a factually similar case in which the employee was allowed to bring suit against the employer. Wilks, however, is not at all like the present case, because in Wilks both the employee and the union filed suit against the employer under § 301. There is no question that § 301 allows suits by unions against employers to enforce arbitration agreements. In the present case, not only is the Union a defendant, but Sanders has specifically denied any breach of a duty of fair representation by the Union. Wilks does not inform the present question.
Plaintiff argues that it seems "bizarre" to allow repeated arbitrations to settle disputes over the enforcement of previous awards. Plaintiffs remedy is to bring a suit against Pechiney and allege a breach by the Union if he believes the Union is breaching its duty of fair representation by failing to seek enforcement of a favorable arbitration award. This would prevent Plaintiffs "Russian dolls hypothetical" wherein an endless string of arbitrations is required to enforce a single decision. As noted during argument, however, the Union is grieving the plaintiffs claim that his firing was improper and a pretext to circumvent the arbitrator's award.


*470 IV.
Count II of the Complaint alleges that Pechiney's failure to reinstate Plaintiff pursuant to the arbitration decision constitutes an unfair labor practice pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 158. Pechiney argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over this count because the National Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim. Plaintiff argues that since arbitration awards are enforced in federal courts, then this claim can also be heard in federal court. Plaintiff is again incorrect.
As discussed above, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to maintain its claim to enforce the arbitration decision. Therefore, if Count II merely alleges damages based on Pechiney's alleged refusal to implement the decision, then this count is repetitive and must also be dismissed. If, as Plaintiff seems to argue, this is a wholly separate count, then its jurisdiction must be separately assessed.
The Supreme Court has recently summarized the law with respect to federal court jurisdiction over unfair labor practice claims:
When a plaintiff challenges an action that is "arguably subject to § 7 or § 8 of the [NLRA]," this challenge is within the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB... But when a plaintiff alleges a breach of the duty of fair representation, this claim is cognizable in the first instance in federal court. The qualificationif her challenge is a duty of fair representation claimis important. The ritualistic incantation of the phrase "duty of fair representation" is insufficient to invoke the primary jurisdiction of federal courts. As we noted in Beck, "employees... may not circumvent the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB simply by casting statutory claims as violations of the union's duty of fair representation." When a plaintiffs only claim is that the union violated the NLRA, the plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdiction of the NLRB by characterizing this alleged statutory violation as a breach of the duty of fair representation. To invoke federal jurisdiction when the claim is based in part on a violation of the NLRA, there must be something more than just a claim that the union violated the statute. The plaintiff must adduce facts suggesting that the union's violation of the statute was arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith ... The power of federal courts to resolve statutory issues under the NLRA when they arise as collateral matters in a duty of fair representation suit does not open the door for federal court first instance resolution of all statutory claims. Federal courts can only resolve § 7 and § 8 claims that are collateral to a duty of fair representation claim.
Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, 525 U.S. 33, 49, 119 S. Ct. 292, 142 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1998) (citing San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S. Ct. 773, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1959); Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 177-183, 87 S. Ct. 903, 17 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1967); Communications Workers of Am. v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735, 108 S. Ct. 2641, 101 L. Ed. 2d 634 (1988)). Just as the Supreme Court has not allowed the bootstrapping of unfair labor practice claims by re-labeling them as a breach of the duty of fair representation, this Court will not allow identical bootstrapping by Plaintiffs characterization of his claim as enforcing an arbitration award. Plaintiffs Count II relies solely on 29 U.S.C. § 158 which is one of two sections that Garmon declares to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB. See Garmon, 359 U.S. at 245, 79 S. Ct. 773. Plaintiff has failed to state a claim against Pechiney to enforce the arbitration award. This Court is not fooled by Plaintiffs semantics and an examination of the specific paragraphs of *471 Count II reveal that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear this claim.

V.
Given the dismissal of Counts I and II against Pechiney, there are now no claims remaining in the Complaint against Pechiney Although the Union is a named defendant in the case, Plaintiff admits that "the Complaint in its present form does not charge the Union with any wrongdoing at all. That is, under the pleadings as they presently exist, the Union is a party only because it played a factual role in the procession of Mr. Sander's return to employment inquiries." (Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Pechiney's Motion to Dismiss at 9). Therefore, because there are no remaining claims, this case is dismissed.

VI.
For the reasons set forth herein, Count I of the Complaint is DISMISSED for failure to state a claim and Count II of the Complaint is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Defendant's motion is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that this action be dismissed.
The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to remove this action from the docket of this Court, to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties and to publish it on the Court's website.
