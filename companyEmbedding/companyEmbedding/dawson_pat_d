Pat Dawson

Pat Dawson

Director


Pat D. Dawson serves as a director on the board of the Midland Baseball Foundation.

His corporate position has been group president for the Polyurethanes business of The Dow Chemical Company. In December 2008, Dawson was appointed president of Dow Asia, overseeing all of Dow's operations in Asia.

Dawson began his career with Dow in 1980 in the Market Development Program in the New York Sales office. In the 1990s, he held a series of sales, marketing, manufacturing positions in Performance Products. Dawson was relocated from Hong Kong to Midland in 1999, and was appointed business vice president for the Oxide Derivatives global business unit shortly thereafter. He assumed the role of group president of the Polyurethanes business in 2004, before being appointed to his current position.

Dawson received a bachelor's degree in agronomy in 1979 and a masters in agricultural economics/management from Purdue University in 1980. He played 4 years on the Boilermaker baseball team, and credits baseball for shaping many of his views on how to compete in the business world, such as building winning business teams with the right people and customers.

Dawson and his wife Ann have two sons, Jon (21) and Eric (18), and a daughter Casey (20). They have been Loons season ticket holders since the inaugural season.
