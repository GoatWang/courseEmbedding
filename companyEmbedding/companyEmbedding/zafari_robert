  First sentence should begin: Ingersoll-Rand plc (NYSE:IR) today announced the appointment of Robert Zafari... (sted Ingersoll-Rand plc (NYSE:IR) today announced the appointment of Robert Zarfari...)  The corrected release reads:   INGERSOLL RAND NAMES ROBERT ZAFARI PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES SECTOR   Ingersoll-Rand plc (NYSE:IR) today announced the appointment of Robert Zafari, a 10-year company veteran, as president of its Industrial Technologies Sector (ITS), effective July 1, 2010.  Since 2009, Zafari, 52, has been president of Ingersoll Rand’s Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) region of its Climate Solutions Sector headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. He will report to Michael W. Lamach, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and be based in Davidson, NC. Zafari also will be recommended to the Board of Directors for election as an officer. He will be a member of the company's Enterprise Leadership Team.  "Our ITS business is emerging from the economic downturn strongly positioned for success, making this an ideal time for a growth-driven leader like Robert Zafari,” said Lamach. “Robert is an outstanding, results-oriented leader with an impressive track record of accomplishments in diverse businesses on multiple continents. His extensive international experience, strong operational skills, aggressive growth orientation, and proven leadership have prepared him well for this new challenge, and I am confident that he is the right leader as the business rapidly recovers and continues to grow globally.”  In his new role, Robert Zafari succeeds James Bolch, who has been named chief executive officer of Exide Technologies.  “We are grateful for Jim’s many contributions to Ingersoll Rand and the success of our Industrial Technologies business. We wish him the best in his new endeavor,” said Lamach.  The Industrial Technologies Sector, with 2009 revenues of $2.2 billion, provides products, services and solutions that enhance customers' energy efficiency, productivity and operations, ranging from Ingersoll Rand® complete compressed air systems, tools and pumps to material and fluid handling systems, to ClubCar®, the global leader in golf and utility vehicles for businesses and individuals.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
