Big rig? Let LAMPHUS warn other drivers where you are

July 27, 2017July 26, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley If you drive a big rig with a car in tow, you might want to alert some distracted drivers around you to the size of your rig, and your limited turning radius and stopping ability. There is no better way than with an audio broadcast system that will be easily heard by those around you. But...

Dutch company Epsilon solves RV battery limitations

July 20, 2017July 20, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley A new lithium battery, developed by Dutch battery expert Super B, offers campers and boaters huge power and energy reserves, so people no longer have to worry about energy provision, charging points or limited power. The Epsilon weighs substantially less and will last five times longer than conventional batteries, is fully charged within one hour and...

Slide-out drawers add storage space under tables, cabinets

July 18, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley If you have an RV that is smaller than a rolling mansion, you likely could use some additional storage space. Like where do you keep your wine bottle opener, the chopsticks when you bring in Chinese takeout, or your favorite chef’s knife? The Add-A-Drawer can put those daily-use items just a slide away from use –...

Shurhold polishers turn chores into easy tasks

July 17, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley From giving new life to a sun-faded classic to keeping a late model RV in showroom-like condition, nothing beats a quality polisher. Shurhold Industries offers three models that fit any need or budget and turn tiresome chores into simple, easy tasks. Shurhold’s most popular model is the random 8 mm orbit Dual Action Polisher. It makes...

PowRyte 12-Volt Auto Air Compressor/Digital Tire Inflator

July 16, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley PowRyte Elite 12-Volt DC Digital Tire Inflator is perfect to inflate tires on cars, SUVs, light trucks, sports balls, road bicycles, motorcycles, air mats, toys and so on. It can plug into a 12v DC socket, has a screw-on hose, and works much better than any lever-action connector. This tire inflator features auto shut off when...

Light your campfire in any conditions with Instafire

July 16, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley If you enjoy leaning into a smoky campfire, blowing into the fire to encourage it to start — and to keep it going — you need not read this. But if you would like to throw a little powdery material into a pile, light a match to it, and see it burn despite the wind (and...

Awning De-Flapper reduces stress on you and your awning

July 12, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley When the wind comes up — and it will — which happens all too frequently in the mountains during a summer camping trip, it will not only be annoying to listen to the flap-flapping of the awning whipping in the wind, but it can also cause the awning to rip or tear. It won’t be necessary...

Simplify your life with FloJet portable RV waste pump

July 7, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley Dumping your RV waste tanks is the slowest, messiest job in the RV world, but not anymore! The FloJet Portable RV Waste Pump system chomps down the waste in your holding tanks to garden-hose size at 25 gallons per minute. Macerators are one of the greatest parts invented for RVers. The FloJet Portable Waste Pump breaks...

Want to find me? Look for my flag

June 28, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley If you’ve been to Quartzsite or an RV rally you’ve seen lots of RVs flying flags of all types from long poles extending way above their rig. They are more than just decorative, they also enable you to identify and find your rig from among the many parked helter-skelter across the desert floor or in a...

Jazz up your backsplash with peel-and-stick Smart Tiles

June 22, 2017July 15, 2017 Bob 


		  By Bob Difley Few people redecorate after purchasing a new or used RV. There’s really not much you can do other than replace what is already there with something different, and that can become expensive. An easier way you can add an element of customization to your RV is to install tiles to certain vertical surfaces which, in addition...

It's a wonder our luggage ever made it from Point A to Point B before the advent of Trunkster, a self-weighing suitcase with a built-in USB charging system and a location tracker that debuted in 2015. And how did we survive long-haul flights behind screaming toddlers without Doppler Labs' wireless, sound-filtering earbuds? From major technological upgrades (automatic cellphone reception wherever in the world you are, a super-sleek external hard drive that is only 7mm thin) to convenient accessories you never even knew you wanted (taco-inspired cord organizers, an eyemask filled with soothing lavender) the best travel products of 2015 promise to simplify and improve your travels, whether you're constantly on the road for business or a person who lives for their annual family vacation. 
There's something for everyone on this list—gift ideas abound, and there are plenty of ways to spoil yourself, too. Hyper-organized individual will find solace in an incredibly efficient wallet with separate pockets and slots for your passport and boarding pass, as well as business cards, credit cards, and cash. Pampered passengers and fashionistas can now pack fold-flat kicks with interchangeable soles and tops, carry-on size Jack Black grooming products, and a scarf-blanket combo by Club Monaco perfect for getting cozy on chilly flights. 
The very best products of the year aren't just great for packing on trip: they're clever, well-built, and attractive items that will carry you across the world and through the year to come. (Looking for trip ideas for next year? Might we point you in the direction of T+L's Best Places to Travel in 2016.)
Hand-painted designer luggage tags, the best new hiking boot for living out all your Wild adventures, and toiletry organizers: these items are our favorite wish list and gift guide items of 2015. Click through to see what products have topped T+L's list of the best travel products of 2015.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
