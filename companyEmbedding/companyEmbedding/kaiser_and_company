Asbestos Products Manufacturers
Even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world, the industry continues to thrive. Concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than 50 nations — including the entire European Union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use. Strict U.S. regulations took hold in the 1970s. Yet countries like Russia, China, Brazil and Kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale.

At the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life. Since the late 1800s, American companies like the Johns Manville Corporation amassed great wealth by mining, manufacturing and selling asbestos-containing products. Centuries later, medical evidence revealed Johns Manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers.
In decades past, asbestos use was far more pervasive in the United States. Contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding, construction, power generation and heavy manufacturing. Since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the 1970s, asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy. In many cases, companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits.

While medical evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause life-threatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, the consumption of contaminated products in the United States and many other countries continues. According to a 2011 inventory of more than 60,000 asbestos-laden products, approximately 600 companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year.

Fast Fact: In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal acquired Mundet Cork, inheriting more than $700 million current and future asbestos liabilities.

History of Manufacturing

Although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years, it was only during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s that the industry flourished. A natural resistance to heat, chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications. Soon enough, manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines, piping and locomotives. Thousands of other uses later emerged, and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers, gaskets, cement, roofing materials and automotive brake pads.


By the early 20th century, some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers. But rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards, some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation. Internal documents indicate that Johns Manville executives were aware of the risks as early as 1934. The company conducted private medical studies around this time, and the negative results remained confidential for decades.


Asbestos use increased throughout World War II, largely because of military shipbuilding contracts. The U.S. government required asbestos insulation be used in U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. For several decades after the war, hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products.

In addition to Johns Manville, other leading asbestos manufacturers include:

Owens Corning/Fibreboard Corp.
Raybestos-Manhattan Co.
National Gypsum Corporation
W.R. Grace & Co.
Celotex Corp.


By the 1960s, scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestos's harmful effects. One landmark occupational study conducted by Dr. Irving Selikoff in 1964 showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers. Results indicated that between 1943 and 1962, an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Selikoff's findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use. The result was a significant downturn for America's asbestos industry.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dealt another blow to the industry with the Clean Air Act of 1970. It established the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants. Several new regulations directly affected the industry, specifically companies that milled, sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials. By the late 1970s, many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products.


Although the U.S. Geological Survey asserts that U.S. asbestos use has fallen 99.9 percent since 1973, it is not yet banned in the United States. Limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials, building materials like cement and in various textiles.

Fast Fact: A C & S stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in 1974, but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade.

Products

During the peak era of asbestos consumption, it was incorporated into approximately 3,000 types of products. One of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products, a use that spanned industries including construction, shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing.


Countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos, including ceiling tiles, joint compounds, cement, drywall and roofing materials. These products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions, as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air.


The toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope, cloth and garments. Shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient.


Another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry. Many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction, such as gaskets and brake pads, contained some percentage of asbestos.

Industries & Occupations

According to the World Health Organization, about 125 million people experience workplace exposure worldwide. By far, the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral. These activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air.


Another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction. While drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks, many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project.


Shipyard workers, especially during the World War II era, experienced heavy exposure as well. Tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels, and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous. Also at risk were pipefitters, boiler workers and electricians who serviced U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships.


Litigation & Specific Lawsuits


A staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades, jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos. According to one litigation report from 2002, an estimated 730,000 people filed related claims against at least 8,400 corporations.


Some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimillion-dollar verdicts or out-of-court settlements. When courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death, they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and loss of consortium. Many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings.


In one standout 2005 case, U.S. Steel was ordered to pay $250 million to Roby Whittington, the wife of a former U.S. Steel employee who died of mesothelioma. Several other manufacturers defended the case, but U.S. Steel was found 100 percent liable for Whittington’s death. Georgia-Pacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the jury awarded Mrs. Whittington $50 million in damages and $200 million in punitive damages.


A San Francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to Alfred Todak, holding more than 25 firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis. A former electrician, Todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard Navy vessels from 1960 to 1976. Eighteen firms settled with Todak out of court for a total of $4.2 million, and Foster Wheeler Ltd. contributed 30 percent of the jury’s $22.7 million verdict. Todak’s wife also received $11 million for related losses.


More recently, a 2011 lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of $22 million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets. The gasket manufacturers, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Goodyear Canada, were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of Walter Koczur and Eugene McCarthy, despite both being longtime smokers.

Fast Fact: Pittsburgh Corning announced in 2009 that it would pay out $825 million in cash over the next 15 years to cover asbestos-related claims.


Trust Funds


With multibillion-dollar liabilities looming, many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain, yet steadily rising, costs of legal compensation. The U.S. government estimates that more than 100 companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation, including industry giants like National Gypsum, Dana Corporation and EaglePicher Industries.


As part of their reorganization plans, companies often create personal injury trusts. Forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court, designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation. Bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities.


Since Johns Manville created the first trust in 1987, nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust. By 2011, these trusts had awarded a total of $17.5 billion. Some of the largest trusts include:

Asbestos Exposure

Asbestos Exposure
Asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a rare, aggressive and incurable cancer. 
Asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present: At home, a public building such as a school or government office, a war fought on foreign soil or on the job.




Click to expand

In fact, occupational exposure is the No. 1 cause of asbestos disease. That means roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, firefighters, auto mechanics, insulators, factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure.
Those who worked in construction, shipyards, power plants, oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job.
U.S. military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products, especially on Navy ships.
For much of the 20th century, until its long-term toxicity became well known, thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance, versatility and tensile strength.

How Exposure Happens
Asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers. While no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe, most problems arise after repeated and long-term exposures to the carcinogen. 
Environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer, but it still happens regularly. Most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos, but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems.







"Asbestos-related disease is 100 percent preventable. That fact motivates me. It should motivate all of us. If we stopped using asbestos, by definition, we could stop asbestos disease." — Dr. Ken Takahashi, director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute


Harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings. Home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos. When asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut, sanded, drilled or disturbed in any way, microscopic fibers enter the air.
For example, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) took issue with the sandblasting practices of Alaska-based shipbuilding and repair facility Seward Ship's Drydock. The ADEC issued Seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled "fugitive particulate emissions" at its sandblasting operations.
If workers sandblasted asbestos-containing materials, such as paint, insulation or joint compounds, off of a vessel, the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area, and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them.
Fibers can remain airborne for hours, placing anyone nearby in danger. Once inhaled, they can become trapped in the respiratory tract, where they may stay for life.
Health Risks of Exposure
Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation, making breathing increasingly difficult.
They eventually will cause scarring, which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. In the early stages, symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until 20 to 50 years after the initial exposure.
Each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure. An estimated 10,000 Americans die annually from an asbestos-related disease. 
Currently, an estimated 200,000 people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestos-related illness.

Pleural plaques: These are the most common indication of asbestos exposure. They are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs.
Asbestosis: Asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally.
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not directly caused by asbestos, but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease.
Mesothelioma: This is a rare, aggressive and incurable asbestos-caused cancer.
Lung Cancer: Asbestos-related lung cancer accounts for approximately 4 percent of all lung cancer cases. Asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer. 

Where Exposure Occurs
Exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments, using asbestos-containing products or working in certain occupations, including the U.S. military. Exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters.


Military
Every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces incorporated asbestos. People on U.S. Navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early 1900s to the 1970s were most at risk. Since that time, thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service.

Battleships
Aircraft Carriers
Cruisers
Auxiliary Vessels
Submarines
Destroyers
Frigates

Products
Thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers. Asbestos may be found in insulation, drywall, ceiling and floor tiles, cements, paint and more. Most homes and commercial buildings built before 1980 contain asbestos products.
Search our asbestos products index


Occupations
Workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job. Drywall tapers, electricians, firefighters, auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk. While asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past, today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other job-related health risks.
See if your occupation was at risk for exposure


Job Sites
Asbestos exposure may occur while on the job. Many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities, placing millions of workers at risk for exposure.

Shipyards
Power Plants
Metal Works
Schools
Chemical Plants
Oil Refineries



Environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining, the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
In 2016, the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years, but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas. 
The study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising.
Researchers at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center conducted a similar study in 2015 that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in Nevada.
Northern California is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos. 
9/11 Attack on the World Trade Center
The terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, released more than 2,000 tons of asbestos into the air, causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months.
According to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, about 70 percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems. It found that 28 percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests. Researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble, along with nearby residents, for long-term health consequences related to asbestos and other toxic building materials.

Read About the Asbestos Cover Up



A 2009 study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant. The study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and other asbestos-related conditions in Shubra El-Kheima, Egypt, an industrial city containing the Sigwart Company asbestos plant. It compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant, those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure. In total, the study had more than 4,000 participants.
The rate of MPM was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure, with 2.8 percent of this group having the cancer. The group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only 0.8 percent. As expected, the control group had the fewest incidences, with a rate of 0.1 percent.
These rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening. Overall, the study found a slightly higher, but still comparable, rate of asbestos-related illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents.

If asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure, there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed. It is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks.
Secondhand Exposure
People can get an asbestos-related disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral. Secondhand exposure, or indirect exposure, can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure.
While any kind of exposure is much less common today than even 20 years ago, women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the mid-20th century.
At that time, men comprised the majority of the industrial working class. The occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestos-containing products. Workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair, skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them.
Occurrences of Secondhand Exposure
Secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children. If children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age, they may develop an asbestos-related disease in their adult years. There are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure.



Laundry
The clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure. Because of the jagged structure of the fibers, the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing. Anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure.





Furniture
If a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home, fibers could have become embedded in the couch, chairs, carpet, bed and other pieces of furniture.





Hugs
If a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair, skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse, family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen. Some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work.
While family members didn't have any direct contact with asbestos-containing products, the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life.
Between 1941 and 1954, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City studied the health of 679 family members from the 1,664 workers employed at a factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers' family members. Sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former Patterson factory workers 20 years after the factory shut down.

Legal Claims for Secondhand Exposure 
Like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos, claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation. In order to bring a successful legal claim, they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers. This usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job.


John Panza Jr., diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012.

For example, John Panza Jr., a 40-year-old English professor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012. For more than 30 years, his father worked at a brake plant where National Friction Products Corp. products were drilled and abraded. As a child, Panza helped his father wash his work clothes. In 2012, Panza filed a lawsuit against National Friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the company's products that contaminated his father's clothes.
In 2013, an Ohio jury found National Friction liable for Panza's illness. It ordered the company to pay Panza and his wife $27.5 million. The award included $515,000 in economic damages, $12 million in noneconomic damages and $15 million for the wife's loss of consortium claim. 
Protecting Yourself and Loved Ones
Despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life, people can protect themselves by being vigilant. 
Workers should use protective equipment provided by employers. It is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices. Approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers.
It also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family. Any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site. Showers should be taken before returning home.
Safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems.
If you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t adequately protecting you from asbestos, file an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Kaiser Gypsum Company, Inc.

Kaiser Gypsum Company is a former manufacturer of building products, including drywall, joint compounds and cements. The company was the brainchild of Henry J. Kaiser, the influential California businessman whose ventures included Kaiser Aluminum, Kaiser Steel, Kaiser Motors, shipbuilding enterprises and the health care company that would become known as Kaiser-Permanente.
Born in New York State in 1882, Kaiser was a man of big ideas who saw great potential, especially in the post-World War II era. He first went into business in 1923 with a sand and gravel plant; in 1938, he expanded with a cement company. The following year, Kaiser went into the shipbuilding business, filling lucrative ship orders for the U.S. government. During the war, Kaiser’s seven shipyards produced one "Liberty Ship" per day, more than 800 in all. 
Kaiser was known as a master of “vertical integration,” and often founded new companies to work in tandem with other projects he had started. For example, Kaiser founded Kaiser Aluminum to provide metal for his automotive manufacturing company. He was also savvy about the needs of the burgeoning post-war industry. During the war, Kaiser had constructed large housing projects adjacent to his shipyards. In the process, he learned that shortages were a serious problem in the housing industry; plaster, wallboard and other supplies were very hard to come by. As a result, he founded Kaiser Gypsum Company in 1952.
Kaiser retired in 1959, and shortly thereafter his companies began to be sold off – including Kaiser Gypsum, which was sold in 1978 for $35 million to a Canadian company named Domtar. The company was later sold again in 1996 to Georgia Pacific – another company that would eventually come under scrutiny for its use of asbestos.
Asbestos Exposure Risk at Kaiser Gypsum 
Joint compound, sometimes referred to as “mud,” is a spreadable product used in building projects to cover the gaps between adjoining pieces of drywall. The substance, which can be sold in powder form or pre-mixed, is spread over the cracks between two pieces of drywall, allowed to dry, and then sanded down to create a smooth, even wall surface. For many years, companies – including Kaiser Gypsum – added a naturally occurring mineral called asbestos to joint compounds. The mineral helped to make the product resistant to fire, moisture and insects, and also helped make it smoother and more spreadable without changing the product’s basic nature.
It wasn’t just joint compounds that contained asbestos. Numerous companies used asbestos in thousands of products – everything from oven mitts to boilers to packing materials – to make them stronger, more durable or heat- and fire-resistant. The additive was appealing, not just because it was so effective, but because it was readily available in nature and inexpensive.
Today, of course, we know that asbestos is not safe. When products made with asbestos age, or when they are cut or sanded, the thin, fibrous crystals that comprise the mineral are released into the air. This is precisely what occurs when joint compounds, such as those made by Kaiser Gypsum, are mixed, sanded, or when walls that are covered in the compound are demolished. When these fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in a person’s lungs and cause devastating health problems like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis.
The public, for the most part, remained unaware of the health risks associated with asbestos until the mid-1970s, but some say executives at Kaiser Gypsum knew the dangers much earlier. One lawsuit against the company alleged that Kaiser Gypsum knew of the risks at least by 1965, and possible as early as the company’s founding in 1952. 
Kaiser Gypsum products that may have contained asbestos include (but are not limited to):

Kaiser Gypsum Dual Purpose Joint Compound 
Kaiser Gypsum Joint Compound (1953 – 1975) 
Kaiser Gypsum One-Day Joint Compound (1953 – 1975) 













$32 Billion Available in Asbestos Trusts for Mesothelioma Victims
To help cover medical costs and provide financial security.




Occupations at Risk for Asbestos Exposure
Exposure to asbestos in Kaiser Gypsum products could have occurred in any number of sites, both in and out of the workplace. Individuals who worked on construction sites where the company’s asbestos-containing joint compounds were used are one group that could be at risk. This could include drywall tapers, construction workers, supervisors, masons, hod carriers – any type of worker that was on a job site when joint compounds were being mixed or sanded.
Factory workers who worked in Kaiser Gypsum plants could also be at risk of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers if they handled or worked near bags of raw asbestos fibers. Truck drivers and hardware store employees could also have been affected if some asbestos particles escaped while they were handling bags of the product in transit. Demolition workers could also be at risk – even if they worked after the company stopped using asbestos in its products. In fact, many older buildings today probably still contain hazardous Kaiser Gypsum products, so demolition crews should always exercise caution when working on older sites.
Furthermore, anyone who used Kaiser Gypsum’s joint compounds in a home repair project could be at risk – and so could their families. Even if a worker’s loved ones never came into contact with an asbestos product directly, damage may still be done secondhand, if the hazardous asbestos dust is brought home on a worker’s clothes or shoes.

History
Kaiser Aluminum, an aluminum refining and product manufacturing company, was founded by Henry J. Kaiser in 1946. Starting up from two reduction facilities and an aluminum rolling mill, Kaiser Aluminum expanded to include mining and manufacturing processes and the distribution of aluminum, a system known as vertical integration.
As part of its integration model, Kaiser Aluminum acquired bauxite mines and set up refineries where the mined bauxite was transformed into alumina, which was crafted into aluminum and used to fabricate aluminum products. Because asbestos is resistant to high temperatures, the company used it to line vessels exposed to extreme heat during the refining process.
During the 1950s, Kaiser produced asbestos-containing materials for the construction industry and the military. Most notably, it produced asbestos fireboard for U.S. Navy ships.
In recent years, Kaiser Aluminum's basic structure and direction have undergone revisions. As a result, the company stopped its bauxite and alumina operations and has focused on producing high-grade aluminum product manufacturing such as aluminum components for the aerospace industry.
Kaiser Aluminum now owns 12 fabricating plants throughout the United States and Canada, and yields 400 to 500 million pounds of aluminum annually. In 2005, the company reported revenues of $1.1 billion and employed more than 2,000 people.

Compensation for Mesothelioma Victims




Litigation & Specific Lawsuits
Kaiser Aluminum and its subsidiaries manufactured asbestos-containing products from the 1950s to the late 1970s. Many military veterans, mechanics, factory workers, tradesmen and consumers exposed to these products developed severe diseases such as mesothelioma and asbestosis. As a result, by 2001 the company faced more than 100,000 asbestos-related claims.
To handle the financial strain, Kaiser filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002. When the company emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, the Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation Asbestos Personal Injury Trust was established. The trust was formed to process, liquidate and pay all valid asbestos personal injury claims for which Kaiser has legal responsibility. As of 2008, the trust has paid $116 million in claims.
Kaiser was among several companies that paid settlements to Henry and Geraldine Barabin following their 2007 mesothelioma lawsuit. Henry Barabin developed mesothelioma following years of work for a refinery and paper mill. In the lawsuit, Barabin said he was exposed to both amphibole asbestos (from insulation) and chrysotile asbestos (from working around dryer felts). Kaiser was one of at least 17 companies that settled the case, and Kaiser agreed to a payout of $39,675. Barabin died in March 2012.
Industry & Occupations
Kaiser exposed workers to asbestos because it used asbestos during refining and fabricating operations until the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified asbestos as a carcinogen and issued a code of regulations restricting its use in the late 1970s.
During the process of refining alumina from bauxite, the materials must be heated to considerable temperatures, and the reduction vessels need an insulating agent to coat the external walls and isolate the heat. Asbestos, with its heat- and fire-retardant qualities and its low cost and durability, was an ideal choice for containing the heat involved in the reduction processes and for preventing overheating.
Through a variety of heat resistance and electricity isolation applications, asbestos also found its way into the actual fabrication of aluminum products manufactured for the aerospace and automotive industries. The use of asbestos in aluminum production and fabrication affected workers in other industries as well.
Products
A number of Kaiser subsidiaries produced asbestos products for the shipbuilding, construction and air and space industries. Kaiser’s products are also used by the military.
Some Kaiser brand asbestos-containing products include:

K-N Plastic Chrome Ore
Vee Block Castable Insulation
Plastic Insulation Cement
Blast Furnace Castable Insulating Cement
KR 1202/1204 M/C Brick – Metal Encased Firebrick
Coelex 60 Unitab Brick
M-Block Insulation
Super D Block Insulation (made up of 6 percent amosite)
Hard Top Finishing Cement – Mud

Kaiser manufactured these products until the late 1970s.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Asbestos Exposure









Many American workers, across a variety of industries, were exposed to asbestos on the job. As a result, they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma.
In this section, learn about the history of asbestos use, about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them.  Find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure.  Learn which job sites across the United States were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos.
What is Asbestos?

Long considered a miracle material, asbestos boasts excellent fire- and heat- resistant properties. This naturally-occurring mineral, now known to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), has a history that dates back to ancient Greece. Asbestos was used as a building material, even as far back as during the Roman Empire. Asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles.
During the Industrial Revolution, asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the United States. Asbestos was used not only in factories, but also in oil refineries, chemical plants, on railroad cars, and in shipyards. Asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives, to line tanks and ovens in refineries, and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships, from engine rooms to galleys. As the twentieth century progressed, more uses for asbestos were found. It was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles, insulated America’s new skyscrapers, and was used extensively in the construction industry, where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds, cements, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, siding, stucco, plaster, and much more. Those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestos-heavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products.
By the middle of the twentieth century, it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems. Asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma. This asbestos-related cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium. This thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity. Asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface. This scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop.
Despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos, historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous, yet continued to allow its use. Over time, as stories of sick employees became commonplace, the American government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos.

Asbestos Exposure in the United States

Exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites, in shipyards, aboard navy vessels, and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings. People working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk. In addition, teachers, students, and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products, such as ceiling or floor tiles. Equally at risk are families of these workers, as asbestos often was carried home on clothing.

If you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used, you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma.

Different Types of Asbestos Exposure

Military Exposure
Asbestos was used across all branches of the military for  many years. Navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving  on ships (aircraft  carriers, destroyers, submarines, battleships, warships,  etc.) in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country. Army  veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and  while working on military vehicles. Air Force veterans were exposed while  working with military aircraft. Marine Corps veterans that spent time at sea  aboard Navy ships were exposed to asbestos. All veterans exposed to asbestos  have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial and Industrial Exposure
Many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and  commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer.  The types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries, power  plants, steel  mills and chemical plants to name a few. They all have “high heat”  environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required,  be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective  clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas (i.e.  fire-proof gloves and aprons). Today, even though the use of asbestos has been  banned in the United States, many existing industrial and commercial structures  may still contain a certain level of asbestos. It is important that appropriate  safety precautions be taken, where necessary, to prevent harmful exposure and  to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial Product Exposure
Do-it-yourself home renovation enthusiasts, as well as those  who worked in the construction trade, may have been exposed to asbestos while  working with popular building and construction products. Many of these products  were made with asbestos through the late 1970’s as the projects they were to be  used in required that they be heat and fire resistant. They included insulation,  roofing material, siding, joint  compound, ceiling tiles, flooring and more. Unfortunately when any of these  products were cut, sawed filed, or sanded, asbestos fibers were released into  the air. In the majority of cases, those working with the products did not use  appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information  about the health hazards of asbestos for many years. Today, as a result,  construction workers and do-it-yourselfers are at risk for developing  mesothelioma or other asbestos-related  diseases.
Second Hand Exposure
Direct, on-the-job asbestos exposure did not affect American  workers alone. Their family members were also at risk of developing an  asbestos-related disease as a result of second  hand asbestos exposure. This type of exposure occurred when workers brought  asbestos fibers home on their hair, clothing or shoes at the end of the work  day. Those responsible for laundering their work clothes, day in and day out,  were most commonly affected, but even small children who spent time with their parent  before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at  risk of developing an asbestos-related illness.
Talc Exposure
Talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries. Talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe, but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits. Due to this, some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos. While talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure, some consumer products, namely baby powder and, more recently, children’s art supplies, have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users, mostly women, to be exposed to asbestos. Today, products using talc are tested for asbestos, but that was not always the case. Because mesothelioma has a long latency period, miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestos-containing talc products.

Unions Protect Workers from Asbestos Exposure

 Throughout the United States and across the world, hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries, from steel workers to plumbers, to electricians.  Unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job. Unions have organized witnesses for court cases, have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma, and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by mega-companies to compensate asbestos victims.

Compensation for Workers Exposed to Asbestos

If you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure, you may be entitled to compensation.  Each state has its own deadlines, called statutes of limitations, which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits.

100 Years of Innovation. 100 Years of Kaiser.


A book about our history 
When marking our milestone birthday in 2013, our first aim was to take advantage of this opportunity for a more in-depth look at our past and also to document it. This was the context which gave rise to the idea of the book. As a result of our collaboration with the author and historian Veronika Marxer as part of our team in Schaanwald over an 18-month period, a work has been created which vividly tells the story of how the company developed from a small workshop operation to become an international industrial enterprise.
