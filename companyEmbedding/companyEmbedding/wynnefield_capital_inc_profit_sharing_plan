This Amendment No.
7 (the "Amendment") amends and supplements the Items set forth below of the Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Schedule
13D, originally filed by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons (as defined in the Schedule 13D) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “Commission”) on October 15, 2013, as further amended by Amendment No. 1 filed on January 24, 2014, as further
amended by Amendment No. 2 filed on March 13, 2014, further amended by Amendment No. 3 filed on March 28, 2014, as further amended
by Amendment No. 4 filed on November 18, 2014, as further amended by Amendment No. 5 filed on February 25, 2015 and as further
amended by Amendment No. 6 filed on April 16, 2015 (collectively, the “Schedule 13D”) with respect to shares of common
stock (the “Common Stock”), $0.0001 par value per share of GlyEco, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Issuer”)
with its principal executive offices located at 4802 East Ray Road, Suite 23-196, Phoenix, Arizona 85044. Unless specifically amended
hereby, the disclosures set forth in the Schedule 13D shall remain unchanged. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall
have the meaning set forth in the Schedule 13D.
 
Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or
Other Consideration.
 
Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended
and restated by the addition of the following:
 
The
securities reported in this Schedule 13D as directly beneficially owned by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons were acquired
with funds of approximately $7,276,786 (including brokerage commissions). All such funds were provided from the working
capital or personal funds of the Wynnefield Reporting Persons who directly beneficially own such securities.
 
Item 4. Purpose of the Transaction
 
Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated
by the addition of the following:
 
On February 26, 2016,
the Issuer closed a subscription rights offering. Pursuant to the subscription rights offering, the Issuer distributed to holders
of its Common Stock non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to 50,200,947 shares of Common Stock. Each shareholder
received one subscription right for every one share of Common Stock owned at 5:00 p.m. EST on October 30, 2015, the record date.
Each subscription right entitled a shareholder to purchase 0.7 shares of Common Stock at a subscription price of $0.08 per share,
which was referred to as the basic subscription privilege. During the subscription rights offering, subscription rights to purchase
a total of 37,475,620 shares of Common Stock were exercised. The Wynnefield Reporting Persons purchased 18,750,000 shares of Common
Stock during the subscription rights offering for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000.
 
Other than as set forth
in this Item 4, the Wynnefield Reporting Persons do not have any current plans, proposals or negotiations that relate to or would
result in any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. The Wynnefield Reporting Persons
intend to review their investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis, and to the extent permitted by law, may seek to engage in
discussions with other stockholders and/or with management and the Board of the Issuer concerning the business, operations or future
plans of the Issuer. Depending on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuer’s financial position, the price
levels of the shares of Common Stock, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions, the Wynnefield
Reporting Persons may, in the future take such actions with respect to their investment in the Issuer as they deem appropriate
including, without limitation, purchasing additional shares of Common Stock, selling shares of Common Stock, engaging in short
selling of or any hedging or similar transaction with respect to the Common Stock, taking any other action with respect to the
Issuer or any of its securities in any manner permitted by law or changing its intention with respect to any and all matters referred
to in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4.

approximately 26.79% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The percentage of shares of Common Stock reported as being beneficially
owned by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons is based upon 110,045,324 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of February 26, 2016
as set forth in the Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on March 3, 2016.
 
The following table
sets forth certain information with respect to Common Stock directly beneficially owned by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons listed

WCM is the sole general
partner of Wynnefield Partners and Wynnefield Partners I and, accordingly, may be deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner (as
that term is defined under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the Common Stock that Wynnefield Partners and Wynnefield Partners
I beneficially own. WCM, as the sole general partner of Wynnefield Partners and Wynnefield Partners I, has the sole power to direct
the voting and disposition of the Common Stock that Wynnefield Partners and Wynnefield Partners I beneficially own. Messrs. Obus
and Landes are the co-managing members of WCM and, accordingly, each of Messrs. Obus and Landes may be deemed to be the indirect
beneficial owner (as that term is defined under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the Common Stock that WCM may be deemed to
beneficially own. Each of Messrs. Obus and Landes, as co-managing members of WCM, share the power to direct the voting and disposition
of the shares of Common Stock that WCM may be deemed to beneficially own.
 
WCI is the sole investment
manager of Wynnefield Offshore and, accordingly, may be deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner (as that term is defined under
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the Common Stock that Wynnefield Offshore beneficially owns. WCI, as the sole investment
manager of Wynnefield Offshore, has the sole power to direct the voting and disposition of the Common Stock that Wynnefield Offshore
beneficially owns. Messrs. Obus and Landes are executive officers of WCI and, accordingly, each may be deemed to be the indirect

The Plan is an employee
profit sharing plan. Messrs. Obus and Landes are the co-trustees of the Plan and accordingly, Messrs. Obus and Landes may be deemed
to be the indirect beneficial owner (as that term is defined under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the shares of Common Stock
that the Plan may be deemed to beneficially own. Each of Messrs. Obus and Landes, as the trustees of the Plan, shares with the
other the power to direct the voting and disposition of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Plan.
 
Beneficial ownership
of the Common Stock shown on the cover pages of and set forth elsewhere in this Schedule 13D for each member of the Wynnefield
Reporting Persons assumes that they have not formed a group for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) under the Exchange Act, and Rule 13d-5(b)(1)
promulgated thereunder. If the members of the Wynnefield Reporting Persons were deemed to have formed a group for purposes of Section
13(d)(3) and Rule 13d-5(b)(1), the group would be deemed to own beneficially (and may be deemed to have shared voting and dispositive
power over) 29,485,247 shares of Common Stock, constituting approximately 26.79% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The
percentage of Common Stock reported as beneficially owned by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons is based upon 110,045,324 shares
of Common Stock outstanding as of February 26, 2016 as set forth in the Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Commission on March 3, 2016.
 
The filing of this
Schedule 13D and any future amendment by the Wynnefield Reporting Persons, and the inclusion of information herein and therein
with respect to WCM, WCI and Messrs. Obus and Landes, shall not be considered an admission that any of such persons, for the purpose
of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, are the beneficial owners of any shares in which such persons do not have a pecuniary interest.
Each of WCM, WCI and Messrs. Obus and Landes disclaims any beneficial ownership of the shares covered by this Schedule 13D.

Persons have acquired shares of Common Stock during the last 60 days, as follows:
