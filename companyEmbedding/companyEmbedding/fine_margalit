Executive VP, API Company: Albany Molecular Research Inc.http://www.amriglobal.com/ 

‘5 minutes with Margalit Fine, Executive VP, API at AMRI'
1. What are the key global trends at the moment that are driving the pharmaceutical sector you are working in? How does your company respond to those trends?
Essentially, industry consolidation is triggering interest in larger outsourcing partners with more services and more products. We are entering a new growth era as outsourcing trends increase. As our pharmaceutical customers grow and merge, they are looking to consolidate their vendors and work with larger CMOs and they also desire to work with fewer CMOs that they will need to visit, maintain relationships with and perform quality audits on. The global pharmaceutical industry us simplifying to core competencies and this means that they are reducing their internal resources and reducing fixed cost structures.
2. What are the top challenges faced by the pharmaceutical sector you represent at this moment? How does your company deal with these challenges and how do you anticipate in your role?
We understand customer needs within the pharmaceutical sector as we build a preeminent CRO/CDMO for complex science. AMRI offers a powerful global network of that has the necessary capacity and breadth of innovative services that our customers deserve for their projects across the entire drug pathway continuum – from target discovery through to NDA/ANDA development and approval.
3. What is the main highlight of the product/service you are introducing within Exhibitor Showcase? Who is your presentation aimed at?
Building a premier supplier of contract research, development and manufacturing services organization requires an understanding of the marketplace, a long-term strategy for inorganic and organic growth and the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions. AMRI’s July 2016 acquisition of Prime European Therapeuticals S.p.A., also known as “Euticals”, positions AMRI as one of the largest independent developers and suppliers of API to the pharmaceutical industry and provides the company with an established custom synthesis presence in key European markets.
As AMRI celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, this transaction is a timely achievement that positions AMRI for success over many years to come. Euticals is a privately-held company headquartered in Lodi, Italy, specializing in custom synthesis and the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The acquisition more than doubles AMRI’s contract revenue; significantly expands our portfolio of niche, high barrier to entry APIs; expands our global footprint; expands and diversifies our customer base; and affords customers new/expanded capabilities and technologies.
4. Why do you think it is important for pharmaceutical professionals to attend the presentation of your company?
The new AMRI is well-equipped to offer both AMRI’s and Euticals’ customers a broader suite of capabilities across the drug discovery, development and manufacturing spectrum.
This acquisition significantly enhances AMRI’s global footprint; we will extend our innovative products and services into new markets, bringing the offerings our customers demand even closer. AMRI now has a greatly expanded portfolio of market-leading APIs and world-class capabilities in niche and high barrier to entry technologies. Specifically, we will now be able to offer:
An extensive API portfolio, including over 85 filed U.S. DMFs and 17 granted EU COS/CEPs
Sterile and high potency API, steroids, monobactams, boronic acids and controlled substances
U.S. and European-based chemical development expertise for your early stage compounds
U.S. and European-based custom synthesis and contract manufacturing expertise
Extensive technology expertise in specialty areas such as hydrogenation, fermentation, photocatalytic chemistry, bio transformation, industrial chromatography, flow chemistry and spray drying
A broad spectrum of analytical research and testing services, including solid state chemistry and container closure integrity testing
Additional opportunity to vertically integrate customer projects with our Discovery Services and Drug Product businesses
 
5. What are the main strengths of your company and why should pharmaceutical clients within your sector choose for working with you?
Our customers choose us because they want to work with a premier provider of global discovery, development and manufacturing services for the pharmaceutical industry that has a robust global footprint; a strong reputation for quality; a focus on complex, high-barrier-to-entry products; and innovative services, all under one roof. With fewer CMOs with an established quality record, working with AMRI affords our customers a significant competitive advantage in the European and U.S. markets, as we provide them with world-class, integrated drug discovery centers with leading-edge technology platforms and scientific expertise; innovative services across the entire drug pathway continuum via strategic partnerships and acquisitions; and seamless project transition – from early discovery through commercial supply.

Big and broad, a very stylish win, picked from a single vineyard,  with fine concentration and structure that when opened and poured in the glass reveals an array of currant, blackberry and black licorice on a background of near-sweet tannins.  Elegant and on the long finish, with a hint of raspberries.
93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot
Appellation: Shomron
