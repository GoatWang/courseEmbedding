REITs Overview
 Real estate is one of the oldest means by which individuals have accumulated and measured their wealth. In fact, there was once a time when real estate was considered the more "traditional" investment while stocks and bonds were thought of as “alternatives.” Today there are a number of ways to invest in real estate, and one that has grown exponentially in popularity is the non-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT.
REITs are specialized investments that pool the money of many investors to purchase real estate assets, primarily properties. REITs can focus on one property type, such as office, or include many different kinds of properties in a single portfolio. REITs can also vary in terms of their geographic focus—they can be regional, national or global in scope.
An investor’s return from a REIT investment may come from different sources depending on the REIT’s strategy. Typically, income from rents, minus expenses, is passed through to the REIT and, after paying other expenses of the REIT, is then distributed to shareholders. The REIT may also seek to grow the value of invested capital, providing additional return to investors in the event of a future liquidity event, such as a listing on an exchange, merger, or sale of REIT assets.
Remember that, like real estate, an investment in a non-traded REIT does not offer ready liquidity like you would find with stocks and bonds. Distributions from a REIT are not guaranteed, nor is growth in the value of invested capital. Future liquidity events are also not guaranteed. An investment in a non-traded REIT is subject to significant upfront and ongoing expenses which can reduce the amount available for an investment and reduce an investor's overall return.

Overview
 NOTE:  Hines Global REIT closed to new investors on April 11, 2014.



Hines Global REIT: Your passport to global real estate.® 



Hines Global REIT owns and manages a diversified real estate portfolio that includes office, multifamily, retail, industrial and other real estate investments in domestic and international markets. It was launched in August 2009 and has a portfolio of investments in 18 locations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Australia.3

Portfolio Summary4

Estimated aggregate value: $4.8 billionNumber of investments: 40 projects, 16.0 million square feetPercentage leased: 93%


16.5% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.03 per share estimated NAV and assumes the daily distribution rate ($0.0017808 per share, per day) declared since January 2015 is maintained for one year.2Our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with cash flows from financing activities, which may include proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from our debt financings. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we paid $1.1 million and $22.0 million in acquisition fees and expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses were expensed and therefore reduced cash flows from operating activities. However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.3Data as of March 31, 2017.4Assumes 100% ownership in each of Hines Global REIT’s real estate assets and investments in real estate-related debt. We own less than 100% of the interests in three projects. Assuming the REIT’s effective ownership, the estimated aggregate value would be $4.8 billion; square feet would be 16.0 million and the percentage leased would be 93%.5Please see Hines Global REIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017 for a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, as well as the limitations of the estimated per share NAV. The estimated per share NAV was calculated as of a moment in time, and, although the value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, developments related to individual assets, purchases and sales of additional assets and the payment of fees and closing costs in connection therewith, changes in the real estate and capital markets, the distribution of sales proceeds to Hines Global REIT’s stockholders (if any) and changes in corporate policies such as Hines Global REIT’s distribution level relative to earnings, Hines Global REIT does not undertake to update the estimated per share NAV on a regular basis. As a result, stockholders should not rely on the estimated per share NAV as an accurate measure of the then-current value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock in making a decision to buy or sell shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock, including whether to reinvest distributions by participating in Hines Global REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan and whether to request redemption under Hines Global REIT’s share redemption program. The estimated per share NAV is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize an amount equal to the estimated per share NAV if such stockholder attempts to sell the his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated per share NAV upon Hines Global REIT’s liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock would trade at the estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; or (iv) a third party would offer the estimated per share NAV in an arm’s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of Hines Global REIT’s shares of common stock.

Investing Worldwide for Income and Growth®Looking for a product that can complement your traditional investment mix while adding the potential for income and growth to your portfolio? Tap into the diversity of real estate markets worldwide with Hines Global REIT II, a public non-traded REIT that is sponsored by Hines, one of the largest, privately owned global real estate firms in the world.1
 Hear more from some of the executives behind Hines Global REIT II.
 
Hines Global REIT II's Strategy and Objectives:2

Hines Global REIT II, Inc. ("Hines Global REIT II") intends to invest in a diversified real estate portfolio2 in markets around the world to achieve attractive total returns upon the sale of investments or other liquidity event3
Preserve shareholders’ invested capital and provide modest growth in the value of invested capital
Provide income in the form of regular, stable cash distributions4
Has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2015

1Hines is the sponsor of Hines Global REIT II. Investors are not acquiring an interest in Hines.2Hines Global REIT II may not achieve any of its objectives.3The Hines Global REIT II board of directors has the sole discretion to consider a liquidity event at any time if it determines such event to be in Hines Global REIT II’s best interests. A liquidity event is not guaranteed and may be postponed.4Hines Global REIT II has not generated sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid and distributions have exceeded earnings. Therefore, some or all of Hines Global REIT II's distributions have been paid and may continue to be paid from other sources, such as proceeds from debt financings, proceeds from the public offering, cash advances by Hines Global REIT II Advisors LP (the "Advisor"), cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees and/or proceeds from the sale of assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Hines Global REIT II funded 100% of total distributions with cash flows from financing activities, which includes offering proceeds. In order to more closely align the amount of distributions paid with operations, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2014, the Advisor agreed to waive the asset management fees for each quarter through December 31, 2016, to the extent that Hines Global REIT II’s modified funds from operations ("MFFO") for a particular quarter, as disclosed in its Quarterly or Annual Report, as applicable, amounts to less than the aggregate distributions declared to its stockholders for such quarter. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Advisor agreed to waive asset management fees to the extent that Hines Global REIT II's MFFO for such quarter as reduced to reflect the payment of the distribution and stockholder servicing fee, as disclosed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, amounts to less than 100% of the aggregate distributions declared to its stockholders for that quarter. As a result of these waivers, the Advisor waived $1.9 million in asset management fees payable to it since inception through March 31, 2017. There can be no assurances that the Advisor will continue these waivers in future periods. Hines Global REIT II has not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. The use of sources other than cash flows from operations to fund distributions could lower returns and the payment of distributions from offering proceeds constitutes a return of principal. If the Advisor had not waived fees, distributions would have been paid from an investor’s paid-in capital, which lowers returns. The availability and timing of distributions Hines Global REIT II may pay is uncertain and cannot be assured. The Hines Global REIT II board of directors may also amend or terminate the distribution reinvestment plan for any reason upon 10 days' prior notice. 
55.67% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.64 per share offering price and assumes the daily distribution rate ($0.001653699 per share, per day) declared beginning April 2017 is maintained for one year. For the period commencing on May 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, the approximate annualized distribution rate was 5.47%, based on the current offering price per Class A Share and the daily distribution rate of $0.001594766 per share, per day that was declared for that period. The actual annualized distribution rate for a particular shareholder will vary based on the per share offering price paid. 6The share prices are at the maximum sales charge and include up-front selling commissions, fees and/or expenses, which reduce the amount available for investment. The share prices were determined by the Hines Global REIT II board of directors in its sole discretion, do not represent the current value of the properties in the portfolio, and may be higher or lower than the value of the properties in the portfolio at any given time. 75.00% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.06 per share offering price and assumes the daily distribution rate declared beginning April 2017 is maintained for one year. Distributions for Class T Shares will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to $0.001653699 per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable with respect to Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). For the period commencing on May 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, the approximate annualized distribution rate was 4.79%, based on the current offering price per Class T Share and the daily distribution rate of $0.001594766 per share, per day (less distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable with respect to such Class T Shares (as calculated on a daily basis)) that was declared for that period. The actual annualized distribution rate for a particular shareholder will vary based on the per share offering price paid and the total amount of distribution and stockholder fees payable. 85.95% annualized distribution rate is based on the $9.73 per share offering price and assumes the daily distribution rate declared beginning May 2017 is maintained for one year. Distributions for Class I Shares will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day in an amount equal to $0.001653699 per share, per day less the distribution and stockholder servicing fees payable with respect to Class I Shares (as calculated on a daily basis). The actual distribution rate for Class I Shares will vary based on the total amount of distribution and stockholder fees payable.

HMS Income Fund
  



HMS Income Fund: Created With You andAmerican Businesses in Mind.
Public offering expected to close to new investors on or about September 30, 2017.
HMS Income Fund is a public, non-traded business development company (BDC) that focuses on income and capital appreciation. The company’s strategy is to make debt investments in syndicated middle-market companies as well as self-originated debt and equity investments in lower middle-market companies.
HMS Income Fund taps the experience and resources of Main Street Capital Corporation (“Main Street”), a publicly-traded BDC (NYSE: MAIN), through MSC Adviser I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is the sub-adviser to the fund. The sub-adviser recommends and monitors all of HMS Income Fund’s investments, targeting investment opportunities that arise from ownership transitions, strategic acquisitions, business expansions and other growth initiatives, primarily for later stage businesses. Since its inception, Main Street has specialized in providing long-term loans and equity capital to middle-market and lower middle-market U.S. companies.
There are substantial costs associated with an investment in this offering. An investor must review the fees and expenses in the prospectus prior to investing.
Click here for information on sales charges, fees and expenses.
Please note: Investors are not acquiring an interest in Main Street.1There is no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 
2Price effective as of the Company's January 19, 2017 weekly closing. Based upon the calculated NAV, the pricing committee reviews the offering price to ensure that shares are not being offered at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, below NAV per share. Periodic valuations will cause offering price to fluctuate.

Hines Global REIT II Acquires Prime Retail in Cincinnati


January 9, 2017




(CINCINNATI) – Hines, the international real estate firm, announced today that Hines Global REIT II, Inc. has acquired Rookwood Pavilion and Rookwood Commons, two contiguous shopping centers that operate as a single property referred to as Rookwood, located in the Midtown submarket of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Rookwood consists of 600,071 square feet of gross leasable area that is 97 percent leased to 73 leading retailers and restaurants, including Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack, T.J. Maxx, Joseph-Beth Booksellers, P.F. Chang’s, and J. Alexander’s. Known as a unique, high-end open-air lifestyle center, Rookwood serves a densely populated, urban trade area from its strategic location approximately five miles northeast of Cincinnati’s dynamic central business district.

  
Sherri Schugart, president and CEO of Hines Global REIT II, said, “We were attracted to Rookwood because it contains an outstanding collection of retailers in an affluent, urban trade area with high barriers to entry. The center serves shoppers from all over Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, including over 50,000 students at neighboring University of Cincinnati and Xavier University.”

  
Hines Vice President/Property Management Dan Eifert noted, “Rookwood is conveniently located in close proximity to some of Cincinnati’s most attractive and affluent neighborhoods, including Hyde Park, Oakley, Columbia-Tusculum and Mount Lookout. These neighborhoods have enjoyed rapid appreciation over the past five years, command some of the highest home values in Cincinnati, and have residents with some of the area’s highest income levels, all of which have contributed to Rookwood’s success.”

  
This acquisition represents Hines Global REIT II’s sixth purchase and is the first retail property in its portfolio. Eastdil Secured represented the seller in the transaction.

  
Hines Global REIT II is a public, non-listed real estate investment trust sponsored by Hines. It commenced operations in 2014 and invests in commercial real estate investments located in the United States and internationally.

Exhibit
10.2
 
COST REIMBURSEMENT
AGREEMENT
 
This
Cost Reimbursement Agreement (this “Agreement”) dated
as of the 8 th
day
of December, 2016 and effective as of January 1, 2017 (the
“Effective Date”), is made by and among each of Hines
Global REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the
“Company”), Hines Securities, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “ Dealer
Manager”), Hines Global REIT II Advisors LP, a Texas limited
partnership (the “Advisor”), (collectively, the
“Issuer Entities”) and American Enterprise Investment
Services Inc. (“AEIS”).
 
WHEREAS,
the Issuer Entities and Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc.
(“Ameriprise”) have entered into a Selected Dealer
Agreement dated December 31, 2014, as amended by the Amendment to
Selected Dealer Agreement dated February 27, 2015, Amendment No. 2
to Selected Dealer Agreement dated September 3, 2015, Amendment No.
3 to Selected Dealer Agreement, effective as of April 11, 2016, and
Amendment No. 4 to the Selected Dealer Agreement dated as of
December 8, 2016 and effective as of January 1, 2017 (the
“Selected Dealer Agreement”) that sets forth the
understandings and agreements whereby Ameriprise will offer and
sell, on a best efforts basis, for the account of the Company,
shares (“Shares”) of common stock (the “Common
Stock”) of the Company registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement and Prospectus filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as the same may be amended or supplemented
from time to time (the “Offering Documents”);
and
 
WHEREAS,
prior to the Effective Date, (i) pursuant to Section 3(d) of the
Selected Dealer Agreement (a) the Dealer Manager re-allows to
Ameriprise a marketing fee (the “Marketing Fee”) and
(b) the Advisor pays or causes to be paid to Ameriprise the amount
of any bona fide, itemized, separately invoiced due diligence
expenses (the “Due Diligence Expenses”), (ii) pursuant
to Section 6(a)(viii) of the Selected Dealer Agreement, the Dealer

expenses related to such technology costs, and the facilitation of
the marketing of the Shares and the ownership of such Shares by
Ameriprise’s customers, including fees to attend
Company-sponsored conferences (the “Distribution
Expenses”), and (iii) pursuant to Section 6(b) of the
Selected Dealer Agreement ,
the
Company may reimburse Ameriprise to the extent that
Ameriprise’s compliance with an Ad Hoc Request (as defined in
Section 6(b) of the Selected Dealer Agreement) would cause
Ameriprise to incur additional material expenses, in which case the
Company and Ameriprise will mutually agree as to the payment of
such expenses between the parties (the “Ad Hoc Request
Expenses” and, collectively with the Marketing Fee, the Due
Diligence Expenses, and the Distribution Expenses, the “Cost
Reimbursement Compensation”); and
 
WHEREAS,
AEIS, an SEC registered broker-dealer and Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member (CRD # 26506), is
an affiliate of Ameriprise and currently provides clearing and
related services solely and exclusively for Ameriprise;
and
 
WHEREAS,
the Dealer Manager and AEIS are parties to that certain Alternative
Investment Product Networking Services Agreement, dated March 23,
2012 as amended (the “AIP Networking Agreement”),
pursuant to which the broker-controlled accounts of
Ameriprise’s customers that invest in the Company will be
processed and serviced; and
 
WHEREAS,
Ameriprise intends to migrate its cost
reimbursement-related operations to AEIS as of the Effective
Date , and thereafter AEIS shall
provide such services to Ameriprise financial advisors affiliated
with Ameriprise.
 
NOW,
THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Issuer Entities
and AEIS agree as follows:
 

 


 




 


1.    Cost
Reimbursement Services

 

As
of the Effective Date and continuing thereafter, AEIS will perform,
for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company who are clients
of Ameriprise, certain broker-dealer services including, but not
limited to, distribution, marketing, administration and stockholder
servicing support (the “Cost Reimbursement Services”),
which were previously performed by Ameriprise under the Selected
Dealer Agreement. Cost Reimbursement Services performed by AEIS
will further include product due
diligence, training and education, and other support-related
functions. These Cost Reimbursement Services will be performed at
AEIS by associated persons of AEIS.

 

2.    Payment
Amounts

 

As
of the Effective Date and continuing thereafter, in consideration
of the Cost Reimbursement Services to be provided by AEIS, (i) the
Marketing Fee shall be re-allowed directly to AEIS by the Dealer
Manager, (ii) the amount of any Due Diligence Expenses shall be
paid by the Advisor directly to or on behalf of AEIS (as directed
by AEIS), (iii) the Dealer Manager shall pay or cause to be paid
directly to AEIS the amount of any Distribution Expenses incurred
by AEIS, subject to Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as
mutually agreed upon by the parties to this Agreement, and (iv) the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount
of any Ad Hoc Request Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Issuer Entities and AEIS
specifically acknowledge and agree that the payments described in
clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of this Section 2 shall be remitted
directly to AEIS, and the payment of Due Diligence Expenses in
clause (ii) of this Section 2 shall be remitted directly to or on
behalf of AEIS (as directed by AEIS), in each case separate and
apart from the Selling Commissions (as defined in the Selected
Dealer Agreement) and distribution and stockholder servicing fees
(the “Distribution and Stockholder Servicing Fees”)
payable to Ameriprise under Section 3(d) of the Selected Dealer
Agreement. AEIS acknowledges and agrees that AEIS shall be entitled
to receive only the Marketing Fees and other amounts payable to
AEIS pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and AEIS shall not be
entitled to receive the Selling Commissions and Distribution and
Stockholder Servicing Fees payable to Ameriprise pursuant to the
Selected Dealer Agreement, which shall continue to be remitted
directly to Ameriprise pursuant to the terms of the Selected Dealer
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer Entities
acknowledge and agree that such payment of Cost Reimbursement
Compensation to AEIS shall not be paid as a
‘pass-through’ to Ameriprise for payment to
AEIS.

 

3.    Payment
Process

 

(a)The
Dealer Manager shall re-allow to AEIS out of its dealer manager fee
a Marketing Fee of up to 1.5% of the full price of each
Class A Share (except for Class A Shares sold pursuant to
the DRIP) sold by Ameriprise; provided however , the Dealer
Manager will not pay AEIS a Marketing Fee if the aggregate
underwriting compensation to be paid to all parties in connection
with the Company’s offering made pursuant to the Offering
Documents (the “Offering”) exceeds the limitations
prescribed by FINRA. The
Dealer Manager shall re-allow to AEIS out of its dealer manager fee
a Marketing Fee of up to 2.5% of the full price of each Class T
Share (except for Class T Shares sold pursuant to the DRIP) sold by
Ameriprise; provided however , the Dealer Manager will not
pay AEIS a Marketing Fee if the aggregate underwriting compensation
to be paid to all parties in connection with the Offering exceeds
the limitations prescribed by FINRA.
No
payment of the Marketing Fee will be made in respect of
subscriptions for Shares (or portions thereof) which are rejected
by the Company. The Marketing Fee will be paid via an electronic
wire transfer initiated by the Dealer Manager according to the wire
instructions set forth immediately below on the second business day
following the week in which the dealer manager fee on the
applicable Shares sold by Ameriprise is received by the Dealer
Manager from the Company. The Marketing Fee will be payable only
with respect to transactions lawful in the jurisdictions where they
occur. AEIS affirms that the Dealer Manager’s liability for
the Cost Reimbursement Compensation and any other amount payable
from the Dealer Manager to AEIS is limited solely to the amount of
the dealer manager fees received by the Dealer Manager from the
Company, and AEIS hereby waives any and all

 


 




 


rights
to receive payment of the Marketing Fee and any other amount due to
AEIS until such time as the Dealer Manager has received from the
Company the dealer manager fees from the sale of Shares by
Ameriprise. No Marketing Fees shall be paid to AEIS for purchases
made by an investor pursuant to the Company’s distribution
reinvestment plan.

(b)The
Advisor shall pay or cause to be paid to or on behalf of AEIS (as
directed by AEIS) the amount of any Due Diligence Expenses
consistent with the language in the Offering Documents, applicable
regulations and FINRA rules. The Advisor shall pay or cause to be
paid to or on behalf of AEIS (as directed by AEIS) the amount of
any invoice for such Due Diligence Expenses within two weeks of the
Advisor’s receipt of such invoice.

(c)The
Dealer Manager shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the
amount of any Distribution Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Dealer Manager shall pay or
cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount of any invoice for
such Distribution Expenses within two weeks of the Dealer
Manager’s receipt of such invoice.

(d)The
Company shall pay or cause to be paid directly to AEIS the amount
of any Ad Hoc Request Expenses incurred by AEIS, subject to
Section 3(f) of this Agreement and as mutually agreed upon by
the parties to this Agreement. The Company shall pay or cause to be
paid directly to AEIS the amount of any invoice for such Ad Hoc
Request Expenses within two weeks of the Company’s receipt of
such invoice.

(e)AEIS
will have sole responsibility and AEIS’s records will provide
the sole basis (in each instance with the assistance of Ameriprise)
for calculating the Marketing Fees payable to AEIS under this
Agreement and the amounts of the Due Diligence Expenses, the
Distribution Expenses and the Ad Hoc Request Expenses for which
AEIS shall provide invoices under this Agreement. However, the
Issuer Entities may provide records to assist AEIS in its
calculations.

(f)The
parties acknowledge and agree that the total compensation paid to
Ameriprise and AEIS in connection with the Offering pursuant to the
Selected Dealer Agreement and the Cost Reimbursement Agreement
shall not exceed the limitations prescribed by FINRA, including the
10% limitation prescribed by FINRA Rule 2310 on compensation of
participating broker-dealers, which is calculated with respect to
the gross proceeds from sales of Shares by Ameriprise (except for
Shares sold pursuant to the DRIP). The Company, the Dealer Manager
and AEIS agree to monitor the payment of all fees and expense
reimbursements to assure that FINRA limitations are not exceeded.
Accordingly, if at any time the Company or the Dealer Manager
determines in good faith that any payment to AEIS pursuant to this
Cost Reimbursement Agreement and/or any payment to Ameriprise
pursuant to the Selected Dealer Agreement could result in a
violation of the applicable FINRA regulations, the Company or the
Dealer Manager shall promptly notify AEIS, and the Company, the
Dealer Manager and AEIS agree to cooperate with each other to
implement such measures as they determine are necessary to ensure
continued compliance with applicable FINRA regulations. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Company or the Dealer Manager determines
in good faith that any payment to AEIS pursuant to this Cost
Reimbursement Agreement and/or any payment to Ameriprise pursuant
to the Selected Dealer Agreement could result in a violation of the
applicable FINRA regulations and there is a dispute as to whether
Ameriprise or AEIS will return such payment to the Company or the

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.
