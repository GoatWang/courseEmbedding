Cloud Backup 101
Everything you ever wanted to know about the cloud

























What is cloud backup?





Cloud backup is a technology that involves sending a copy of your data to an offsite vendor – a cloud provider – that keeps the data secure and accessible in real time, usually for a monthly fee.
What's great about the cloud is that it keeps a copy of your files at a safe and secure off-site location so you don't have to worry about losing data if your computer crashes or you accidentally delete a file or photo.
And there isn’t just one cloud. There are many cloud vendors that maintain various data centers. For example, Carbonite stores your files remotely in our own data centers.




140+ petabytes of data
under our protection

That’s the equivalent of backing up more than 33 million songs!

















How is cloud backup different than cloud storage?





Many people confuse backup and storage by thinking they are the same thing. In fact, they are two very different things.
A lot of customers choose cloud storage because it’s often free. Then they learn the hard way that cloud storage does not offer the same protection against data loss that cloud backup does.
Storage solutions like Dropbox, Box and Google Docs offer sync and share services – meaning they provide backup only for the files you have selected to share. Also, it’s possible you won’t receive top-notch encryption policies with these services.
A cloud backup solution like Carbonite can automatically back up all your folders, files and photos continuously. That means every time you open a file, make an edit, and save it on your computer, it’s automatically updated and backed up in the cloud as well. And a cloud backup solution uses advanced encryption at every step to protect the data.




30% of people
have never backed up. †
















How do I backup my computer to the cloud?





When it comes to backing up your computer, you have several options. You can choose from an external hard drive, a web-based storage application, or a cloud backup solution like Carbonite.
Saving exclusively to an external hard drive or thumb drive leaves your data susceptible to accidents and viruses. Why? For starters, external thumb drives can be easily lost and you have to continuously update them.
In addition, they do not protect against viruses or hardware failure. If any of those things happens, any data you haven’t uploaded is lost.
A cloud backup solution does the work for you – automatically and continuously backing up all of your files and folders. It’s the easiest, safest and most secure way to protect your data.




39% of data disasters
are caused by accident†

















Is cloud backup safe?





The short answer is: Yes.
Carbonite takes data protection very seriously. You can rest easy knowing that every file we back up is encrypted before it leaves your computer and remains encrypted while it’s stored at secure datacenters.
What is encryption? Encryption is an advanced method of encoding data so that it is unreadable by people or computers without the encryption key. The encryption that we use — Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) — is the same kind used by the U.S. government and the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect classified information.
In addition to using advanced encryption to hide your data from prying eyes, we also ensure that any datacenters where we store your encrypted data are physically secure. This includes climate-control, backup power generators and armed guards.




We asked people what
things they'd gladly give up
instead of losing their data. Here’s what they said:



Internet connection


Cell service


An internal organ




Wedding ring


Robot lawnmower


Bacon!

















Do I really need it?





Yes. If you’re like most people, you probably have once-in-a-lifetime memories along with important personal files related to your career and home on your computer. 
It’s so easy to lose these things. In fact, it happens all the time through accidental deletions, equipment failures, viruses and natural disasters to name a few. Most people don’t even realize they need cloud backup until it’s too late.
Remember, some disasters can be everyday happenings – like spilling a coffee on your keyboard. Also, more and more threats to your data come from pervasive viruses.
If you want to keep your photos and files safe, you need backup that automatically and continuously protects the data on your computer so that if disaster strikes, you can easily recover your files without missing a beat.




1 in 10 computers
are infected with viruses each month. †
















Won't it cost a lot?





Not at all! Cloud backup is very affordable – especially when you consider the potential cost of losing your irreplaceable documents or your priceless photos and videos.
Carbonite offers a variety of plans, so whatever your backup needs are, there’s a wallet-friendly plan to keep your files protected.




It costs just

to protect your data with Carbonite’s Personal Basic Plan.

Carbonite (online backup) - Wikipedia




















 






Carbonite (online backup)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carbonite is an online backup service, available to Windows and macOS users, that backs up documents, e-mails, music, photos, and settings.[1] It is named after carbonite, the fictional substance used to freeze Han Solo in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.[2] It was the first such service to offer unlimited backup space for a fixed price.[3] Previously, all online backup services were priced by the gigabyte; many other vendors[which?] have since changed to an unlimited model.
Carbonite offers two separate lines of products: Carbonite Home and Home Office for individuals, families, and one- or two-person businesses; and Carbonite Small Business for businesses with three or more computers.[4]
Carbonite was named "Best Windows Backup Tool" by Lifehacker,[5] "Labs Winner" by PC Pro, "Editor's Choice" by NextAdvisor,[6] Hottest Boston Company by Lead411,[7] but received only "two mice" in a MacWorld review putting it second to last.[8]

Product details[edit]
Carbonite Online Backup installs a client software program (Windows and Mac operating systems only, Linux-based systems are not supported) on the user’s computer that operates continuously in the background. This client software automatically seeks out new and changed files on the user’s computer and backs them up using incremental backup.[9] Each file is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit Blowfish encryption before it is sent to remote servers at the company's data centers via the Internet. (This of course requires that the user's computer be continually connected to the internet, and the speed of the internet connection will impact system performance.) Data is transmitted to the servers using a secure SSL link.[10] The encrypted files are stored on 15-drive RAID 6 storage arrays.[11] The client software also provides de-duplication at the bit level only. Thus files moved to a new drive will be backed up twice.
The program is designed to automatically back up user-generated content including text documents, spreadsheets, financial documents, photos, music, etc. Specifically, on a Windows PC, Carbonite backs up everything in the Documents and Settings folder, including the desktop, favorites, and all other files except for temporary, log and video files. Any file or folder can be added to the default backup[12] if it is on a local (internal) drive formatted with the FAT32 or NTFS file systems. (According to the Carbonite website, the Home version will only backup internal drives whereas the HomePlus and HomePremium versions will also backup external drives.) The backup software integrates with Windows Explorer, adding green dots to the file icons of any backed up file.[13] Adding or removing files from the backup is done using the right mouse button and the Windows context menus. The Windows version of Carbonite will keep multiple versions of backed up files.[14] Carbonite can recover from some forms of Ransomware[15] but this requires contacting Carbonite customer service. For Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard),[16] Carbonite is controlled through System Preferences and using the contextual menu. File systems supported 'by default' on Mac OS X are supported by the Mac client with the exception of FAT. Note that Carbonite is not fully compatible with Lion, consuming around 100% CPU during backup.
The program also includes a remote access application that allows individual files to be downloaded to any computer using a web browser.[17]
Company profile[edit]
CEO David Friend and CTO Jeff Flowers founded Carbonite in 2005, the fifth joint venture for the pair who also together founded Computer Pictures, Pilot Software, FaxNet and Sonexis.[18] Friend had also been an executive at ARP Instruments, Inc., a pioneering electronic music synthesizer manufacturer, in the 1970s.
Since its launch in 2006, Carbonite has backed up more than 100 billion files and has restored more than 7 billion lost files for its customers.[19]
Carbonite introduced their Macintosh version for Intel-based Macs with OS 10.4 or 10.5 in March 2009.[20]
History[edit]
The product debuted at Staples in 2006 when it focused on photo backup and offered a free six-month subscription with all camera purchases.[21] It partnered with Microsoft in 2006 to include the program with purchase of Microsoft Money 2007.[22] and renewed the following year for the 2008[23]
In 2007 it was named ‘Top Private Company’ by AlwaysOn in 2007.[24]
It has partnered with several other backup, storage, and file transfer companies: with Ipswitch,Inc. in 2007 to provide the service to purchasers of their FTP client,[25] OLBEX in 2007 to offer the service to U.S. cable companies,[26] Sonic Solutions in 2008 to provide core technologies for their digital media storage solution,[27] and with TDS Telecom in 2008 to provide core technologies for their online backup service,[28] and with LaCie in 2008,to power their online backup.[29] It partnered[30] with Lifeboat Distribution in 2008, to enhance distribution coverage within North America.[31]
It partnered with Packard Bell in 2008, the first partnership between an independent online backup company and major PC manufacturer, providing all purchasers of their desktop and notepad computers in Europe a free four-month subscription.[30] It subsequently partnered also with Lenovo in 2008, to have the service pre-loaded on their PCs,[32] and with Acer to have their online backup service pre-installed on select PCs. Acer [33] signed on for a similar arrangement in 2009.
In 2009, it admitted loss of backups of "over 7,500 customers" in a lawsuit filed against Promise Technology, a hardware provider.[34]
On June 6, 2011, Carbonite acquired Phanfare. Carbonite declined to honor Phanfare lifetime memberships, instead granting lifetime members $299 in Phanfare credit which would expire after three years if unused.[35] Two days later, Phanfare founder and CEO, Andrew Erlichson notified lifetime subscribers that customers requesting a refund will be paid not by Carbonite, but what remains of Phanfare, Inc.[36]
Funding[edit]
In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."
Amazon review controversy[edit]
Carbonite reviews on Amazon were a subject of controversy in early 2009. Apparently, employees of the company posted favorable testimonial-style ads on Amazon in 2006, including those by senior members of the management team.[42] Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009.[43]
Misleading advertising controversy[edit]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited.[44][45] Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was "likely to mislead consumers".
Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges.[46]
Carbonite states they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.[47]

Carbonite (online backup)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carbonite is an online backup service, available to Windows and macOS users, that backs up documents, e-mails, music, photos, and settings.[1] It is named after carbonite, the fictional substance used to freeze Han Solo in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.[2] It was the first such service to offer unlimited backup space for a fixed price.[3] Previously, all online backup services were priced by the gigabyte; many other vendors[which?] have since changed to an unlimited model.
Carbonite offers two separate lines of products: Carbonite Home and Home Office for individuals, families, and one- or two-person businesses; and Carbonite Small Business for businesses with three or more computers.[4]
Carbonite was named "Best Windows Backup Tool" by Lifehacker,[5] "Labs Winner" by PC Pro, "Editor's Choice" by NextAdvisor,[6] Hottest Boston Company by Lead411,[7] but received only "two mice" in a MacWorld review putting it second to last.[8]

Product details[edit]
Carbonite Online Backup installs a client software program (Windows and Mac operating systems only, Linux-based systems are not supported) on the user’s computer that operates continuously in the background. This client software automatically seeks out new and changed files on the user’s computer and backs them up using incremental backup.[9] Each file is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit Blowfish encryption before it is sent to remote servers at the company's data centers via the Internet. (This of course requires that the user's computer be continually connected to the internet, and the speed of the internet connection will impact system performance.) Data is transmitted to the servers using a secure SSL link.[10] The encrypted files are stored on 15-drive RAID 6 storage arrays.[11] The client software also provides de-duplication at the bit level only. Thus files moved to a new drive will be backed up twice.
The program is designed to automatically back up user-generated content including text documents, spreadsheets, financial documents, photos, music, etc. Specifically, on a Windows PC, Carbonite backs up everything in the Documents and Settings folder, including the desktop, favorites, and all other files except for temporary, log and video files. Any file or folder can be added to the default backup[12] if it is on a local (internal) drive formatted with the FAT32 or NTFS file systems. (According to the Carbonite website, the Home version will only backup internal drives whereas the HomePlus and HomePremium versions will also backup external drives.) The backup software integrates with Windows Explorer, adding green dots to the file icons of any backed up file.[13] Adding or removing files from the backup is done using the right mouse button and the Windows context menus. The Windows version of Carbonite will keep multiple versions of backed up files.[14] Carbonite can recover from some forms of Ransomware[15] but this requires contacting Carbonite customer service. For Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard),[16] Carbonite is controlled through System Preferences and using the contextual menu. File systems supported 'by default' on Mac OS X are supported by the Mac client with the exception of FAT. Note that Carbonite is not fully compatible with Lion, consuming around 100% CPU during backup.
The program also includes a remote access application that allows individual files to be downloaded to any computer using a web browser.[17]
Company profile[edit]
CEO David Friend and CTO Jeff Flowers founded Carbonite in 2005, the fifth joint venture for the pair who also together founded Computer Pictures, Pilot Software, FaxNet and Sonexis.[18] Friend had also been an executive at ARP Instruments, Inc., a pioneering electronic music synthesizer manufacturer, in the 1970s.
Since its launch in 2006, Carbonite has backed up more than 100 billion files and has restored more than 7 billion lost files for its customers.[19]
Carbonite introduced their Macintosh version for Intel-based Macs with OS 10.4 or 10.5 in March 2009.[20]
History[edit]
The product debuted at Staples in 2006 when it focused on photo backup and offered a free six-month subscription with all camera purchases.[21] It partnered with Microsoft in 2006 to include the program with purchase of Microsoft Money 2007.[22] and renewed the following year for the 2008[23]
In 2007 it was named ‘Top Private Company’ by AlwaysOn in 2007.[24]
It has partnered with several other backup, storage, and file transfer companies: with Ipswitch,Inc. in 2007 to provide the service to purchasers of their FTP client,[25] OLBEX in 2007 to offer the service to U.S. cable companies,[26] Sonic Solutions in 2008 to provide core technologies for their digital media storage solution,[27] and with TDS Telecom in 2008 to provide core technologies for their online backup service,[28] and with LaCie in 2008,to power their online backup.[29] It partnered[30] with Lifeboat Distribution in 2008, to enhance distribution coverage within North America.[31]
It partnered with Packard Bell in 2008, the first partnership between an independent online backup company and major PC manufacturer, providing all purchasers of their desktop and notepad computers in Europe a free four-month subscription.[30] It subsequently partnered also with Lenovo in 2008, to have the service pre-loaded on their PCs,[32] and with Acer to have their online backup service pre-installed on select PCs. Acer [33] signed on for a similar arrangement in 2009.
In 2009, it admitted loss of backups of "over 7,500 customers" in a lawsuit filed against Promise Technology, a hardware provider.[34]
On June 6, 2011, Carbonite acquired Phanfare. Carbonite declined to honor Phanfare lifetime memberships, instead granting lifetime members $299 in Phanfare credit which would expire after three years if unused.[35] Two days later, Phanfare founder and CEO, Andrew Erlichson notified lifetime subscribers that customers requesting a refund will be paid not by Carbonite, but what remains of Phanfare, Inc.[36]
Funding[edit]
In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."
Amazon review controversy[edit]
Carbonite reviews on Amazon were a subject of controversy in early 2009. Apparently, employees of the company posted favorable testimonial-style ads on Amazon in 2006, including those by senior members of the management team.[42] Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009.[43]
Misleading advertising controversy[edit]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited.[44][45] Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was "likely to mislead consumers".
Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges.[46]
Carbonite states they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.[47]

In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."
Amazon review controversy[edit]
Carbonite reviews on Amazon were a subject of controversy in early 2009. Apparently, employees of the company posted favorable testimonial-style ads on Amazon in 2006, including those by senior members of the management team.[42] Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009.[43]
Misleading advertising controversy[edit]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited.[44][45] Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was "likely to mislead consumers".
Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges.[46]
Carbonite states they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.[47]

Carbonite (online backup)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carbonite is an online backup service, available to Windows and macOS users, that backs up documents, e-mails, music, photos, and settings.[1] It is named after carbonite, the fictional substance used to freeze Han Solo in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.[2] It was the first such service to offer unlimited backup space for a fixed price.[3] Previously, all online backup services were priced by the gigabyte; many other vendors[which?] have since changed to an unlimited model.
Carbonite offers two separate lines of products: Carbonite Home and Home Office for individuals, families, and one- or two-person businesses; and Carbonite Small Business for businesses with three or more computers.[4]
Carbonite was named "Best Windows Backup Tool" by Lifehacker,[5] "Labs Winner" by PC Pro, "Editor's Choice" by NextAdvisor,[6] Hottest Boston Company by Lead411,[7] but received only "two mice" in a MacWorld review putting it second to last.[8]

Product details[edit]
Carbonite Online Backup installs a client software program (Windows and Mac operating systems only, Linux-based systems are not supported) on the user’s computer that operates continuously in the background. This client software automatically seeks out new and changed files on the user’s computer and backs them up using incremental backup.[9] Each file is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit Blowfish encryption before it is sent to remote servers at the company's data centers via the Internet. (This of course requires that the user's computer be continually connected to the internet, and the speed of the internet connection will impact system performance.) Data is transmitted to the servers using a secure SSL link.[10] The encrypted files are stored on 15-drive RAID 6 storage arrays.[11] The client software also provides de-duplication at the bit level only. Thus files moved to a new drive will be backed up twice.
The program is designed to automatically back up user-generated content including text documents, spreadsheets, financial documents, photos, music, etc. Specifically, on a Windows PC, Carbonite backs up everything in the Documents and Settings folder, including the desktop, favorites, and all other files except for temporary, log and video files. Any file or folder can be added to the default backup[12] if it is on a local (internal) drive formatted with the FAT32 or NTFS file systems. (According to the Carbonite website, the Home version will only backup internal drives whereas the HomePlus and HomePremium versions will also backup external drives.) The backup software integrates with Windows Explorer, adding green dots to the file icons of any backed up file.[13] Adding or removing files from the backup is done using the right mouse button and the Windows context menus. The Windows version of Carbonite will keep multiple versions of backed up files.[14] Carbonite can recover from some forms of Ransomware[15] but this requires contacting Carbonite customer service. For Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard),[16] Carbonite is controlled through System Preferences and using the contextual menu. File systems supported 'by default' on Mac OS X are supported by the Mac client with the exception of FAT. Note that Carbonite is not fully compatible with Lion, consuming around 100% CPU during backup.
The program also includes a remote access application that allows individual files to be downloaded to any computer using a web browser.[17]
Company profile[edit]
CEO David Friend and CTO Jeff Flowers founded Carbonite in 2005, the fifth joint venture for the pair who also together founded Computer Pictures, Pilot Software, FaxNet and Sonexis.[18] Friend had also been an executive at ARP Instruments, Inc., a pioneering electronic music synthesizer manufacturer, in the 1970s.
Since its launch in 2006, Carbonite has backed up more than 100 billion files and has restored more than 7 billion lost files for its customers.[19]
Carbonite introduced their Macintosh version for Intel-based Macs with OS 10.4 or 10.5 in March 2009.[20]
History[edit]
The product debuted at Staples in 2006 when it focused on photo backup and offered a free six-month subscription with all camera purchases.[21] It partnered with Microsoft in 2006 to include the program with purchase of Microsoft Money 2007.[22] and renewed the following year for the 2008[23]
In 2007 it was named ‘Top Private Company’ by AlwaysOn in 2007.[24]
It has partnered with several other backup, storage, and file transfer companies: with Ipswitch,Inc. in 2007 to provide the service to purchasers of their FTP client,[25] OLBEX in 2007 to offer the service to U.S. cable companies,[26] Sonic Solutions in 2008 to provide core technologies for their digital media storage solution,[27] and with TDS Telecom in 2008 to provide core technologies for their online backup service,[28] and with LaCie in 2008,to power their online backup.[29] It partnered[30] with Lifeboat Distribution in 2008, to enhance distribution coverage within North America.[31]
It partnered with Packard Bell in 2008, the first partnership between an independent online backup company and major PC manufacturer, providing all purchasers of their desktop and notepad computers in Europe a free four-month subscription.[30] It subsequently partnered also with Lenovo in 2008, to have the service pre-loaded on their PCs,[32] and with Acer to have their online backup service pre-installed on select PCs. Acer [33] signed on for a similar arrangement in 2009.
In 2009, it admitted loss of backups of "over 7,500 customers" in a lawsuit filed against Promise Technology, a hardware provider.[34]
On June 6, 2011, Carbonite acquired Phanfare. Carbonite declined to honor Phanfare lifetime memberships, instead granting lifetime members $299 in Phanfare credit which would expire after three years if unused.[35] Two days later, Phanfare founder and CEO, Andrew Erlichson notified lifetime subscribers that customers requesting a refund will be paid not by Carbonite, but what remains of Phanfare, Inc.[36]
Funding[edit]
In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."

Carbonite (online backup)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Carbonite is an online backup service, available to Windows and macOS users, that backs up documents, e-mails, music, photos, and settings.[1] It is named after carbonite, the fictional substance used to freeze Han Solo in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.[2] It was the first such service to offer unlimited backup space for a fixed price.[3] Previously, all online backup services were priced by the gigabyte; many other vendors[which?] have since changed to an unlimited model.
Carbonite offers two separate lines of products: Carbonite Home and Home Office for individuals, families, and one- or two-person businesses; and Carbonite Small Business for businesses with three or more computers.[4]
Carbonite was named "Best Windows Backup Tool" by Lifehacker,[5] "Labs Winner" by PC Pro, "Editor's Choice" by NextAdvisor,[6] Hottest Boston Company by Lead411,[7] but received only "two mice" in a MacWorld review putting it second to last.[8]

Product details[edit]
Carbonite Online Backup installs a client software program (Windows and Mac operating systems only, Linux-based systems are not supported) on the user’s computer that operates continuously in the background. This client software automatically seeks out new and changed files on the user’s computer and backs them up using incremental backup.[9] Each file is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit Blowfish encryption before it is sent to remote servers at the company's data centers via the Internet. (This of course requires that the user's computer be continually connected to the internet, and the speed of the internet connection will impact system performance.) Data is transmitted to the servers using a secure SSL link.[10] The encrypted files are stored on 15-drive RAID 6 storage arrays.[11] The client software also provides de-duplication at the bit level only. Thus files moved to a new drive will be backed up twice.
The program is designed to automatically back up user-generated content including text documents, spreadsheets, financial documents, photos, music, etc. Specifically, on a Windows PC, Carbonite backs up everything in the Documents and Settings folder, including the desktop, favorites, and all other files except for temporary, log and video files. Any file or folder can be added to the default backup[12] if it is on a local (internal) drive formatted with the FAT32 or NTFS file systems. (According to the Carbonite website, the Home version will only backup internal drives whereas the HomePlus and HomePremium versions will also backup external drives.) The backup software integrates with Windows Explorer, adding green dots to the file icons of any backed up file.[13] Adding or removing files from the backup is done using the right mouse button and the Windows context menus. The Windows version of Carbonite will keep multiple versions of backed up files.[14] Carbonite can recover from some forms of Ransomware[15] but this requires contacting Carbonite customer service. For Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or 10.5 (Leopard),[16] Carbonite is controlled through System Preferences and using the contextual menu. File systems supported 'by default' on Mac OS X are supported by the Mac client with the exception of FAT. Note that Carbonite is not fully compatible with Lion, consuming around 100% CPU during backup.
The program also includes a remote access application that allows individual files to be downloaded to any computer using a web browser.[17]
Company profile[edit]
CEO David Friend and CTO Jeff Flowers founded Carbonite in 2005, the fifth joint venture for the pair who also together founded Computer Pictures, Pilot Software, FaxNet and Sonexis.[18] Friend had also been an executive at ARP Instruments, Inc., a pioneering electronic music synthesizer manufacturer, in the 1970s.
Since its launch in 2006, Carbonite has backed up more than 100 billion files and has restored more than 7 billion lost files for its customers.[19]
Carbonite introduced their Macintosh version for Intel-based Macs with OS 10.4 or 10.5 in March 2009.[20]
History[edit]
The product debuted at Staples in 2006 when it focused on photo backup and offered a free six-month subscription with all camera purchases.[21] It partnered with Microsoft in 2006 to include the program with purchase of Microsoft Money 2007.[22] and renewed the following year for the 2008[23]
In 2007 it was named ‘Top Private Company’ by AlwaysOn in 2007.[24]
It has partnered with several other backup, storage, and file transfer companies: with Ipswitch,Inc. in 2007 to provide the service to purchasers of their FTP client,[25] OLBEX in 2007 to offer the service to U.S. cable companies,[26] Sonic Solutions in 2008 to provide core technologies for their digital media storage solution,[27] and with TDS Telecom in 2008 to provide core technologies for their online backup service,[28] and with LaCie in 2008,to power their online backup.[29] It partnered[30] with Lifeboat Distribution in 2008, to enhance distribution coverage within North America.[31]
It partnered with Packard Bell in 2008, the first partnership between an independent online backup company and major PC manufacturer, providing all purchasers of their desktop and notepad computers in Europe a free four-month subscription.[30] It subsequently partnered also with Lenovo in 2008, to have the service pre-loaded on their PCs,[32] and with Acer to have their online backup service pre-installed on select PCs. Acer [33] signed on for a similar arrangement in 2009.
In 2009, it admitted loss of backups of "over 7,500 customers" in a lawsuit filed against Promise Technology, a hardware provider.[34]
On June 6, 2011, Carbonite acquired Phanfare. Carbonite declined to honor Phanfare lifetime memberships, instead granting lifetime members $299 in Phanfare credit which would expire after three years if unused.[35] Two days later, Phanfare founder and CEO, Andrew Erlichson notified lifetime subscribers that customers requesting a refund will be paid not by Carbonite, but what remains of Phanfare, Inc.[36]
Funding[edit]
In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."
Amazon review controversy[edit]
Carbonite reviews on Amazon were a subject of controversy in early 2009. Apparently, employees of the company posted favorable testimonial-style ads on Amazon in 2006, including those by senior members of the management team.[42] Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009.[43]
Misleading advertising controversy[edit]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited.[44][45] Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was "likely to mislead consumers".
Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges.[46]
Carbonite states they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.[47]

In 2006, it secured $2.5 million in series A financing from 3i and CommonAngels;[37] in 2007 it completed $15 million series B financing led by Menlo Ventures.[38] in 2008 it secured additional $5 million in series B-2 funding[26] and completed C round financing with approximately $20 million of new capital, led by Performance Equity of Stamford, Connecticut;[39] in 2010 it closed a mezzanine round of funding with the total financing raised to $67 million.[40] Carbonite made its IPO in August 2011, raising $62.5 million in its offering.[41] On 4 Feb 2013, Carbonite announced that its net loss for the full year 2012 was ($18.9) million, compared to ($23.5) million in 2011. Since its inception in 2005, NASDAQ:CARB has lost in excess of ($120,000,000) of public and private investment. The company's SEC financial reports state: "We do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future."
Amazon review controversy[edit]
Carbonite reviews on Amazon were a subject of controversy in early 2009. Apparently, employees of the company posted favorable testimonial-style ads on Amazon in 2006, including those by senior members of the management team.[42] Additionally, the New York Times reported that the CEO was made aware of the situation in September 2008 but did nothing to remove the false postings until the NY Times blog appeared in January 2009.[43]
Misleading advertising controversy[edit]
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the United Kingdom ruled on August 1, 2012, that Carbonite had misled consumers by describing its online backup as unlimited.[44][45] Following a complaint, the ASA investigated and found that due to bandwidth restrictions for uploading data, which limit upload to 2 Mbit/s for the first 200 GB but then to only 100 kbit/s once 200 GB had been exceeded, the backup was not unlimited. Therefore, the advert was "likely to mislead consumers".
Additionally, Carbonite breached rule 1.7 of the CAP Code for failing to respond to the ASA's charges.[46]
Carbonite states they have eliminated bandwidth throttling for all of their customers.[47]
