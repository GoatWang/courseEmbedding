of the Notes and the registration of transfers and exchanges of the
Notes (the “ Register ”). The Indenture Trustee
shall initially be the Registrar for the purpose of registering the

anything to the contrary contained herein, the Registrar shall know
only the Person in whose name a Note is registered in the Register,

paying agent or otherwise) and the Registrar shall run only to such
Persons.

(b)      If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Registrar, the
Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of
the appointment of such Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Register. The Indenture Trustee
shall have the right to inspect the Register at all reasonable
times and to obtain copies thereof. The Indenture Trustee shall
have the right to fully rely upon a certificate executed on behalf
of the Registrar by an authorized officer thereof as to the names
and addresses of the Noteholders and the principal amounts and
number of such Notes until such time as an updated certificate is
provided by the Registrar to the Indenture Trustee at which time it
will be entitled to fully rely on such replacement certificate.

(c)      Upon surrender for
registration of transfer of any Note at the Corporate Trust Office
of the Indenture Trustee or the Agency Office (and following the
delivery, in the former case, of such Notes to the Issuer by the
Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall execute, the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal amount.

(d)      At the option of the
Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same
Class in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount and upon surrender of such Notes to be exchanged
at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee or the
Agency Office (and following the delivery, in the former case, of
Notes to the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall
execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the
Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture Trustee, such Notes
which the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to
receive.

(e)      All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of other Notes shall be the
valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
4



(f)      Every Note presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Registrar,
duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney
duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or trust company.

(g)      No service charge shall be
made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, but the Issuer or Indenture Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to
Section 2.03(b) or Section 9.05 not involving any
transfer.

(h)      The preceding provisions of
this Section 2.04 notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be
required to transfer or make exchanges, and the Registrar need not
register transfers or exchanges, (i) of Notes that are due for
repayment within fifteen (15) days of submission to the
Corporate Trust Office or the Agency Office or (ii) of Notes
selected for redemption.

(i)      Neither the Indenture
Trustee nor the Registrar shall have any responsibility to monitor
or restrict the transfer of beneficial ownership in any Note an
interest in which is transferable through the facilities of the
Depository. In addition, neither the Indenture Trustee nor the
Registrar shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine
or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer
imposed under this Indenture or under Applicable Law with respect
to any transfer of any interest in any Note other than to require
delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence
as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly
required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same
to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express
requirements hereof.

Section 2.05     Mutilated, Destroyed,
Lost or Stolen Notes .    If (i) any
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the
Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or wrongful taking of any Note, and
(ii) there is delivered to the Issuer, Registrar and Indenture
Trustee such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by
it to hold the Issuer, Registrar and the Indenture Trustee,
respectively, harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Issuer, the Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has
been acquired by a Protected Purchaser, and provided that the
requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, the Issuer
shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Note, a replacement Note of
like tenor and principal amount; provided, however, that if any
such destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Note, but not a mutilated
Note, shall have become or within fifteen (15) days shall be
due and payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead
of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed,
lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption
Date without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such
replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or wrongfully
taken Note, a Protected Purchaser of the original Note in lieu of
which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment such
original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a Protected
Purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover
 
5


upon the security or
indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost
or expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.

Upon the issuance of any replacement Note under this
Section 2.05, the Issuer may require the payment by the Holder
of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Indenture Trustee or the Registrar) connected therewith.

Every replacement Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.05 in
replacement of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken
Note shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation
of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or
wrongfully taken Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone,
and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture
equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly
issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.05 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Notes.

Section 2.06     Persons Deemed
Owners .    Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer of any Note, the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Registrar and any agent of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee or the Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered (as of the day of determination) as the owner of
such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and
interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and none of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Registrar or any agent of the
Issuer, the Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.

Section 2.07     Payment of Principal
and Interest .    The Notes shall accrue
interest during each Interest Period at the applicable Interest
Rate, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Notes, and
shall be payable from amounts deposited in the Collection Account

Agreement or Section 5.04(b) hereof. Interest accrued on the
Notes during an Interest Period shall be due and payable on the
related Payment Date.

will be due and payable in accordance with Section 5.04(b) of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement or Section 5.04(b) hereof.
The principal of the Notes shall also be due and payable as
follows: (i) on the Redemption Date, in an amount equal to the
outstanding Note Balance, (ii) on the date of acceleration of
the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02 in the
amount of the outstanding Note Balance and (iii) to the extent
any Class of Notes remain and have not been paid prior to such
date, on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date for such Class of
Notes in an amount equal to the outstanding Note Balance of such
Class of Notes.

(b)       Any installment of interest
or principal payable with respect to a Note that is punctually paid
or duly provided for by the Issuer on the applicable Payment Date
shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note is registered
on the Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account of any such Noteholder at a bank or other entity
 
6

Co.) for which Definitive Notes have not been issued pursuant to
Section 2.13, payment shall be made by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to Cede & Co., for further
credit to the account designated by such Holder. The final
distribution on each Note will be made in like manner, but only
upon presentation and surrender of such Note at the Corporate Trust

Noteholders of such final distribution. With respect to Book-Entry
Notes for which Definitive Notes have not been issued, such notice
shall be sent on the Business Day prior to such Payment Date by
facsimile, and with respect to Definitive Notes, such notice shall
be sent not later than three (3) Business Days after such

case, shall specify that such final installment shall be payable

not received notice of such expected Final Scheduled Payment Date
from the Issuer not later than two (2) Business Days after the
Record Date. Notices in connection with redemptions of Notes shall
be mailed to Noteholders as provided in Section 10.02. The
funds represented by any such checks returned undelivered shall be
held in accordance with Section 3.03. The final interest
payment on each Class of Notes is due on the date on which the Note
Balance of that Class of Notes is reduced to zero (including any
Redemption Date and the applicable Final Scheduled Payment

Section 2.08     Cancellation
.    All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer, exchange or redemption shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled

Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder that the Issuer may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall
be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as
provided in this Section 2.08, except as expressly permitted
by this Indenture. All cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of
by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention
or disposal policy as in effect at the time.

Section 2.09     Tax Treatment;
Withholding .

(a)       The Issuer has entered into
this Indenture, and the Notes will be issued, with the intention
that, for federal, State and local income, single business and
franchise tax purposes, the Notes will qualify as indebtedness
secured by the Collateral, and, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, the Noteholders and the Owners agree that, by
acquiring any Note or interest therein, that it will not take a
position contrary to such treatment. The Issuer, by entering into
this Indenture agree solely for federal, State and local income,
single business and franchise tax purposes, (i) to treat the
Notes as indebtedness secured by the Collateral and (ii) not
to treat the Issuer as an association (or publicly-traded
partnership) taxable as a corporation, in each case,
 
7


unless such treatment
has been determined to be contrary to Applicable Law by a decision,
judgment, decree or other order by any court of competent
jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree or other order is
final and binding after all appeals allowed by Applicable Law.

(b)       In the event that any
withholding tax is imposed on payments to a Noteholder, such tax
shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to such Noteholder
in accordance with this Section. The Indenture Trustee or Paying
Agent is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts
otherwise distributable to the Noteholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally owed with respect to such
payment (but such authorization shall not prevent the Indenture
Trustee or the Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in
appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if
permitted by Applicable Law, pending the outcome of such
proceedings; provided, however, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying
Agent shall not be required to contest any tax). The amount of any
withholding tax imposed with respect to a Noteholder shall be
treated as cash distributed to such Noteholder at the time it is
withheld by Indenture Trustee or Paying Agent and remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that
withholding tax is payable with respect to a payment (such as a
payment to a non-U.S. Noteholder), the Indenture Trustee or the
Paying Agent may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this paragraph with no liability therefor.

(c)      Prior to the receipt of any
interest payment, any Noteholder or its transferee that is a United
States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
shall (i) provide the Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent
with Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor form) or
(ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Indenture Trustee
and the Paying Agent that it is exempt from backup withholding.
Each Noteholder or its transferee agrees by acceptance of a Note
that, upon request of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the
Paying Agent, such Noteholder or its transferee will provide the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent with a
supplemental Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or successor
form) to the extent legally able to do so and that each Noteholder
or its transferee shall notify the Indenture Trustee or Paying
Agent should subsequent circumstances render such forms or
exemptions incorrect or invalid. The Indenture Trustee and the
Paying Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon, and each
Noteholder or its transferee by its acceptance of a Note hereunder
agrees to indemnify and hold the Indenture Trustee and the Paying
Agent harmless against all claims or liability of any kind arising
in connection with or related to the Indenture Trustee’s and
the Paying Agent’s reliance upon, any documents, forms or
information provided by any Noteholder or its transferee to the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.09.

(d)      Prior to the receipt of any
interest payment, any Noteholder, and upon transfer, any transferee
that is not a United States person (as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall provide the Indenture
Trustee and the Paying Agent with an applicable Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 (or successor forms). Each Noteholder or
transferee agrees by acceptance of a Note that, upon request of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent, such Noteholder
or transferee will provide the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the
Paying Agent with a supplemental applicable Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 (or successor forms) to the extent legally
able to do so and that each Noteholder or its transferee shall
notify the Indenture Trustee or Paying Agent should subsequent
circumstances render such forms incorrect or invalid. The Indenture
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be fully protected in relying
upon, and each Noteholder or its transferee by its acceptance of a
Note hereunder agrees to indemnify and hold
 
8


the Indenture Trustee
and the Paying Agent harmless against all claims or liability of
any kind arising in connection with or related to the Indenture
Trustee’s and the Paying Agent’s reliance upon, any
documents, forms or information provided by any Noteholder or its
transferee to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.09.

Section 2.10     [Reserved]

Section 2.11     Book-Entry Notes
.    Each Note, upon original issuance, shall
be issued in the form of a typewritten Note or Notes representing
the Book-Entry Notes, which shall be deposited on behalf of the
purchasers of the Notes represented by such Book-Entry Note with
the Depository or the Indenture Trustee, as custodian for the
Depository, and registered on the Register in the name of the
Depository or a nominee thereof (initially, such nominee to be
Cede & Co.). No Owner shall receive a Definitive Note
representing such Owner’s interest in such Notes, except as
provided in Section 2.13. Unless and until Definitive Notes
have been issued to such Owners pursuant to Section 2.13:

(i)     the provisions of this
Section 2.11 shall be in full force and effect;

(ii)    the Registrar, the Paying Agent and the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Depository for
all purposes of this Indenture (including the payment of principal
of and interest on such Notes and the giving of instructions or
directions hereunder) as the sole Holder of such Notes and shall
have no obligation to such Owners;

(iii)    to the extent that the provisions of
this Section 2.11 conflict with any other provisions of this
Indenture, the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall
control;

(iv)    the rights of the Owners shall be
exercised only through the Depository and shall be limited to those
established by Applicable Law and agreements between such Owners
and the Depository and/or the Depository Participants, and unless
and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to
Section 2.13, the initial Depository shall make book-entry
transfers between the Depository Participants and receive and
transmit payments of principal of and interest on such Notes to
such Depository Participants, pursuant to the Depository Agreement;
and

(v)    whenever this Indenture requires or
permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions
of Holders of Notes evidencing a specified percentage of the Note
Balance of the Outstanding Notes, the Depository shall be deemed to
represent such percentage only to the extent that it has
(x) received written instructions to such effect from Owners
and/or Depository Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in the Notes and (y) delivered such instructions to the
Indenture Trustee.

Section 2.12     Notices to
Depository .    Whenever a notice or other
communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture,
unless and until Definitive Notes representing such Notes shall
have been issued to the related Owners pursuant to
Section 2.13, the Indenture Trustee shall give all such
notices and communications specified herein to be given to the
related Noteholders to the Depository and shall have no obligation
to such Owners.

Section 2.13     Definitive Notes
.    If for any Notes issued as Book-Entry
Notes, the Administrator advises the Indenture Trustee in
writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able to
properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to such Notes
and the Issuer is unable to locate a qualified successor, then the
Depository shall notify all Owners and the Indenture Trustee in
writing of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability
of Definitive Notes to such Owners requesting the same. Upon
surrender to the Indenture Trustee of the typewritten Notes or
Notes representing such Book-Entry Notes by the Depository,
accompanied by registration instructions, the Issuer shall execute
and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the related Definitive
Notes in accordance with the instructions of the Depository. None
of the Issuer, the Administrator, the Registrar or the Indenture
Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of
such Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the
Holders of such Definitive Notes as Noteholders. The Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable if the Administrator or the Indenture
Trustee is unable to locate a qualified successor Depository.

If Definitive Notes are issued and the Indenture Trustee is not the
Registrar, the Issuer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Indenture Trustee a list of the names and addresses of the
Noteholders (i) as of each Record Date, within five
(5) days thereafter and (ii) within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Issuer of a request
therefor.

Section 2.14     Depositor as
Noteholder .    The Depositor in its
individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of
Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Depositor.

Section 2.15     [Reserved] .

Section 2.16     Additional Transfer
Restrictions .    The transfer and exchange
of Book-Entry Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be
affected through the Depository, in accordance with this Indenture
and the procedures of the Depository therefor, which shall include
restrictions on transfer comparable to those set forth herein to
the extent required by the Securities Act. Beneficial interests in
a Book-Entry Note may be transferred to Persons who take delivery
thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the same Book-Entry
Note in accordance with the transfer restrictions set forth in the
Section 2.04 and on the legends on the forms of the Notes.

Section 2.17     ERISA
.    The Notes may, in general, be purchased
by, or on behalf of, or with “plan assets” of a Benefit
Plan. A fiduciary of a Benefit Plan purchasing any such Class of
Notes or a beneficial interest in such Notes, with the assets of a
Benefit Plan is deemed to represent that the purchase of one or
more such Notes or a beneficial interest therein is consistent with
its fiduciary duties under ERISA and does not result in a nonexempt
prohibited transaction as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code. If the Depositor, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or any of their respective
Affiliates (i) has investment or administrative discretion
with respect to the assets of a Benefit Plan, (ii) has
authority or responsibility to give, or regularly gives, investment
advice with respect to such Benefit Plan assets, for a fee and
pursuant to an agreement or understanding that such advice will
(a) serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with
respect to such Benefit Plan assets and (b) be based
 
10


on the particular
investment needs for such Benefit Plan or (iii) is an employer
maintaining or contributing to such Benefit Plan, then a purchase
of any such Class of Notes by such a Benefit Plan may represent a
conflict of interest or act of self-dealing by the fiduciary.

(v)    comply with all requirements of the Code
with respect to the withholding from any payments made by it on any
Notes of any applicable withholding taxes imposed thereon and with
respect to any applicable reporting requirements in connection
therewith.

The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other
purpose, by Issuer Order direct any Paying Agent to pay to the
Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent, such
sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which the sums were held by such Paying Agent; and upon
such payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture Trustee, such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with
respect to such money.

Subject to Applicable Laws with respect to escheat of funds, any
money held by the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust

paid upon Issuer Request to the Issuer; and the Holder of such Note

the Issuer for payment thereof (but only to the extent of the
amounts so paid to the Issuer), and all liability of the Indenture
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee or
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, shall at the expense and written direction of the Issuer
cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English
language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general
circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money remains
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not
be less than thirty (30) days from the date of such
publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining
will be repaid to the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee shall also
adopt and employ, at the expense and written direction of the
Issuer, any other reasonable means of notification of such
repayment (including mailing notice of such repayment to Holders
whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for
redemption or whose right to or interest in moneys due and

Paying Agent, at the last address of record for each such
Holder).

to it to remedy such failure.

therein or the proceeds thereof (other than tax liens,
mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising
solely as a result of an action or omission of the related
Obligor), (iii) permit the lien of this Indenture not to
constitute a valid first priority (other than with respect to any

Collateral, (iv) dissolve or liquidate in whole or in part or
(v) merge or consolidate with, or transfer substantially all

become liable for any indebtedness other than the indebtedness
evidenced by the Notes or indebtedness otherwise permitted by the

ARTICLE V

EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES

Section 5.01     Events of Default
.    “Event of Default,” wherever
used herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the
reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary
or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to
any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Authority):

(a)    default in the payment of any interest
on any Note of the Controlling Class when the same becomes due and
payable, and such default shall continue for a period of five
(5) days;
 
21



(b)    default in the payment of the principal
of any Note on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date or the
Redemption Date;

(c)    any failure by the Issuer to duly
observe or perform any of its covenants or agreements or a breach
of any of its representations and warranties in this Indenture
(other than as specified above in clauses (a) and (b)), which
failure has a Material Adverse Effect on the Noteholders and which
continues unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days; or

(d)    the occurrence of an Insolvency Event
with respect to the Issuer.

The Issuer shall promptly (but in any event not later than five
(5) Business Days) deliver to the Indenture Trustee written
notice in the form of an Officer’s Certificate of any event
that with the giving of notice and the lapse of time would become
an Event of Default under clause (c) above, its status and
what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.

Section 5.02     Acceleration of
Maturity; Rescission and Annulment .

(a)     If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(d)), the Indenture Trustee in its
discretion may, or if so requested in writing by the Noteholders
representing a majority of the Note Balance of the Outstanding
Notes of the Controlling Class, shall, declare by written notice to
the Issuer all of the Notes to be immediately due and payable, and
upon any such declaration (but subject to clause (b) below)
the entire outstanding Note Balance, together with accrued interest
thereon through the date of acceleration, shall become immediately
due and payable as provided in the Notes. If following the
occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(d)), the Indenture Trustee has not
declared the Notes to be immediately due and payable, the Issuer
shall continue to pay interest and principal on the Notes on each
Payment Date in accordance with Section 5.04 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, until the Notes are accelerated or until a
liquidation, if any, of the Trust Estate. If an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(d) shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Notes shall automatically become immediately due
and payable without any further action on the part of any
Person.

(b)     At any time after declaration of
acceleration of maturity has been made pursuant to clause (a)
above and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due
has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee as provided hereinafter
in this Article V, the Noteholders representing a majority of
the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class
may, by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
rescind such declaration and annul such consequences if:

(i)     the Issuer has paid or deposited with
the Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

(A)     all payments of principal of and
interest on all Notes and all other amounts that would then be due
hereunder or upon such Notes if the Event of Default giving rise to
such acceleration had not occurred; and

(B)     all sums paid by the Indenture Trustee
hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses and
disbursements of the Indenture Trustee
 
22



and its agents and counsel and the reasonable compensation,
expenses and disbursements of the Indenture Trustee and its agents
and counsel.

(ii)     all Events of Default, other than the
nonpayment of the principal of the Notes that has become due solely
by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in
Section 5.12.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair
any right consequent thereto.

Section 5.03     Collection of
Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Indenture Trustee;
Authority of the Controlling Class .

(a)    The Issuer covenants that if (i) a
default is made in the payment of any interest on any Note when the
same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a
period of five (5) days, or (ii) a default is made in the
payment of the principal of or any installment of the principal of
any Note on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date, the Issuer
will, upon demand of the Noteholders representing a majority of the
Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class, pay
to the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders, the
entire amount then due and payable on such Notes in respect of
principal and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and,
to the extent payment at such rate of interest shall be legally
enforceable, on overdue installments of interest at the Interest
Rates then applicable to the Notes and, in addition thereto, such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses and disbursements of the Indenture Trustee and its agents
and counsel.

(b)    In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith
to pay such amounts upon such demand or if any such amounts became
due and payable automatically pursuant to the terms of
Section 5.02(a), the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as
trustee of an express trust, may (and at the written direction of
the Noteholders representing a majority of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class shall) institute a
Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and
may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may
enforce the same against the Issuer or other obligor on such Notes
and collect in the manner provided by law out of the Collateral or
the property of any other obligor on such Notes, wherever situated,
the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.

(c)    If an Event of Default occurs, the
Indenture Trustee may, as more particularly provided in
Section 5.04, in its discretion, or shall at the written
direction of the Noteholders representing a majority of the Note
Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class, proceed
to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee at the written direction of the
Noteholders representing a majority of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class shall reasonably deem
most effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or
to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable right
vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

taken possession of the Issuer or its property or CRB or its
property or such other obligor or Person, or in case of any other
comparable Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor on
the Notes or CRB, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or
such other obligor or CRB, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of

Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result

official in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of
such Noteholders to make payments to the Indenture Trustee for
application in accordance with Section 5.04 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and, in the event that the Indenture Trustee
shall consent to the making of payments directly to such
Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall

Holders of the Notes.

by the Indenture Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be
held to represent all of the Holders of the Notes, and it shall not
be necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such
Proceedings.

Section 5.04   Remedies; Priorities .

(a)      If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and at
the written direction of the Noteholders representing a majority of
the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class
shall, do one or more of the following (subject to Sections 5.02
and 5.05):

(i)      institute Proceedings in its
own name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of
all amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained and collect from the Issuer and any other obligor
on such Notes moneys adjudged due;

(ii)      institute Proceedings from
time to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this
Indenture with respect to the Collateral;

Trustee and the Holders of the Notes; and

(iv)      sell the Collateral or any
portion thereof or rights or interest therein, at one or more
public or private sales called and conducted in any manner
permitted by law; provided, however, notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or
otherwise liquidate the Collateral following an Event of Default,
other than an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(a) or
(b), unless, (x) the Noteholders representing 100% of the Note
Balance of the Outstanding Notes voting as a single class consents
thereto, (y) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation
distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in
full all amounts then due and unpaid on such Notes in respect of
principal and interest, or (z) the Indenture Trustee
determines
 
25



that the Collateral will not continue to provide sufficient funds
for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they

payable, and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of the
Noteholders representing 66 2 / 3 % of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes voting as a single class; provided ,
further , that the Depositor or its Affiliates may not

the Issuer’s expense whether or not the Collateral is sold
(unless it is paid in the priority set forth in
Section 5.04(b) in connection with a sale of Collateral) but
need not, obtain and conclusively rely upon an opinion of an
Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national
reputation as to the sufficiency of the Collateral for such
purpose.

(b)      If the Indenture Trustee
collects any money or property pursuant to this Article V and
the Notes have been accelerated, it shall pay out such money or
property (and other amounts, including all amounts held on deposit
in the Reserve Account) held as Collateral for the benefit of the
Noteholders (net of liquidation costs associated with the sale of
the Collateral) in the following order of priority:

  (i)      first, to the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Administrator, any
accrued and unpaid fees, indemnity payments and reasonable expenses
permitted under the Basic Documents;

the Servicing Fee and all unpaid Servicing Fees and to the Backup

Holders of the Class A-1 Notes, the Holders of the
Class A-2 Notes, the Holders of the Class A-3 Notes and
the Holders of the Class A-4 Notes, the Accrued Class A-1
Note Interest, the Accrued Class A-2 Note Interest, the
Accrued Class A-3 Note Interest and the Accrued Class A-4
Note Interest, respectively;

(iv)      fourth, if (x) the
Receivables have been sold after an Event of Default has occurred
or (y) an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(a),
(b) or (d) has occurred, in the following order of
priority:

(A)      to the Holders of the
Class A-1 Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class A-1 Notes have been Paid In Full;

(B)      pro rata, to the Holders of
the Class A-2 Notes, the Holders of the Class A-3 Notes
and the Holders of the Class A-4 Notes, in respect of
principal thereon, until the Class A-2 Notes, the
Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes have been Paid In
Full;

(C)      to the Holders of the
Class B Notes, the Accrued Class B Note Interest;

Class C Notes, the Accrued Class C Note Interest;

(F)      to the Holders of the
Class C Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class C Notes have been Paid In Full;

(v)      fifth, if an Event of
Default other than that described in clause (iv) directly

such Event of Default has occurred, in the following order of
priority:

Class B Notes, the Accrued Class B Note Interest;

(B)      to the Holders of the
Class C Notes, the Accrued Class C Note Interest;

the Class A-2 Notes, the Holders of the Class A-3 Notes

principal thereon, until the Class A-2 Notes, the
Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes have been Paid In
Full;

(E)      to the Holders of the
Class B Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class B Notes have been Paid In Full;

(F)      to the Holders of the
Class C Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class C Notes have been Paid In Full;

(vi)      sixth, any remaining funds
shall be distributed to the Certificateholders.

(c)      The Indenture Trustee may
fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders
pursuant to this Section 5.04. At least fifteen (15) days
before such record date, the Issuer shall mail to each Noteholder
and the Indenture Trustee a notice that states the record date, the
payment date and the amount to be paid.

Section 5.05   Optional Preservation of the
Collateral .  If the Notes have been declared to be
due and payable under Section 5.02 following an Event of
Default, and such declaration and its consequences have not been
rescinded and annulled, the Indenture Trustee may (and if
instructed in writing by the Noteholders representing a majority of
the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class
shall), elect to maintain possession of the Collateral. It is the
desire of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be at
all times sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such
desire into account when determining whether or not to maintain
possession of the
 
27


Collateral. In
determining whether or not to maintain possession of the
Collateral, the Indenture Trustee may (and if instructed in writing
by the Noteholders representing a majority of the Note Balance of
the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class shall), obtain (and
may conclusively rely upon) an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Collateral for such purpose. Such opinion shall be at the
expense of the Issuer regardless of whether or not the Collateral
is sold unless it is paid in the priority set forth in
Section 5.04(b)(i) in connection with a sale of
Collateral.

Section 5.06   Limitation of Suits .

(a)      No Noteholder shall have any
right to institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with
respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

(i)      such Holder has previously
given written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a continuing Event
of Default;

(ii)      the Holders of not less
than 25% of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes have made
written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute such
Proceeding in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
Indenture Trustee hereunder;

(iii)      such Holder or Holders
have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity
satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities that
may be incurred in complying with such request;

(iv)      the Indenture Trustee for
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice, request and
offer of indemnity has failed to institute such Proceedings;
and

(v)      no direction inconsistent
with such written request has been given to the Indenture Trustee
during such thirty (30) day period by Noteholders representing
a majority of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the
Controlling Class.

(b)      It is understood and
intended that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in
any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any
provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other Noteholders or to obtain or to seek to obtain
priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any
right under this Indenture, except as set forth herein.

(c)      In the event the Indenture
Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and
indemnity from two or more groups of Noteholders pursuant to this
Section 5.06, each representing less than a majority of the
Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class of
Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall only act at the written
direction of the Noteholders representing a majority of the Note
Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class.

Section 5.07   Unconditional Rights of
Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest . Notwithstanding
any other provisions in this Indenture, each Noteholder shall have
the right,
 
28


which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest,
if any, on such Note on or after the respective due dates thereof
expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not
be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

Section 5.08   Restoration of Rights and
Remedies .  If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and
in every such case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

Section 5.09   Rights and Remedies Cumulative
.  No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be cumulative and
in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment
of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 5.10   Delay or Omission Not a Waiver
.  No delay or omission of the Indenture Trustee, or any
Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any
Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy
or constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article V or by Applicable Law to the Indenture Trustee or to
the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

Section 5.11   Control by Controlling Class
.  The Holders of a majority of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class shall have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for
any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the
Notes or this Agreement or exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Indenture Trustee hereunder or under the Notes or any other
Basic Document; provided, however, that (i) such direction
shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this
Indenture, (ii) the Indenture Trustee may take any other
action reasonably deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee that is
not inconsistent with such direction, (iii) subject to the
terms of Section 5.04, any direction to the Indenture Trustee
to sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be by Holders of Notes
evidencing not less than 100% of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes and (iv) if the conditions set forth in
Section 5.05 have been satisfied and the Indenture Trustee
elects to retain the Collateral pursuant to such Section, then any
direction to the Indenture Trustee by the Holders of Notes
evidencing less than 100% of the Note Balance of the Outstanding
Notes to sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be of no force and
effect. Notwithstanding the rights of Noteholders set forth in this
Section 5.11, subject to Section 6.01, the Indenture
Trustee need not take any action that it reasonably determines
might involve it in
 
29


liability (unless it is
offered a reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it) or might
materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders not
consenting to such action.

Section 5.12   Waiver of Past Defaults
.  Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes as provided in Section 5.02, the
Noteholders representing a majority of the Note Balance of the
Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class may waive any past
Default or Event of Default and its consequences except a Default
(i) in payment of principal of or interest on any of the Notes
or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that
cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Note. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to
their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event of Default shall cease
to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred,
and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have
been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereto.

Section 5.13   Undertaking for Costs
.  All parties to this Indenture agree, and each
Noteholder by such Holder’s acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee
for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may
in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, against any party litigant in such suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or
defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this
Section 5.13 shall not apply to any suit instituted by
(i) the Indenture Trustee, (ii) any Noteholder, or group
of Noteholders, in each case holding in the aggregate more than 50%
of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes, or (iii) any
Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or
interest on any Note on or after the respective due dates expressed
in such Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption,
on or after the Redemption Date).

Section 5.14   Waiver of Stay or Extension
Laws .  The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it
may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or
plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at
any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that
it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the
Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 5.15   Action on Notes
.  The Indenture Trustee’s right to seek and
recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be
affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other
relief under or with respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of
this Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee
or the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any
judgment by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the
 
30


levy of any execution
under such judgment upon any portion of the Collateral or upon any
of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or property collected by the
Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance with
Section 5.04(b).

Section 5.16   Performance and Enforcement of
Certain Obligations .

(a)      Promptly following a request
from the Indenture Trustee (which request the Indenture Trustee
shall make if instructed in writing to do so by the Noteholders
representing a majority of the Note Balance of the Outstanding
Notes of the Controlling Class) to do so and at the
Administrator’s expense, the Issuer shall take all such
lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to compel or
secure the performance and observance by CRB of each of its
obligations to the Issuer under or in connection with the Basic
Documents and to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and
privileges lawfully available to the Issuer under or in connection
with the Basic Documents to the extent and in the manner directed
by the Indenture Trustee, including the transmission of notices of
default on the part of CRB or the Depositor thereunder and the
institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to
compel or secure performance by CRB or the Depositor of its
obligations under the Basic Documents; provided, however, nothing
herein shall in any way impose on the Indenture Trustee the duty to
monitor the performance of CRB of any of its liabilities, duties or
obligations under any Basic Documents or to compel CRB to so
perform and the Indenture Trustee shall have no liability for
failing to do so.

(b)      If an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and, subject
to the requirements of the last sentence of Section 5.11, at
the direction (which direction shall be in writing or by telephone
(confirmed in writing promptly thereafter)) of Holders of Notes
evidencing not less than 66  2 ⁄ 3
% of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling
Class shall, exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and
claims of the Issuer against the Depositor, the Seller or the
Servicer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing
Agreement or against the Seller under or in connection with the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, including the right or power to
take any action to compel or secure performance or observance by
the Depositor, the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, of
its obligations to the Issuer thereunder and to give any consent,
request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver under the
Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
as the case may be, and any right of the Issuer to take such action
shall be suspended.

(c)      If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, and,
subject to the requirements of the last sentence of
Section 5.11, at the direction (which direction shall be in
writing or by telephone (confirmed in writing promptly thereafter))
of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 66
 2 ⁄ 3 % of the Note Balance of
the Outstanding Notes of the Controlling Class shall, exercise all
rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Depositor
against the Seller under or in connection with the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, including the right or power to take any action
to compel or secure performance or observance by the Seller of its
obligations to the Depositor thereunder and to give any consent,
request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver under the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, and any right of the Depositor to
take such action shall be suspended.

.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
of which a Trust Officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual
knowledge, the Indenture Trustee shall exercise the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person’s own affairs.

(a)      Except during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Indenture Trustee
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants
or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the
Indenture Trustee; and in the absence of bad faith or negligence on
its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions
expressed therein, upon the face value of the certificates,
reports, resolutions, documents, orders, opinions or other
instruments furnished to the Indenture Trustee provided under this
Indenture and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee shall not be
responsible for the accuracy or content of any such resolution,
certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or other
instrument; however, the Indenture Trustee shall examine any
Officer’s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel issued pursuant
to the provisions of this Indenture to determine whether or not
they conform to the requirements of this Indenture; if any such
instrument is found not to conform in any material respect to the
requirements of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall notify
the Noteholders of such instrument in the event that the Indenture
Trustee, after so requesting, does not receive a satisfactorily
corrected instrument.

(b)      The Indenture Trustee may
not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its
own negligent failure to act, its own bad faith or its own willful
misconduct, except that:

  (i)      this paragraph
does not limit the effect of Section 6.01(a);

  (ii)      the Indenture
Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good
faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Indenture
Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(iii)      the Indenture Trustee
shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture or any other Basic
Document.

(c)      The Indenture Trustee shall
not be liable for indebtedness evidenced by or arising under any of
the Basic Documents, including principal of or interest on the
Notes, or interest on any money received by it except as the
Indenture Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuer.
 
32



(d)      Money held in trust by the
Indenture Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by Applicable Law or the terms of this
Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

Indenture shall require the Indenture Trustee to advance, expend or
