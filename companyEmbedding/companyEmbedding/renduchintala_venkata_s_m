Intel just hired a Qualcomm bigwig to help expand beyond the ailing PC market

  Dr. Venkata “Murthy” Renduchintala, the former co-president of
  Qualcomm's main chip unit, 
  just left the company to join rival chipmaker Intel.

At Intel, Renduchintala will be the president of
  the Client and Internet of Things (IoT) Businesses and
  Systems Architecture Group, a newly created unit that
  combines a lot of units: Platform Engineering, Client
  Computing, IoT, Software and Services, and Design &
  Technology Solutions groups.

It's worth noting the Client Computing Group, which
  includes both the PC and mobile chips, and is Intel's largest
  revenue generator, is also looped under this group.

Intel has historically made most of its money by providing
  chips for PCs, but with the shrinking PC market, it's been
  struggling to grow that part of the business. Instead, it's been
  focusing on data center chips and IoT chips to drive
  growth.

The announcement 
  was made just a day after Qualcomm promoted the other
  co-president Cristiano Amon as its
  executive VP, while making Renduchintala's departure
  official for the first time.





According to Qualcomm, the move wasn't a
  sudden departure at all. In a statement sent to Business Insider,
   it said Renduchintala was given a few months to
  consider his next move. Here's what Qualcomm said:

"A few months ago we made the decision to
  move away from a co-president leadership structure for QCT. 
   Cristiano Amon was the clear choice as President of the
  chipset business. We made the decision to enhance the operation
  of QCT by having a single decision maker who has an exceptional
  track record of executing and has the confidence of the team and
  our customers.  We are confident in Cristiano's leadership
  as we capitalize on the opportunities ahead.   Murthy
  was offered another role within Qualcomm, but he chose to leave
  the company instead."

Still, the announcement drew some
  question marks, considering Renduchintala's
  contribution to Qualcomm over tha last 10 years. He's considered
  to be one of the biggest names in the industry, having led
  Qualcomm's CDMA Technologies unit, but Qualcomm didn't
  have any mention of his work in yesterday's press
  release, only saying, "Murthy
  Renduchintala, who has served as QCT co-president
  for the past three years, will be leaving
  Qualcomm."

Intel Appoints Dr. Venkata ‘Murthy’ Renduchintala President, Client 
      and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group






November 20, 2015 02:15 PM Eastern Standard Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intel Corporation today announced the appointment of Dr. Venkata 
      “Murthy” Renduchintala as president of a newly created Client and 
      Internet of Things (IoT) Businesses and Systems Architecture Group. 
      Renduchintala has also been appointed as an executive officer of Intel 
      Corporation.
    


      “Intel’s strategy and direction is solid, and we continue to evolve our 
      organizational structure to better position the company for growth,” 
      said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “The caliber of leadership and 
      experience Murthy brings to our executive team represents a significant 
      move toward delivering the benefits of our strategy even faster than 
      before.”
    

      Renduchintala brings to Intel a unique blend of technical, operations, 
      business and customer relationship-building skills, as well as extensive 
      expertise from his long career in the system-on-chip (SoC), mobile and 
      IoT areas. Under his leadership, the company will align product design, 
      engineering and business direction to tighten Intel’s strategy and speed 
      execution across the communications, device and IoT segments, which are 
      all core to growth in the smart and connected compute era. The new 
      organization brings together Intel’s Platform Engineering, Client 
      Computing, IoT, Software and Services, and Design & Technology Solutions 
      groups, which share a common set of technologies required for mobile SoC 
      and connectivity leadership.
    

      “The largest semiconductor company in the world, Intel is a technology 
      and business icon for which I have deep respect, and I am honored to 
      join its ranks,” said Renduchintala. “Bringing together the formidable 
      talent into this new organization will enable Intel to accelerate 
      progress in segments already at significant scale and with continued 
      strong prospects for growth.”
    

      Renduchintala, 50, joins Intel from Qualcomm Inc., where he most 
      recently served as executive vice president of Qualcomm Technologies 
      Inc. and co-president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT). In this role, 
      he was responsible for leading Qualcomm’s semiconductor business in the 
      computing, mobile and adjacent segments.

Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala


Dr. Venkata (Murthy) M. Renduchintala is group president of the Client and Internet of Things (IoT) Businesses and Systems Architecture and chief engineering officer at Intel Corporation. The group is responsible for aligning technology, engineering, product design and business direction to extend Intel’s strategy and speed execution across the client device and IoT segments — all core to growth in the smart and connected compute era. Renduchintala’s group brings together Intel’s Platform Engineering, Client Computing, IoT, Software and Services, and Design and Technology Solutions as they share a common set of technologies required for client/mobile System on Chip (SoC) and connectivity leadership.
Renduchintala has spent a substantial part of his career in the SoC, mobile and IoT areas. Prior to joining Intel, he was executive vice president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc. and co-president of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, where he led its semiconductor business in the computing and mobile segments. He joined Qualcomm in 2004 from Skyworks Solutions Inc./Conexant Systems Inc., where he was vice president and general manager of the company’s Cellular Systems Division. Prior to Skyworks, he spent a decade with Philips Electronics, where he progressed to become vice president of engineering for its consumer communications business.
Renduchintala holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, a master’s degree in business administration and a Ph.D. in digital communications from the University of Bradford in England.
