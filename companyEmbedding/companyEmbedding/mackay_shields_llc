	prevail.  An application for interests in any of the Funds should only be made having fully and carefully read the relevant prospectus, the latest financial reports 
	and other offering documents for the relevant Fund.

OUR HISTORY
MacKay Shields’ history dates back to 1938, when we were founded as an economic consulting firm by Gilbert MacKay. As a registered investment adviser since 1969, the firm has been an adopter of new ideas in unsettled markets. This has been demonstrated by the firm’s ability to react to market changes through ongoing product evolution, enabling us to now offer clients a broad array of income-oriented investment strategies across the fixed income spectrum.
Over the years, MacKay Shields has emerged as a growing player in the investment management business with a commitment to partnering with our clients to deliver tailored income-oriented investment solutions based on their goals and objectives. Our ability to adapt manager skill and strategies, as well as strategies that utilize asset allocation, is what separates us from others.

MacKay Shields

Philosophy
MacKay Shields believes solid performance is the result of both a consistent investment process and the interaction of its focused portfolio management teams. The firm offers a diverse roster of actively managed styles, and its investment teams cover the core fixed-income, high-yield, global and emerging markets, investment-grade, municipal, and convertible mandates. Each portfolio management team makes, and is completely accountable for, all decisions about security selection, weightings, and sector allocation. The teams regularly monitor adherence to investment strategy and guidelines, which ensures consistent and equal treatment for all portfolios with similar objectives.
Process
Each of our investment strategies is managed by a veteran team of portfolio managers and analysts. Across market cycles, these teams have delivered solid investment returns through unique investment insights driven by bottom-up, credit-centric fundamental research, coupled with top-down macroeconomic analysis in certain strategies.
History
MacKay Shields’ history dates back to 1938, when we were founded as an economic consulting firm by Gilbert MacKay. As a registered investment advisor since 1969, the firm has been an adopter of new ideas in unsettled markets. This has been demonstrated by the firm’s ability to react to market changes through ongoing product evolution, enabling us to now offer clients a broad array of income-oriented investment strategies across the fixed-income spectrum.
Over the years, MacKay Shields has emerged as a growing player in the investment management business with a commitment to partnering with our clients to deliver tailored income-oriented investment solutions based on their goals and objectives. Our ability to adapt manager skill and strategies, as well as strategies that utilize asset allocation, is what separates us from others. We have the experience and history to demonstrate our long-term commitment to our investment approach, our clients and their portfolios, and our business.
Our rich history as an investment manager was recognized by New York Life Insurance Company, which acquired our firm in 1984. MacKay Shields operates and invests independently, which allows us to honor our core principles of maintaining a long-term perspective on the markets and what we believe is right for our clients.

MacKay Shields Expands Defined Contribution Capabilities with 
      Introduction of Two Collective Investment Trusts




Plan Sponsors to Access Award Winning MacKay Shields Strategies via 
      Convenient Collective Investment Trust Structure


Firm Introduces Unconstrained Bond and Core Plus Bond Collective 
      Investment Trusts






October 28, 2014 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MacKay Shields LLC (“MacKay”), a global, multi-product fixed income 
      investment manager, announced that it will act as advisor to two SEI 
      Trust Company sponsored collective investment trusts (“CITs”), 
      implementing MacKay’s Core Plus Bond and Unconstrained Bond strategies. 
      This launch marks MacKay’s expansion in the U.S. retirement market and 
      delivers new investment opportunities for plan sponsors. The SEI Trust 
      Company is a subsidiary of SEI (NASDAQ:SEIC), a leading global provider 
      of investment operations solutions, investment processing and investment 
      management.
    


      “Collective investment trusts have emerged as a key vehicle for plan 
      sponsors moving from the defined benefit to the defined contribution 
      model,” said John Akkerman, MacKay’s Global Head of Distribution. “We at 
      MacKay Shields are committed to meeting institutional investors’ needs 
      as the retirement market continues to evolve, and we believe that 
      collective investment trusts implementing our established fixed income 
      strategies will create new opportunities for plan sponsors as they 
      continue to adopt the defined contribution model.”
    

      “The decoupling in the recoveries of the US and UK versus Continental 
      Europe and Japan has presented significant opportunities in the global 
      bond markets,” said Dan Roberts, Executive Managing Director and Head of 
      Global Fixed Income at MacKay. “Against this backdrop, we believe that 
      our Core Plus and Unconstrained Bond strategies are well-positioned to 
      deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to both retail and 
      institutional investors.”
    

      “We have successfully partnered with quality managers for over 25 years, 
      and MacKay Shields is a great example of a successful global manager 
      that understands there is no one-size-fits-all product structure for 
      their strategies,” said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President, SEI’s 
      Investment Manager Services division. “We are pleased to add MacKay 
      Shields as a Collective Investment Trust manager in our world class 
      Collective Investment Trust offering.”
    

      The MacKay Shields Core Plus Bond CIT aims to deliver returns by 
      opportunistically identifying investments in global developed and 
      emerging markets as well as high yield debt securities. The MacKay 
      Shields Unconstrained Bond CIT employs a flexible investment process 
      that allocates investments across the global fixed income markets. 
      MacKay Shields has been managing these strategies via ‘40 Act funds and 
      separate accounts since 1999 (Core Plus Bond) and 2009 (Unconstrained 
      Bond).
    

      Dan Roberts, Head of Global Fixed Income and Chief Investment Officer 
      leads the portfolio management team that will advise the new CITs. SEI 
      Trust Company serves as the CITs’ trustee and investment manager. Both 
      strategies are available to all tax-qualified retirement plans..

Before you invest
All investments are subject to market risk and will fluctuate in value. 
A portion of a municipal fund’s income may be subject to state and local taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest-rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk, in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner. High-yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher-quality debt securities and may be subject to greater price volatility. High-yield municipal bonds may be subject to increased liquidity risk as compared to other high-yield debt securities.
Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of information about certain issuers, and the possibility of future tax and legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Such uncertainties could cause increased volatility in the municipal securities market and could negatively impact the Fund's net asset value and/or the distributions paid by the Fund. Securities purchased by the Fund that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions, or investor perceptions.
Active management is the use of a human element, such as a single manager, co-managers or a team of managers, to actively manage a fund’s portfolio. Active management strategies typically have higher fees then passive management.
P3s are Public-Private Partnerships, which are a popular infrastructure financing structure outside of the U.S. Pari passu: At the same rate or on equal footing.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
