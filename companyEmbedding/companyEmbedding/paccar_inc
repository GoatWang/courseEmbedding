Environmental Leadership
Environmental leadership is one of PACCAR’s core values. Reducing the environmental impact of our activities is an integral part of the process of continuous improvement. Our commitment to the environment is demonstrated in our energy efficient operations and technologically advanced products and recognized in the communities in which we live and work around the world.
Eco-Efficiency
PACCAR is committed to reduce its environmental footprint in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG),water consumption and waste.


     
Energy
Reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission intensity in manufacturing operations.
Water
Reduce water consumption.
Waste
Reduce waste.
Products
Continual reduction in environmental impact and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.



Investing in Sustainable Operations

Finding ways to reduce waste, reuse materials, conserve energy and reduce the environmental impact of Company activities occurs daily in both small and significant ways across the Company. PACCAR is driving clean manufacturing into every aspect of its business not only because it is the right thing to do but because it makes good long-term business sense.
All Company manufacturing locations that have been in operation for more than two years have achieved ISO14001 certification.
The Company has invested $160 million over the past ten years in facility projects that have improved energy efficiency, reduced emissions, reduced water consumption and waste including $35 million in reusable containers. PACCAR’s environmental leadership is demonstrated by being the first in the truck industry to implement chassis robotic paint systems. This process has enhanced paint quality, reduced cost and decreased paint usage, waste and air emissions.



PACCAR’s DAF Leyland assembly plant in the United Kingdom was the first in the world to robotically paint truck chassis on a moving assembly line reducing paint per chassis by six percent.


Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
From 2009 to 2016 PACCAR reduced greenhouse gas emissions 32% on a per revenue basis as shown below. Hazardous air emissions have been reduced by over 200 metric tonnes per year in paint and other processes. PACCAR’s goal is a continual reduction of its environmental footprint including a reduction of greenhouse gas emission.

PACCAR joined the CDP Reporter Services for reporting greenhouse gas emissions and to benchmark performance to continue reducing our greenhouse gas footprint.

 


Reducing Waste
Many of the Company’s manufacturing locations achieve “zero waste to landfill” by recycling, employing reusable containers and composting food and paper waste. Kenworth’s Renton, Washington plant received the 2013 Best Workplace for Waste Prevention and Recycling Award for the fifth consecutive year from the King County, Washington Solid Waste Division.
Conserving Resources

Company facilities employ a variety of energy conservation actions. We reduce the use of water through internal recycling, reduce paint waste through robotic paint systems and conserve energy by using new technologies such regenerative dynamometers that capture electricity from vehicle testing. Motion-sensing light fixtures were recently installed in the expanded distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The fixtures work in conjunction with daylight harvesting to reduce electricity usage by a projected 40%.
Kenworth Australia projected a reduction in its CO² output by 28 metric tonnes per year by replacing its fixtures with LED lighting systems.


Six Sigma Environmental Award

The Company chairman rewards projects designed to reduce the Company’s impact on the environment by presenting an annual Six Sigma award to the team project that contributes the most to improve eco-efficiency.
The 2013 Six Sigma Environmental Award was earned by the DAF cab plant in Westerlo, Belgium for a project which is projected to reduce water consumption per cab 41%, enough to fill 18 Olympic size swimming pools.


Products
All PACCAR vehicles have near-zero emissions of NOx, a smog causing compound, and are compliant with all applicable standards including those by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Commission.
PACCAR’s commitment to making the highest quality, most sustainable vehicles begins with product design. PACCAR uses Ecodesign, a software tool, to reduce environmental impacts through product design. Through this process, engineers increase recyclability of our trucks, reduce air emissions, use lighter materials to reduce fuel consumption and use fewer hazardous materials.
Advanced Vehicle DevelopmentPACCAR’s focus on quality and sustainability is reflected in the new Kenworth T680, Peterbilt Model 579 and the DAF XF Euro 6.

The new Kenworth and Peterbilt products improve aerodynamic efficiencies up to 10% generating an annualized fuel savings of up to 950 gallons per vehicle in an over-the-road application and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by almost 10 metric tonnes per vehicle.
As part of a U.S. Dept. of Energy program, Peterbilt has partnered with several component suppliers to develop an advanced concept tractor/trailer “SuperTruck” capable of achieving ten mpg in real-condition testing compared with the industry-wide average of approximately six miles per gallon, a 65% improvement. Technologies from this project are being evaluated for their incorporation into future PACCAR products.

Hybrids, Alternative Fuel, & Emission Reduction TechnologiesPACCAR has been a market leader in manufacturing trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) since 1996 with over 35% U.S. market share. Natural gas engines reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20%.
Kenworth and Peterbilt also offer resource-conserving technologies like an electric hybrid drive system which can provide up to a 28% improvement in fuel economy, 28% emissions reduction and 50% reduction in brake wear.

The New York City parks department uses its fleet of Kenworth T370 hybrids to haul dirt to more than 500 ball fields throughout the city’s 1,700 parks resulting in a 30% improvement in fuel economy.



Fuel-Efficient, Low-Emission PACCAR Engines
PACCAR has strengthened its leadership in environmental stewardship by expanding its global portfolio of high performing low emission engines. Over the past five years, these engines have reduced GHG emissions by up to 14%. NOx and particulate matter have also been reduced by over 83%. Continued research and investments are expected to achieve further GHG reduction in the future.

Advanced combustion and aftertreatment research is conducted at PACCAR’s Engineering Centers located in Eindhoven, The Netherlands and Mount Vernon, Washington. These world-class facilities ensure all PACCAR MX-13 and MX-11 engines achieve the optimal combination of fuel-efficiency and emission reductions.

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company[6] and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world,[7][8] and has substantial manufacturing in light and medium vehicles through its various subsidiaries. For its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles that has led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies, PACCAR Inc was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2006.[9][10] The company’s presence has been especially strong in Renton, Washington, where it remains the oldest continually operating business. PACCAR's assembly plant in Renton was recognized as one of the best workplaces for commuters for the fifth consecutive year by the National Center for Transit Research in June 2013. The plant also celebrated its 20th anniversary in June 2013 and has produced more than 130,000 heavy-duty and medium-duty Kenworth trucks since it started its operations in 1993.[11][12][13]

History[edit]




Seattle Car and Foundry works at Renton, Washington, 1916.


PACCAR Inc started as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905 with a capitalization of $10,000 and was founded by William Pigott, Sr., its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders.[14] In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck.[15] The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many a Seattle landmark building.[16][17] In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.[18][19]
During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company's earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest.[20] During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.[21]
During World War II[edit]
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry’s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America’s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wingspans for B-17 bombers. During the spring of 1942 the company also built M4A1 Shermans tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 Tank Transporter, known as the Dragon Wagon, and the T28 Super Heavy Tank.[17] Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.[22]
Post war[edit]




PACCAR's History in the 1900s. Clockwise from top: Seattle Car Mfg in 1909, Pacific Car & Foundry's Railroad car in 1950, Kenworth T-10 truck and T28 Super Heavy Tank during WW 2


After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government’s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state.[17][23][24] In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation which was named after the stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington.. Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.[25]
In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as Pacific Car’s wholly owned subsidiary until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of Pacific Car and Foundry.[26][27][28] Pacific Car’s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle’s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City's World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building’s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.[15][29][30][31]
The 1970s to 1990s[edit]
Despite a serious slowdown due to National Recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980.[32][33] Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa.[34][35][36] PACCAR International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide.[37][38] PACCAR Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.[39][40] In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975,[41] was disbanded.[42] In 1983 the PACCAR Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded.[43] In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to PACCAR Defense Systems Division.[44] In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.[45][46]
In the mid 1980s, PACCAR's share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October.[47] PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market.[48][49] During the mid-80's PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable.[50][51] In 1987, PACCAR acquired Al’s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated which led to its entry into the automotive parts & accessories retail market that gave the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.[52][53][54]
The 1990s and beyond[edit]
PACCAR Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company’s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing.[55][56][57] In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR's Winch division was one of the world’s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.[58][59]
PACCAR International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington was opened on June 4, 1993.[60] In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR's presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997.[61] In 1996 & 1998 the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands and Leyland Trucks Ltd., an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. These acquisitions were funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997.[62][63][64][65] Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. Also, in 1998 PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in "big rig" truck production; behind Daimler AG in the US market. Other Major heavy-truck competitors include Navistar International and AB Volvo.[66][67][68][69]

MEMORANDUM
JAN E. DUBOIS, District Judge.
I. INTRODUCTION
This case involves the alleged infringement of three design patents for truck headlights owned by PACCAR, Inc. ("PACCAR") by aftermarket replacement headlights sold by Dorman Products, Inc. ("Dorman"). Presently before the Court is Dorman's Motion for Certification Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). For the reasons that follow, Dorman's Motion is denied.
II. BACKGROUND
The pertinent facts and procedural history are summarized as follows. In its Memorandum and Order dated August 22, 2016, the Court granted PACCAR's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Dorman's affirmative defense of invalidity of the three patents based on the on-sale bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) and denied Dorman's Motion for Summary Judgment on the same issue. See Dorman Products, Inc. v. PACCAR, Inc., ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2016 WL 4440322 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 23, 2016). That Memorandum contains additional factual background, procedural history, and details of the underlying patents in the case. Dorman filed this Motion for Certification Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) on September 1, 2016, seeking certification for interlocutory review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of this Court's Order of August 22, 2016. PACCAR filed its Response opposing certification on September 19, 2016.
A. The on-sale bar of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as clarified in Medicines, 827 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2016)
In concluding in its Memorandum dated August 22, 2016, that the on-sale bar did not apply to the three patents at issue in this case, this Court relied on the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in The Medicines Company v. Hospira, Inc., 827 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (en banc) ("Medicines"). The Medicines opinion clarified the first prong of the two-prong test for applicability of the on-sale bar: whether the claimed invention "was the subject of a commercial sale" before the critical date. Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1372 (citing Pfaff v. Wells, Inc., 525 U.S. 55, 67-68 (1998); see Pfaff, 525 U.S. at 67-68 ("[T]he on-sale bar applies when two conditions are satisfied before the critical date. First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale. . . . Second, the invention must be ready for patenting."). The Federal Circuit stated that "the transaction at issue must be a sale in a commercial law sense," and clarified that "the mere sale of manufacturing services by a contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented product for the inventor does not constitute a commercial sale of the invention." Id. at 1373 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Medicines "explain[ed] that commercial benefit—even to both parties in a transaction—is not enough to trigger the on-sale bar of § 102(b); the transaction must be one in which the product is `on-sale' in the sense that it is `commercially marketed.'" Id.
The Federal Circuit concluded that the sale at issue in Medicines was not a commercial sale because "(1) only manufacturing services were sold to the inventor—the invention was not; (2) the inventor maintained control of the invention, as shown by the retention of title to the embodiments and the absence of authorization to [the manufacturer] to sell the product to others; and (3) `stockpiling,' standing alone, does not trigger the on-sale bar.'" Id. at 1373-74. Additionally, the Federal Circuit stated that, while "not disqualifying in all instances," "the confidential nature of the transactions is a factor which weighs against the conclusion that the transactions were commercial in nature." Id. at 1376. While Medicines did not recognize a "blanket supplier exception," the Federal Circuit stated that "[t]he focus must be on the commercial character of the transaction, not solely on the identity of the participants." Id. at 1380.
B. This Court's Memorandum dated August 22, 2016
This Court relied on Medicines' clarification of the commercial limitation on Pfaff's first prong in concluding that the offers for sale in this case were not commercial transactions and thus did not trigger the on-sale bar. Dorman Products, 2016 WL 4440322, at *5-6. Specifically, this Court analyzed whether the nature of the two transactions at issue—price quotations from two headlight manufacturers—were commercial. With respect to one quotation, the Court concluded that while the quotation was an offer for sale because it would have created a binding contract upon acceptance, it was not commercial because "it was a transaction between the patentee . . . and a supplier," the terms were "consistent with a contract for manufacturing services, rather than the sale of a product at market value," "PACCAR retained title to the headlights," the manufacturer "was not free to market the headlights or the design of said to third parties," the offer was confidential, and "the headlights were not produced in commercial amounts until after the critical date." Id. at *5-6. With respect to the other quotation, the Court likewise concluded that it was an offer for sale, but that it was not commercial because PACCAR retained control of the invention and the manufacturer was "not free to market the headlights or claimed designs to third parties," the offer was confidential, the "quotation has other terms characteristic of a manufacturing contract . . . and was not a sale of a commercial embodiment of the patented design at full price," and "the headlights were not produced in commercial quantities until after the critical date." Id. at *6.
III. APPLICABLE LAW
A district court has discretion to certify an order that would otherwise not be appealable for interlocutory appeal when the district court is "of the opinion that such order [(1)] involves a controlling question of law as to which [(2)] there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and [(3)] that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the termination of the litigation." 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b); see Morgan v. Ford Motor Co., Civ. No. 06-1080, 2007 WL 269806, at *2 (D.N.J. Jan. 25, 2007) ("[E]ven if all three criteria . . . are met, the district court may still deny certification, as the decision is entirely within the district court's discretion.").
In order to certify an order under § 1292(b), the district court must conclude that all three requirements have been met. Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 754 (3d Cir. 1974) (citations omitted); see also Interwave Tech., Inc. v. Rockwell Automation, Inc., Civ. No. 05-0398, 2006 WL 401843, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 16, 2006) ("When there is no substantial ground for a difference of opinion, certification for appeal can be denied on this ground alone." (citation omitted)). The party moving for certification bears the burden of establishing that all three requirements of § 1292(b) have been met. Litgo N.J., Inc. v. Martin, Civ. No. 06-2891, 2011 WL 1134676, at *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 25, 2011) (citations omitted).
IV. DISCUSSION
The Court concludes that Dorman has not met its burden of showing that all three criteria for certification have been met. The Court's decision is based on the second criteria for certification, which requires that there be substantial grounds for difference of opinion on the issue presented. "Substantial grounds for difference of opinion exist where there is genuine doubt or conflicting precedent as to the correct legal standard." Hall v. Wyeth, Civ. No. 10-738, 2010 WL 4925258, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 2, 2010). "The clearest evidence of substantial grounds for difference of opinion is where there are conflicting interpretations from numerous courts." Knopnick v. Downey, 963 F.Supp.2d 378, 398 (M.D. Pa. 2013). While a lack of controlling authority on a specific issue may constitute substantial grounds, Hall, 2010 WL 49225258, at *2, it does not necessarily do so. Keystone Tobacco Co., Inc. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 217 F.R.D. 235, 239 (D.D.C. 2003) (citation omitted).
Dorman argues that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion with respect to "the correct interpretation and application" of the commercial requirement articulated in Medicines to offers for sale. Specifically, Dorman contends that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion because (1) no cases apply Medicines, the facts of which involved a sale, to circumstances involving offers for sale; (2) Medicines "is not squarely on point" for cases involving offers for sale, and (3) this Court's application of Medicines is inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's holding in Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. v. Sunbeam Products, 726 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2013), that there is no blanket supplier exception to the on-sale bar. Dorman Mem. Supp. Mot. 5-6. The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.
First, the lack of other cases applying Medicines to circumstances involving offers for sale does not support a conclusion that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion with respect to its application to offers for sale. The Medicines opinion is relatively recent—it was decided on July 11, 2016—and the lack of reliance on the Medicines opinion by other courts does not in and of itself create substantial grounds for a difference of opinion. See Ryan v. Flowserve Corp., 444 F.Supp.2d 718, 724 (N.D. Tex. 2006) ("[S]imply because a court is the first to rule on a question or counsel disagrees on applicable precedent does not qualify the issue as one over which there is substantial disagreement.") (citation omitted).
Second, Dorman's argument that Medicines is not "squarely on point" to cases involving offers for sale fails because the en banc Medicines opinion makes clear that the transaction at issue must be commercial in order for on-sale bar to apply. Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1373, 1378. The commercial requirement clarified by Medicines is not limited to sales; rather, the opinion discusses both sales and offers for sale in its clarification of Pfaff's first prong. See, e.g., Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1373 ("[A]s a general proposition, we will look to the Uniform Commercial Code to define whether . . . a communication or series of communications rises to the level of a commercial offer for sale."). The opinion reiterates that, "to be true to Pfaff when assessing prong one of § 102(b), [a court] must focus on those activities that would be understood to be commercial sales and offers for sale `in the commercial community.'" Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1373 (citing Group One, Ltd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 254 F.3d 1041, 1047) (Fed. Cir. 2001)) (emphasis added). While the Medicines opinion specifically clarifies that "the mere sale of manufacturing services by a contract manufacturer to an inventor to create embodiments of a patented product for the inventor does not constitute a `commercial sale' of the invention," it also states that "[i]t is well-settled that mere preparations for commercial sales are not themselves `commercial sales' or `commercial offers for sale' under the on-sale bar." Id. at 1373, 1377 (citation omitted).
Medicines thus articulates controlling law that is directly applicable to this case—in order to trigger the on-sale bar, "there must be a commercial sale or offer for sale," and there was none in this case. Id. at 1378. As required by Medicines, this Court examined the characteristics of the transactions in this case—offers for sale—to determine whether they were commercial and concluded that they were not.
Finally, this Court's Order of August 22, 2016, is not inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's holdings in Hamilton Beach and Medicines that there is no blanket supplier exception to the on-sale bar. Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1379-80. This Court did not rely on a blanket supplier exception in its Memorandum; instead, it did as the Medicines opinion instructed and focused on the "character of the transaction [and] not solely on the identity of the participants," and concluded that the offers for sale in this case were not commercial transactions. Medicines, 827 F.3d at 1380; see Dorman Products, 2016 WL 4440322, at *5. Furthermore, this Court reached a question that the Hamilton Beach decision did not—whether the transaction at issue was commercial in nature. Relying on the reasoning of Hamilton Beach, this Court found that the transactions at issue were sufficiently definite to constitute offers for sale. Id. at *5-6. However, unlike Hamilton Beach, the Court went on to analyze whether the offers for sale were commercial and concluded that, under Medicines, they were not. Id. Medicines distinguished Hamilton Beach on this point, stating that the inventor in Hamilton Beach only argued that the offer was insufficiently firm to constitute a commercial offer for sale and did not argue "that no commercial sale of the patented product would occur if the inventor purchased it from its supplier." Medicines, 827 F.2d at 1380.
The Court concludes that Dorman has not met its burden of showing that substantial grounds for difference of opinion exists with respect to the application of Medicines to situations involving offers for sale. Dorman's Motion for Certification Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) is denied on this ground alone. The Court thus does not address the remaining requirements for certification—whether the challenged ruling involves a controlling question of law or whether an immediate appeal would materially advance the termination of the litigation.
V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Dorman's Motion for Certification Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) is denied. An appropriate order follows.

Paccar's stock surges after UBS upgrades on bullish truck market view
Shares of Paccar Inc.  surged 4.4% in midday trade Tuesday, after UBS turned bullish on the truck and truck parts maker for the first time in nearly two years, on the belief that truck production will pick up over the next year, that the used truck market is stabilizing and freight activity is improving. Analyst Steven Fisher raised his rating to buy after being at neutral since October 2015, and raised his stock price target to $75, which is 16% above current levels, from $66. "We think the health of the used market is often a leading indicator for new production," Fisher wrote in a note to clients, and with volumes improving, "we think pricing is also stabilizing. Fisher said not only have Class 8 heavy truck orders been "very strong" so far in 2017, he doesn't believe large on-highway fleets have started spending broadly yet, leaving room for the market to run higher. The stock has gained 1.8% year to date, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has advanced 2.9% and the S&P 500  has climbed 8.7%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
