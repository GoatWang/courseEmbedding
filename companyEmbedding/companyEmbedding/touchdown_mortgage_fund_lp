Mutual funds 101
Whether you’re just considering investing or have already established a diversified portfolio, here’s some information about mutual funds you may find helpful.

 What is your investment risk tolerance?

One of the basic principals of investing is that the more money you want to make, the more risk you need to be willing to take. This is called the “risk/return trade-off”. What it means is that a mutual fund with a lot of growth potential is subject to the fluctuations in the market. So, someone with a high risk tolerance could stand to make or lose a lot of money, depending on the performance of their mutual fund investments.

The best way to understand the risk/return trade-off is to speak with a Mutual Funds Representative. They guide you through the Customer Investor Profile questionnaire that will help define your investing objectives and your tolerance to risk. Once they understand what you want from your mutual fund investments, they will be able to recommend a mutual fund or mutual fund portfolio that is suitable for your needs.

 What makes a portfolio low risk or high risk? 

The amount of risk associated with an investment portfolio is determined by the types of assets held. Risk can also be associated with the growth potential of a portfolio. 

For example in the graph above:


						Portfolio A is composed entirely of bonds, which over time experienced both a low annual return – or growth – and low risk.
							
This is because bonds represent funds borrowed by a company or government in exchange for a predetermined interest rate, and guaranteed return of the principal by the borrower.
There is very little risk involved, unless that company or government goes bankrupt. 



A stock is an individual share in a company. Stocks – also referred to as “equities” - are traded on exchanges all over the world, and therefore are subject to the dips and rises in the stock market.

Portfolio B is composed exclusively of equities, which over time experienced high risk and high growth.

When a mutual fund portfolio includes a mixture of stocks and bonds, you benefit from diversification across these two asset classes


						Portfolio C	is composed of 80% bonds and 20% equities. 
							
This portfolio actually experienced lower risk than Portfolio A (100% bonds) and had a higher return.





						Portfolio D split the portfolio, investing 50% in bonds and 50% in equities. 
						
While it experienced more risk than Portfolio A or C, it also got a much higher return as a result.



As you can see there are many options in how you can assemble your mutual fund portfolio. A Mutual Funds Representative with TD Investment Services Inc. will work with you to determine your investment goals and risk tolerance, and then recommend the most appropriate mix of assets for you.

 Why is a broad range of investments better?

Mutual funds spread your money out across many investment types. This investment strategy is called diversification.
Diversification helps you minimize your risk, because you aren’t putting all your eggs in one basket. You may also benefit from greater return potential.
So, with a mutual fund, your money is no longer dependent on the performance of a single investment, but instead is an average of the entire collection of investments. That way if one stock or bond – or other asset – in a mutual fund portfolio performs poorly, other well-performing holdings within the mutual fund’s portfolio, help offset any losses.
The same can be true when investing in more than one type of mutual fund to complete a well-balanced investment portfolio.
One of the best ways to diversify your portfolio is to invest among the three main asset classes:

Money market
Bonds
Equities

Since asset classes tend to move independently of one another, positive performance in one asset class can help offset negative performance in another.
For mutual fund investors, a diversified portfolio would include a combination of money market funds for safety; bond and mortgage funds for income; and equity mutual funds for potential dividend income and long-term capital growth.









 
					

Expand
Take advantage of global opportunities.

						Another important way to diversify your portfolio is by investing in different countries around the world. Often, certain areas of the global economy are performing better than others. In addition, there are industries that may be better represented in other part of the globe, then they are here at home. By spreading your investments throughout the world, you reduce your overall portfolio risk, while at the same time increasing your long-term growth potential.
						








 
					

Expand
 A long time horizon can reduce your risk.
Whether you are investing in a bond or equity, they are all subject to fluctuations in market value. Over longer periods of time, however, returns tend to average out and stabilize. Therefore, staying invested longer, helps to reduce your risk and improve your potential for higher returns.








 
					

Expand
 Benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

If you can contribute to your mutual fund on a regular basis, not only are you steadily growing your investment, you are saving money while doing so. If you set up a Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan you are investing a fixed amount to your fund at regular intervals.
This strategy, called dollar-cost averaging, lets you buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. While it doesn’t guarantee a profit, or help protect you against a loss, it can result in a lower average unit cost over time.
For example, let’s say you have $60 a month to invest in a particular fund that fluctuates in price.

						January price = $5.00 – You buy 12 units
						February price = $3.00 – You buy 20 units
						March price = $6.00 – You buy 10 units

					    
In three months, you have invested $180 and purchased 42 units, with an average cost per unit of only $4.29. 
Best of all, when you set up a TD Comfort Portfolio, a Portfolio Manager does all the work for you. So all you have to do is set up a Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan and enjoy the savings. 
In order to set up a Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan, you must meet a $2,000 initial purchase minimum.

The value of professional investment management
When you’re ready to move beyond savings accounts and Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), mutual funds can offer an easy way to tap into potentially greater returns and help you reach your longer-term savings goals, such as retirement. TD offers solutions for every investor type, whether you’re seeking security, income, growth or a balance of all three. And it takes only $100 to get started.




 


















 
		

What does it cost to invest?
Mutual fund costs are typically expressed as a Management Expense Ratio, or MER. The fund costs that make up the MER are not charged to investors directly. Rather, the MER is reflected in the net return of a fund.
MERs vary, depending on the type of fund and how actively managed it is. For example, index funds generally have very low MERs. That’s because they are passively managed — the fund manager simply matches a market index.
With actively managed funds, however, the fund manager buys and sells securities, seeking to outperform the index. Backed by a team of researchers and analysts, fund managers stay on top of market opportunities, looking for ways to maximize returns while mitigating risk and making investment decisions on behalf of all fund investors.



 
		





 
		

The value behind the MER
Most of the fees you pay are used to cover the cost of managing the fund. When you choose TD Mutual Funds, expertise is built right into every fund. You get:

Professional fund management. TD Mutual Funds are managed by TD Asset Management Inc., (TDAM), one of Canada’s largest fund managers.
A wide range of investment options. TD has a broad selection of funds to help meet the needs of all types of investors.
Stability. With a single investment decision, you can have instant diversification across sectors, investment types and geographic markets, which helps reduce risk.




 
		





 
		

Management Fee

The management fee has two parts:

Portfolio management fees, paid to the investment management firm. 
You can benefit from: 
Research, investment selection and professional management
Trailing commissions, paid to the mutual fund dealer servicing your account.
You can benefit from: 
Ongoing customer care, including advice and service. For more on trailing commissions, see below.





 
		

Operating Costs

Cover accounting, audit costs and record keeping.




 
		

Taxes — GST and QST or HST



 
			





 
		

What are trailing commissions and how do they work?
Trailing commissions are paid by the investment management firm (for TD Mutual Funds, this is TD Asset Management Inc.) to the mutual fund dealer that you bought from (TD Investment Services Inc.). These commissions cover the cost of servicing your account and the advice provided by Mutual Funds Representatives in TD Canada Trust branches and at the call centre.



 
		

You can benefit from:



 
		


Dealing with a licensed Mutual Funds Representative, who can explain your options and help you select the fund or funds that meet your current needs.

Confidence that your trades are being reviewed by a manager.













The convenience of purchasing when and how you want.

Help, when you need it, in-branch, over the phone or online.




 
			





 
			

Are there any sales charges or trading fees?
In addition to management fees, some — but not all — mutual funds charge sales commissions, or “loads.” Funds that don’t have these charges are called “no-load” funds. 
Mutual funds that do charge them fall into two categories. You may need to pay a front-end load (charged when you purchase the fund) or a back-end load (charged when you redeem, or sell back, the fund to the company you bought it from).
When you purchase TD Mutual Funds through a Mutual Funds Representative at TD Canada Trust, there are no loads — 100% of your investment goes to work for you right away. However, because mutual funds are typically used for long-term investing, you may be charged a short-term trading fee if you switch or redeem a fund within 7 days of purchasing it (30 days for index funds).

 Are mutual funds guaranteed?

Since mutual funds qualify as securities and not deposits, they are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
However, fund managers and the funds themselves operate under strict securities regulations. For example, mutual funds are owned by the unitholders (people who own the mutual fund) and are separate legal entities from the companies that operate them. Securities legislation also requires that mutual fund assets be held in trust by a custodian on behalf of unitholders.




 
					

Expand
What types of funds are available?

You can choose funds that invest in money market investments such as government issued treasury bills, income investments such as bonds, or equity investments such as stocks of corporations, both domestic and international.
Some funds are broadly diversified, while others target an asset class or a specific sector of the economy, such as international bonds or science and technology stocks. Others aim to replicate the performance of a well-known index, such as the S&P/TSX Composite Index in Canada or Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 in the United States.
While there are hundreds of choices, each mutual fund will fall into one of the three main asset classes: safety, income or growth. Or, you can choose a balanced fund which is actively managed to maintain a mix of various asset classes.

 How much do I need to start?

The minimum initial investment for TD Mutual Funds is $100 for a non-registered account and $100 for an RSP account. The minimum subsequent investment is $100 for both types of accounts.
A TD Mutual Funds Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan is a convenient and affordable way to build your savings. You can start with as little as $25 per fund per transaction and this amount can be automatically deducted from your bank account on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.
Transfers between TD Mutual Funds are free, however, a 2% early redemption fee is payable to all funds except money market funds if you transfer or sell units of these funds within 30 days (90 days for TD e-Series) of purchase. This fee is designed to protect unitholders from the costs associated with other investors moving quickly in and out of the Funds. 
Frequent trading can hurt a fund's performance by forcing the portfolio manager to keep more cash in the fund than would otherwise be needed or to sell investments at an inappropriate time. It may also increase a fund's transaction costs.




 
					

Expand
Where can I buy mutual funds?

Mutual funds are sold through registered Mutual Funds Representatives or other registered advisors with mutual fund or securities dealers associated with banks, trust companies and insurance companies in Canada.
At TD, you can purchase TD Mutual Funds through TD Investment Services Inc. by contacting a Mutual Funds Representative through EasyLine telephone services, EasyWeb Internet access or by visiting any any TD Canada Trust branch.You can also purchase TD Mutual Funds through TD Direct Investing and TD Wealth.

 What about taxes?

Net income and net realized capital gains earned by a mutual fund are generally passed on to investors in the form of distributions. The frequency of distributions will vary depending on the mutual fund but will generally be monthly, quarterly or annually. 
You can also earn a capital gain when you sell your mutual fund or switch from one mutual fund to another at a price higher than you paid.
The tax treatment of distributions received or capital gains realized will depend upon the type of account in which you hold the investment.
If you hold a mutual fund in a registered plan (such as an RSP, RIF, RESP or TFSA) distributions paid by a mutual fund and any capital gains realized are generally sheltered from tax. Any amount you withdraw from a registered plan (excluding a TFSA) is generally fully taxable. Amounts withdrawn from a TFSA are not taxable. 
If you hold a mutual fund in a non-registered account, distributions paid by the mutual fund are taxable whether they are received in cash or reinvested into the mutual fund. You will receive a T3 Supplementary/Relevé 16 tax slip which will tell you the amount and type of income to report on your tax return. You must also include in your taxable income any capital gains realized from selling or switching your mutual fund. It's up to you to calculate and report the capital gains you realize on your transactions. Although an official tax slip is not required, mutual fund companies are required to report all sales or switches to Canada Revenue Agency.




 
					

Expand
What is the difference between book value and average cost per unit?
Book value is the original cost of purchases and reinvested distributions minus the average cost of any redemptions. Average cost per unit is used to calculate any capital gains or losses you may earn when you sell or transfer units of a fund you hold in a non-registered account. The average cost per unit is the book value of your fund divided by the number of units you hold.



 
					

Expand
 What is the difference between global and international funds?
Technically speaking, there's a difference between a global fund and an international fund, from a North American perspective. A global fund may invest in all the markets of the world, including North America, whereas an international fund generally excludes North America.



 
					

Expand
 How do I compare different funds?

While past performance does not guarantee future growth, annualized returns for different periods (e.g. 1-year, 3-years, 5-years, 10 years) are often used to compare funds and the quality of their management. Most major daily newspapers publish mutual funds performance tables each month for periods ranging from one month to 10 years or more.
Comparing a fund with others in its peer group is a good way to evaluate past performance. Mutual fund tables make it easy by grouping similar funds together. The ability to consistently outperform its peers is one sign of a good-quality fund.
To make a fair comparison, it is important to recognize that all funds in one category are not the same. For example, some Canadian equity funds are managed conservatively, while others aggressively pursue growth. One fund manager may emphasize longer-term value, while another may actively trade investment positions at different times in the market cycle. If in doubt, find out from the fund company, the simplified prospectus or the fund facts sheet, what the fund's investment objectives are and how the fund is managed. While some performance numbers can be very attractive, you may discover that the fund's investments are too risky for you.

 How does TDAM discourage market timing?

While market timing is not illegal, our funds are designed for long-term mutual fund investors. TDAM started to charge an early redemption fee (ERF) for most TD Mutual Funds many years ago. This 2% fee is applied to investors that buy and sell units of the same fund within 30 or 90 days, thus discouraging for market timing. The amount charged by this process is paid to the fund to cover any costs or possible negative impact to the fund or its unitholders. In addition, we also retain the right to reject purchase orders from a unitholder who is conducting any activity considered detrimental to the funds or its unitholders.
At TD Mutual Funds we are committed to protecting the best interests of our unitholders. We strive to apply the highest standard of care and diligence, and we review our current policies and practices regularly to ensure they continue to protect you and the funds.
