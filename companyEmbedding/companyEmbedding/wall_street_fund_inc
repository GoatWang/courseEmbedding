Midday Update: Event Risk Leads to Defensive Tone on Wall Street


July 24, 2017, 12:58:02 PM EDT
By MT Newswires, MT Newswires

Event risk weighed on Wall Street Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 trading lower ahead of a deluge of Q2 earnings, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and a busy economic calendar that includes durable goods orders and Q2 gross domestic product. The Nasdaq was trading slightly higher ahead of results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) after the close. Adding to Monday's sour tone was a downward revision to U.S. growth from the International Monetary Fund as forecasts adjusted for uncertainty surrounding the fate of President Trump's pro-growth policies. The IMF forecast comes in the wake of persistent accusations that Trump advisors met with Russian officials to try and influence the 2016 presidential election. On Monday, Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner was meeting with lawmakers about his contacts with Russian officials. The downbeat tone on Wall Street comes despite a healthy rebound in oil futures after Saudi Arabia pledged reductions in exports, and Nigeria committed to production cuts. The result drove Brent crude oil futures more than 1% higher to $48.59 per barrel. Economic data was a mixed bag, contributing to the negative tone in equities. The purchasing manager's flash manufacturing index for July rose to a 4-month high of 53.2 from 52.0 in June, beating expectations to remain unchanged at 52.0. The comparable index for the services sector of the economy was unchanged at 54.2. But the housing market remained sluggish this summer as existing home sales were down 1.8% in June to its second-lowest seasonally-adjusted annual rate this year of 5.52 million, missing estimates of 5.580 million. European shares closed lower as a result of disappointing manufacturing data, and concerns about an investigation into allegations of a German "carmaker cartel." Last week, Germany's Der Spiegel reported that some of Germany's largest auto makers colluded to control prices and emission controls, driving down share prices of Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW. Crude oil was up $0.56 to $46.33 per barrel. Natural gas was down $0.07 to $2.89 per 1 million BTU. Gold was down $0.10 to $1.254.80 an ounce, while silver was down $0.02 to $16.43 an ounce. Copper was up $0.01 to $2.73 per pound. Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund was up 1.39% to $9.47 with the United States Natural Gas Fund was down 1.96% to $6.49. Amongst precious-metal funds, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was down 1.03% to 22.18 while SPDR Gold Shares were down 0.01% to $119.25. The iShares Silver Trust was down 0.22% to $15.56.

         Goldman's rotten trading quarter is a familiar smell on Wall Street Goldman's rotten trading quarter is a familiar smell on Wall Street        Reuters  REUTERS Thursday, July 20, 2017, 3:26 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          A Goldman Sachs sign is seen on at the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, January 18, 2012. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Reuters)            Reuters  REUTERS Thursday, July 20, 2017, 3:26 AM    By Olivia Oran (Reuters) - Big Wall Street banks have spent billions of dollars and untold man-hours in recent years transforming their trading desks from hedge-fund like operations trading on their own account into market-making businesses offering a price based on what customers want to buy or sell.  But the shift in business model, prompted by reforms following the 2008 financial crisis, has done little to shield banks from suffering big losses when markets move against them, traders and risk managers told Reuters this week. Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s  second-quarter results, which saw earnings rise to $3.95 per share from $3.72 in the same quarter last year, also included the worst commodities trading quarter in its history as a public company, prompting a 2.8 percent fall in the bank's stock in the last two days.  Bad inventory positions based on wrong expectations of customer demand were partly to blame, Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez said. In explaining the decline in trading revenue, Chavez compared the business to a store that needs to stock the right products on its shelves. It must also be able to absorb what clients are selling and create new products they might want, he said, calling risk management in trading an "art and science." Goldman is not alone. In recent years, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc , Barclays PLC  and Deutsche Bank AG  have all suffered losses from currency moves, interest rate positions, or misguided bond market bets.  "It's not always easy to find a ready buyer and seller of the exact same assets that you're looking for," said Clifford Rossi, a former risk manager at Citigroup. "There may be timing issues – it's like musical chairs and the market maker may end up holding whatever is left over." Under the so-called the Volcker rule, which was intended to limit proprietary trading, banks are now required to prove they are only holding enough inventory to meet "reasonably expected near-term demand." The rule was implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis, when Wall Street banks fueled problems in the mortgage market by making speculative bets with their own money.  But one of the Volcker rule's unintended consequences has been to drain liquidity in certain markets, which has made it more expensive and difficult for banks to source inventory for clients or manage their own risks. New rules defining the amounts of capital banks must hold have made it more expensive for them to hold certain types of assets, while a long period of low volatility in some markets has made it trickier to gauge when trading activity will suddenly rise.  Unexpected gains in the Swiss franc in early-2015 caused losses at Citigroup and Barclays, Reuters reported at the time.     Last quarter, Deutsche Bank lost $60 million on a wrong-way inflation bet, according to Bloomberg. JPMorgan lost billions of dollars on the notorious "London whale" trades related to credit default swaps in 2012. In late-2013, Goldman was burned by bad currency bets.  JUST A FLUKE? In trying to prevent those kinds of losses, banks have developed software algorithms to anticipate market directions, put technology in place so that traders cannot breach risk limits, hired more risk managers, and empowered them to question decisions of dealers. According to consulting firm Opimas, banks last year spent more than $100 billion globally on management and compliance systems and people. But ultimately, those investments may prove futile in situations like the one Goldman faced last quarter, when some commodity prices collapsed, volatility in other markets was historically low, and customer activity dropped off. The unexpected trends led the bank's own commodities research analysts to ask in a June 29 report, "How did we (and the markets) get it so wrong?" "Throwing more dollars and people on risk management doesn't necessarily mean there is less trading risk on Wall Street or that it is properly contained," said Mark Williams, a professor at Boston University's business school who focuses on risk management in banks. Goldman has long prided itself on the independence and power of its risk management staff, who are known for questioning high-flying traders without fear of retribution. That helped Goldman become one of the most profitable Wall Street banks, while avoiding many of the pitfalls that beset rivals in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis. In March, Goldman gave its risk management team even more prominence by moving it into an independent unit. Some bank analysts are willing to give Goldman a break, given its track record. "It's the nature of the business," said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski. "It becomes a problem if either it produces massive outsized losses that compromise capital ratios and imperil the company, or they make a habit out of it. It's too early to say this is a habit rather than a fluke."   (Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

THE WALL STREET FUND, INC.NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2003 

1.    Organization 
The Wall Street Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end diversified management investment company. The principal investment objective of the Fund is growth of capital. To achieve this objective the Fund normally invests in common stocks which, in the opinion of the investment advisor, offer prospects of sustained growth. 

2.    Significant Accounting Policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The presentation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

(a) Investment Valuation  Securities which are traded on a recognized stock exchange are valued at the last sale price on the securities exchange on which such securities are primarily traded. Securities traded on the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which there were no transactions are valued at the mean between the closing bid and asked prices. Debt instruments maturing within 60 days are valued by the amortized cost method. Any securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Wall Street Management Corporation (the Advisor) pursuant to guidelines established by the Board of Directors. 

(b) Federal Income and Excise Taxes  The Fund intends to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all net investment company taxable income and net capital gains to shareholders in a manner which results in no tax cost to the Fund. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is recorded. 

(c) Distributions to Shareholders  Dividends from net investment income are declared and paid at least annually. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, will be declared and paid at least annually. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain of its 

See notes to the financial statements.

THE WALL STREET FUND, INC. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)December 31, 2003


capital accounts as a result of the recognition and characterization of certain income and capital gain distributions determined annually in accordance with federal tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. 

(d) Securities Transactions and Investment Income Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial statement purposes. The Fund determines the gain or loss realized from the investment transactions by comparing the original cost of the security lot sold with the net sale proceeds. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Acquisition and market discounts and premiums are amortized over the life of the security. 

3.   Investment Transactions 
Purchases and sales of securities for the year ended December 31, 2003, excluding short-term investments, aggregated $13,067,682 and $13,414,542 respectively. There were no purchases or sales of long-term U.S. government securities. 

4.   Investment Advisor 
The Fund has an investment advisory agreement with Wall Street Management Corporation. (WSMC or the Advisor). The Advisory agreement provides for advisory fees at an annual rate of 0.50% of the Funds average daily net assets. The present advisory agreement also provides for the Advisor to reimburse the Fund for any expenses (including the advisor fee but excluding taxes, interest and brokerage fees and extraordinary expenses incurred in connection with any matter not in the ordinary course of business of the Fund) over 2.00% of the first $10,000,000, 1.50% of the next $20,000,000 and 1.00% of any balance of the average daily net assets of the Fund. 

The Fund has a shareholder servicing agreement (a Servicing Agreement) with the Advisor pursuant to which the Advisor may compensate certain persons who provide shareholder services, including answering customer inquiries, assisting in processing purchase, exchange and redemption transactions and furnishing Fund communications to shareholders. For services provided under the Servicing Agreement, the Advisor receives fees from the Fund at an annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily net assets. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Advisor received $35,472 in shareholder servicing fees. 

The Advisor also serves as the Funds principal underwriter. Certain of the officers and directors of the Fund are officers and directors of WSMC.

6.   Information for Federal Income Tax Purposes 
The components of the net unrealized appreciation in the value of the investments held at December 31, 2003 for tax purposes are as follows: 





Gross unrealized appreciation of investments 

$ 4,715,801 


Gross unrealized depreciation of investments 

(523,002) 


Net unrealized appreciation of investments 



 $ 4,192,799 


 





At December 31, 2003, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was $13,266,189. The primary difference between the cost of investments for book purposes and tax purposes is due to deferred wash sale losses. 

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had accumulated net realized capital loss carryovers of $3,395,465 that will expire between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2011. To the extent the Fund realizes future net capital gains, taxable distributions to its shareholders will be offset by any unusued capital loss carryover.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders ofThe Wall Street Fund, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Wall Street Fund, Inc. (the Fund) at December 31, 2003, and the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as financial statements) are the responsibility of the Funds management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The chart assumes an initial investment of $10,000. Performance reflects fee waivers. In the absence of fee waivers, the total return would be reduced. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all dividends and other distributions, but do not reflect the deductions of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. The performance information shown represents past performance and should not be interpreted indicative of the Funds future performance. Return and share price will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Dear Shareholders, 

We are pleased to report that for the year ended December 31, 2003, your fund registered a return of +49.90%. 

Six months ago, we concluded our piece as follows: We welcome a rational market, moving in anticipation of reasonable fundamentals, with the knowing assumption of risk, as this will provide the best opportunity for realizing excellent gains over time. 

For the full year, the S&P 500 rose 26.4%, the Dow Jones added 25.3%. The NASDAQ Composite added an amazing 50.0% and the Russell 2000 advanced 47.3%. The market generally favored smaller to mid-size companies with higher volatility; this is a normal occurrence coming off the bottom after a severe bear market. We are in a broad market advance in anticipation of continued economic progress on many fronts. The more growth-oriented companies are most likely to outperform. Indeed, our search for the best values today is among companies with sustainable earnings acceleration. Our work indicates a narrow spread today between valuation levels for small, mid and large cap names, further suggesting that the winners will be determined by such fundamentals as earnings visibility, cash flow and reinvestment rates, more frequently found in the smaller and mid-size companies than the large behemoths th
at are still cutting employment. 

We are increasingly hearing from managements of the companies that we research that this recovery is for real, that it has power and sustainability. We have enumerated the underlying reasons for this over the past year: an accommodative Fed, government deficit spending, the beneficial effect of tax cuts, a more fairly priced (not weaker!) dollar, pent-up demand, notably for technology investment, enhanced productivity from continuous cost-cutting, and the constancy of the consumer, supported by real income growth. Despite ongoing risks to our troops, the recent capture of Saddam Hussein lends further confidence to this positive mix. 

We have been and remain bullish on the economy. The December ISM Purchasing Managers Index release shows incredible strength. The index rose to 66.2 from 62.8; the last time that the index was over the 60 level was in the 1980s. Some components of the index are remarkable, considering from whence we came. New orders at 77.6 paced production at 73.0. Inventories actually fell as demand and backlog increased. Jobs are being created. Despite the media attention, we note that recoveries are always jobless until confidence rises and hard evidence mounts that the recovery is real. 

The Fed appears committed to keeping rates low and stimulus ongoing, and has repeated this in public pronouncements made by various Fed Governors. Monetary base growth is sustainable, running at 5.5% year over year. Given that core inflation is extremely low, the Fed can probably keep the stimulus going at this meaningful level. As the economy recovers and confirmation of economic strength becomes ever more visible, there is going to be talk of inflation, and talk of tightening, which may have the similar effect as tightening itself. It is possible to see the market itself raise interest rates in anticipation of a Fed move, so that the Fed may actually follow the market. Yet this is likely some ways off as long as capacity utilization and employment are below historical norms. 

The term weak is perhaps unduly pejorative when applied to the dollar. In this case, we believe that Treasury Secretary Snow has grasped the fundamentals behind our trade balances, and has done a great service to our export economy by allowing the dollar to be priced more fairly; this action favors the core manufacturing sector. We expect that exports may increase at a rate greater tan our domestic GDP growth, with significant collateral implications for corporate profits and future employment. 

The risks, apart from another terrorist event, include a surprise re-emergence of inflation, a more rapid up-tick in interest rates, perhaps an oil shock, or worldwide health issues. The major positive is the tremendous momentum built up as the year came to a close. Moreover, we believe that the heightened state of readiness of our government, military, and even of our monetary authorities, represents a positive factor. Going into an election year, we see a bias towards the status quo in terms of economic policy. The media will certainly grab any opportunity to make a headline out of changes in fortunes during the ongoing political campaign. But based on current conditions, we anticipate a re-election of the incumbents and continued economic progress through the first years of the next term. 

The fragility of psychology remains high, yet we truly believe that the fragility of the fundamentals is very low. While we expect some heightened volatility in the coming months, we believe that we are on a path towards generally higher equity prices across the broad spectrum of market capitalization for some time to come.

Item 2. Code of Ethics. 

The registrant has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrants principal executive officer and principal financial officer. The registrant has not made any amendments to its code of ethics during the covered period. The registrant has not granted any waivers from any provisions of the code of ethics during the covered period. 

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert. 

The registrants board of trustees has determined that it does not have an audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee. At this time, the registrant believes that the experience provided by each member of the audit committee together offers the registrant adequate oversight for the registrants level of financial complexity. 

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

The registrant has engaged its principal accountant to perform audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services during the past two fiscal years. Audit services refer to performing an audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years. Audit-related services refer to the assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit. Tax services refer to professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. Other services provided by the principal accountant were N/A. The following table details the aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and other fees by the principa
l accountant.

The audit committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures that require the audit committee to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services of the registrant, including services provided to any entity affiliated with the registrant. All of the principal accountants hours spent on auditing the registrants financial statements were attributed to work performed by full-time permanent employees of the principal accountant. 

The following table indicates the non-audit fees billed by the registrants accountant for services to the registrant and to the registrants investment adviser (and any other controlling entity, etc.not sub-adviser) for the last two years. The audit committee of the board of trustees has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the registrant's investment adviser is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence and has concluded that the provision of such non-audit services by the accountant has not compromised the accountants independence.

THE WALL STREET FUND, INC 

Code of Ethics

The following principles and responsibilities shall govern the professional conduct of the Principal Officers: 



HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT 

The Principal Officers shall act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest in personal and professional relationships, and shall report any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such conflict between their interests and those of the Fund to the Audit Committee, the full Board of Directors of the Fund, and, in addition, to any other appropriate person or entity that may reasonably be expected to deal with any conflict of interest in timely and expeditious manner. 

The Principal Officers shall act in good faith, responsibly, with due care, competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or allowing their independent judgment to be subordinated or compromised. 
2.      FINANCIAL RECORDS AND REPORTING 

The Principal Officers shall provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and/or other documents to be filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable body by the Fund, or that is otherwise publicly disclosed or communicated. The Principal Officers shall comply with applicable rules and regulations of federal, state, and local governments, and other appropriate private and public regulatory agencies. 

The Principal Officers shall respect the confidentiality of information acquired in the course of their work and shall not disclose such information except when authorized or legally obligated to disclose. The Principal Officers will not use confidential information acquired in the course of their duties as Principal Officers. 

The Principal Officers shall share knowledge and maintain skills important and relevant to the Funds needs; shall proactively promote ethical behavior of the Funds employees and as a partner with industry peers and associates; and shall maintain control over and responsibly manage assets and resources employed or entrusted to them by the Fund. 
 
3.      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS 

The Principal Officers shall establish and maintain mechanisms to oversee the compliance of the Fund with applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or administrative rule, and to identify, report and correct in a swift and certain manner, any detected deviations from applicable federal, state or local law regulation or rule. 
 
4.       COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CODE OF ETHICS 

The Principal Officers shall promptly report any violations of this Code of Ethics to the Audit Committee as well as the full Board of Directors of the Fund and shall be held accountable for strict adherence to this Code of Ethics. A proven failure to uphold the standards stated herein shall be grounds for such sanctions as shall be reasonably imposed by the Board of Directors of the Fund. 
 
5.       AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 

This Code of Ethics may only be amended or modified by approval of the Board of Directors. Any substantive amendment that is not technical or administrative in nature or any material waiver, implicit or otherwise, of any provision of this Code of Ethics, shall be communicated publicly in accordance with Item 2 of Form N-CSR under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
