George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

About Acne Specialist Products

Acne Specialists
About Acne Specialist Products
 







Acne treatment products specialized for problematic skin
Most over-the-counter acne treatment products are not strong enough to clear moderate-to-severe acne. If you suffer from chronic acne, you will need professional-grade acne treatment products.
Acne Specialists products contain professional-grade ingredients for acne-prone skin. However, because these products are so strong, you also need guidance on how to use them correctly, as to not make acne worse.
 
 

Acne Specialists hand-select all products for every client
and provide the regimen for correct usage.
Existing clients can reorder product online
and select shipping or pick-up at checkout.

Pore Clogging Ingredients List

Acne Specialists
Pore Clogging Ingredients List
 







Ingredients in everyday products are common causes of acne
These ingredients could be found in your make-up, shampoo, toothpaste, and face wash!
Even if you read “won’t clog pores” or “noncomedogenic” on the bottle, no government agency oversees product labels for their effectiveness in treating acne. Skincare companies can market their products for clear skin, but the products contain ingredients that actually worsen acne.
For example, harsh chemicals like sodium lauryl sulfate is a harsh chemical that’s added as a foaming agent to cleansers, but clogs pores. Even natural ingredients found in organic skin care products, like shea butter and coconut oil, cause acne.
We have identified the ingredients that cause acne in our Pore Clogging Ingredients List
We have identified the worst offenders in our Pore Clogging Ingredients List. Do not put anything on your skin or hair without first checking our Pore Clogging Ingredients List first.
If you’re just getting started, book your initial consultation with us. We help New Clients pinpoint any products that could be causing your breakouts.
So, what products can you use? We carry a special line of products are guaranteed to be acne-safe. Also, read our blog for recommendations on acne-safe products.

About Acne Specialist Products
 







Acne treatment products specialized for problematic skin
Most over-the-counter acne treatment products are not strong enough to clear moderate-to-severe acne. If you suffer from chronic acne, you will need professional-grade acne treatment products.
Acne Specialists products contain professional-grade ingredients for acne-prone skin. However, because these products are so strong, you also need guidance on how to use them correctly, as to not make acne worse.
 
 

Acne Specialists hand-select all products for every client
and provide the regimen for correct usage.
Existing clients can reorder product online
and select shipping or pick-up at checkout.
If you are a new client, please contact us
for consultation on product purchases.

Julie Pruitt
Founder + Licensed Esthetician “As a lifelong acne sufferer, I understand how debilitating this disease can be. I was embarrassed to leave the house, go to work, and forget about taking a picture of me! Then I found relief through specialized products and facial treatments at an acne-specialized clinic. Finally, I could go out in public with confidence and happily take pictures with my friends and family. Once I experienced the joy of clear skin, I became passionate about helping others who were still suffering from acne and decided to change careers. After working as a schoolteacher, I became a licensed esthetician in 2005 and worked in a clinic where we cleared the skin of thousands of people. Now I continue my passion at Acne Specialists of Oakland, where I am passionate about helping you achieve clear skin and renew your self confidence. You can email me anytime at jpacne@gmail.com.”


 




 
Annie Pineda
Bilingual Licensed Esthetician “For over 25 years, I have treated acne-prone skin and worked with the best in the business. Before he passed, I even worked with Dr. James E. Fulton, the Standford dermatologist who wrote the book Acne RX. I first met Julie, Francesca and Melissa 8 years ago at another clinic and have always been impressed by their dedication to clearing skin. When there was an opening for an esthetician position at Acne Specialists, I jumped at the opportunity to work with these women, who are truly experts at what they do. As an Acne Specialist, I bring my kind, gentle approach to clearing problematic skin. Additionally, I am bilingual in English and Spanish.”


 




 
Beth Morse
Licensed Esthetician “I am a self-admitted skin geek. While growing up in San Francisco, I struggled with cystic acne for most of my adolescence, but I learned the importance of maintaining skin health both internally and externally, which is how I found my passion for skin care. After completing my program at The San Francisco Institute of Esthetics & Cosmetology, my esthetics career quickly began to flourish. Eventually, I became an educator at my alma mater then rose to become the Esthetics Advisor of their skincare program. Although I loved teaching, my true joy lies in treating troubled skin, so I transitioned back to the treatment room as a peel specialist. I am fueled by my passion for the study of skin care science and ingredient technology, which has led me to specialize in result-focused and cutting edge treatments in aging, acne, pigmentation and sophisticated peel treatments.”


 
 



 
Melissa Robles
Licensed Esthetician “Before I found Julie, I suffered from acne for more than 10 years. Sometimes I would take sick days from work because I thought my skin was so bad. I was so tired of buying new products and getting my hopes up only to find out they did nothing. Then I found Julie and my life changed. I learned from Julie that most skin types can tolerate strong acne products – it’s how you use them that makes the difference. I just needed some guidance on how to customize a regimen that worked for my skin. Within two months, my skin was mostly clear (faster than normal). As my skin cleared, I became more extroverted and comfortable meeting new people. Inspired by my new found happiness, I wanted to help others suffering from acne and became a licensed esthetician. I’m constantly thankful for having a job where I can a difference in the way people live.”


 




 
Francesca Buongiorno    
Licensed Esthetician “Having suffered from hormonal acne myself at the beginning of my esthetics career, I know how embarrassing and frustrating this condition can be. I began my esthetics career at Silk Day Spa in New York City in 2005, where I became skilled at performing a variety of skin and body treatments. I also took advanced courses in esthetics at the International Dermal Institute, where I learned about skin physiology and techniques in treating many skin conditions. After moving to the Bay Area in 2010, I worked at Tru Spa in San Francisco and completed a Certification in Clinical Esthetics in 2011 from Concepts Institute of Esthetics. Shortly after this, I began working at Face Reality Acne Clinic as an Acne Specialist, where I found real satisfaction in my work by seeing remarkable and lasting change in my clients’ skin. It thrills me to be able to share my knowledge and help others achieve their goals of clear skin.”

5 Reasons Your Skin Stills Breaks Out
July 27, 2017 · Lifestyle · No Comments

  


As we always say, consistency is key to for keeping your skin clear of acne.
So, what do we mean by consistency?
We mean that you’re:

Consistently using acne-safe skin care products
Consistently sticking to the personalized day and night regimen provided by your Acne Specialist
Consistently practicing lifestyle and health habits that help, not hurt, your skin

Sometimes, you’re doing everything right, but you’re still breaking out. It’s time to look at what you do everyday and find the culprit.
Here’s our top 5 most common reasons you’re still breaking out:


Have you checked your hair care and makeup products against our Pore Clogger List recently?Even if you’re doing everything right with your skincare routine, diet, and lifestyle, but your other products contain pore clogging ingredients, you will always continue to struggle with acne. Always check the ingredients against our Pore Clogging Ingredients List.


Are you really sticking to your home skin care regimen?Acne Specialists create a personalized skin care regimen for your morning and night product routine. Every single product selected for you is intended to fight acne and prevent new lesions from forming.
Sometimes, you run low on product… We get it. But if you run out, or skip a day, acne will have a chance to form. It can take months to clear up existing acne, so it’s easier to prevent breakouts in the first place.

How much of the active products are you using?Your Acne Specialist will instruct you on how much product to use. In general, you need about a dime to nickel size amount of both the exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide cream. 


When was your last facial appointment?Once your skin is clear, you and your Acne Specialist will determine how often you should have a facial appointment. Everyone’s skin is different, but most people do best if they come every 4-8 weeks. Others have more sensitive skin that requires frequent maintenance appointments to stay clear.


Has your diet or lifestyle changed?When it comes to your diet, the worst offenders are dairy, sugar, peanuts and processed foods. Many people also start breaking out when they implement a new exercise routine or start supplementing with protein powder or vitamins. Biotin and whey protein are especially aggravating for acne prone skin. Stress is also a huge factor, so starting a new job or going through a big life change can cause acne to flare.


Of course, we’re here to keep you blemish-free.
Always feel free to contact us at jpacne@gmail.com if you have questions or concerns about your skin.

Clear skin without prescriptions
Many doctors treat acne with Accutane, antibiotics or other prescriptions that have unpleasant side-effects. Rather than treating acne with harsh medications, Acne Specialists work with you to find the personalized regimen, treatments and products that will clear your skin.

Meet your guides to clear skin
If you’re like me, you’ve tried everything from Clean & Clear to Pro-Activ, from antibiotics to Accutane… and still your skin is full of aggravated pimples and persistent acne. We understand how embarrassing and frustrating this skin condition can be. And we’re here to help. We are former sufferers of acne who discovered treatments that work. Now we have turned our old pains into passions for helping people who are suffering from this debilitating condition.
Our Acne Specialists have treated thousands of people to clear skin and have a 95% success rate. We will compassionately treat your skin with regimens designed specifically for your skin’s needs. Take a look at the successful reviews on Yelp and before and after pictures.
“My skin most days looks flawless.
I’m at the point where I go in for a facial maybe once a month or more,
and the last time I had a facial my skin looked like porcelain.
I never EVER thought I’d have clear skin again until Julie and Francesca worked with me.
They’re both compassionate, experienced, and charming women
who will tailor your products and treatment to your skin
and give killer facials.”
–Nicole B. on Yelp
Getting started
Initial consultation
Lifestyle, diet, medical conditions and products all affect your skin and may cause acne. You will begin with the new client questionnaire for our Acne Specialists to evaluate what could be causing your acne and consult you on product and lifestyle choices. We will also create a personalized regimen to guide you to clear skin.
Acne-safe products selected for you
Harsh chemicals in your face-wash, make-up, shampoo and toothpaste can aggravate your skin or build-up as toxins in your body that release as acne. Using acne safe products is key to clear skin, so we carry the highest-quality products designed for acne-prone skin. No more guessing at the drug store — our specialists will personalize your regimen for your problematic skin. For best results, we will work closely with you and need your compliance.
Facial treatments
During an in-person treatment, we gently treat your skin with highly concentrated products and extract acne-causing blackheads. This process is essential to quickly clearing your skin and preventing future breakouts. We recommend that new clients visit us for in-person treatments 1-3 times per month, depending on the skin’s needs.
After a acne-specialized facial treatment, your skin will be pink and blotchy from extractions and the chemical peel. Your skin may also flake for a few days as new skin comes to the surface. We do not recommend exercising or doing hot yoga for 12 hours post treatment.
Cancellations within 24 hours incur a 50% service fee.
Your first 6-months
Getting acne under control
Bacteria builds as blackheads beneath the skin and may not appear as acne for several months. In the beginning of treatments, you will need extractions and peels every two weeks to clear your current acne and prevent new acne from forming. New clients will see an acne specialist every 2 weeks for the first 3 treatments, and then every 3 weeks for the following 3 treatments. Most clients see amazing results after 6-12 treatments.
Maintenance treatments
Once your acne is under control and the beautiful skin underneath reveals itself, you will need less treatments. Depending on your skin, your maintenance treatments may be 4, 6 or 8 week intervals. Maintenance treatments with chemical peels and extractions are essential to prevent new acne from forming.

You are about to take the first step on your journey to clear skin. Just answer three simple questions. We’ll email you back within two business days.
