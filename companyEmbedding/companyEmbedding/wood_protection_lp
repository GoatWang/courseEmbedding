Wood Stain Products | Wood Sealant Products | Wood Stains                  Wood StainsHome / Wood StainsCONTACT USReady SealA professional grade oil based semi-transparent stain and sealer in one1-888-STAIN-4U My Account Sign up 0 Items - $0.00SEARCH GO  Search for:  Wood StainsThose looking for a product that can handle all aspects of any outdoor wood project will want to make sure to use Ready Seal Stain and Sealer for Wood. Although originally designed for those in the field of professional restoration as well as the commercial contractor market, this product has since branched out into the DIY sector as well as those homeowners who are interested in enhancing the look of any number of outside items.This professional grade wood stain will not only offer a valuable coat of protection for decks and outdoor furniture, it can help refurbish other potential areas around a home or community, like a fence or maybe a gazebo.Product ColorsThe range of Ready Seal colors include Mahogany, Dark Walnut, Golden Pine, Light Oak, Mahogany, Redwood, Pecan and Natural Cedar. Each are dark pigmented colors that can then be mixed together.While Ready Seal is set up to be goof proof, it’s important to remember some key factors. It should never be mixed with sealers or stains that are water-based, and that Ready Seal isn’t compatible with many of the sealers or stains on the market. In addition, avoid tinting Ready Seal colors that have already been premixed.Getting the Proper FinishWhen the job is complete, the finish will be one that’s natural and flat. Also, the durability will help make sure that no peeling, flaking or chipping will end up developing, while the possibility of the seal cracking also won’t be a concern. Finally, UV Ray protection is yet another part of the overall value.One of the most important things to remember when it comes to applying Ready Seal is that strictly following the included instructions is important. That’s because applying too much could help create any number of problems. These include extending the drying period or giving your wood an unwanted glossy finish.Ready Seal is a product that will already save the user time, since they no longer have to apply a wood stain and then top that off with a wood sealer. This product takes care of that with one simple application.Versatility and Easy MaintenanceOne of the best reasons to use Ready Seal Wood Stain and Sealant is that it’s versatile enough to adapt to whatever wood type you have. The end result will be a professional look that will have others marveling at the quality look that’s presented.Maintenance is also a breeze, since all that’s really needed prior to an application is to let the wood dry and clean it. From there, just add another application, with no need to strip or sand anything.Whatever outdoor wood project is on the agenda is one that can definitely be improved by using Ready Seal. If you’d like more information, make sure to contact a company representative at 1-888-STAIN-4U, and if there are questions, feel free to check out the FAQ section

In addition, avoid tinting Ready Seal colors that have already been premixed.Getting the Proper FinishWhen the job is complete, the finish will be one that’s natural and flat. Also, the durability will help make sure that no peeling, flaking or chipping will end up developing, while the possibility of the seal cracking also won’t be a concern. Finally, UV Ray protection is yet another part of the overall value.One of the most important things to remember when it comes to applying Ready Seal is that strictly following the included instructions is important. That’s because applying too much could help create any number of problems. These include extending the drying period or giving your wood an unwanted glossy finish.Ready Seal is a product that will already save the user time, since they no longer have to apply a wood stain and then top that off with a wood sealer. This product takes care of that with one simple application.Versatility and Easy MaintenanceOne of the best reasons to use Ready Seal Wood Stain and Sealant is that it’s versatile enough to adapt to whatever wood type you have. The end result will be a professional look that will have others marveling at the quality look that’s presented.Maintenance is also a breeze, since all that’s really needed prior to an application is to let the wood dry and clean it. From there, just add another application, with no need to strip or sand anything.Whatever outdoor wood project is on the agenda is one that can definitely be improved by using Ready Seal.

"I feel that the new Tachyon Mini-V is the most powerful and most cost effective shield against EMF's that is available today."
“After testing almost every devices on the market,I discovered the Tachyon Mini-V.""The Mini-V was consistently at least 100 times more EMF protective than any other device.” 
“I and my family now wear the Tachyon Mini-V all the time” 
 As a holistic physician Dr. Cousens is continually working with EMF sensitive people. “I recommend it to all my patients, and especially my diabetes patients whose blood sugar goes up when exposed to EMFs.” I feel that the new Tachyon Mini-V is the most powerful and most cost effective shield against EMFs that is available today."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

If so, I will return to buy many more.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
