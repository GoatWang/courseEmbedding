In an effort to offer our customers the very best prices, we deal in high volumes that can be overwhelming � even within our 350,000-square-foot facility. Sometimes, we need to slash the prices on some items to clear out the old and make room for something new. But our loss is definitely your gain!
Choose any of these custom gifts or various bulk promotional items, and you�ll find the best possible prices � even lower than our already affordable items listed elsewhere on this site. 
Clearance doesn�t mean lower quality
Items in our wholesale clearance catalog are the same quality found across our site, with full customization and personalization available. They�re simply available at up to 50% off normal wholesale cost because we need to move stock on these items quickly.
Browse this list of clearance items to find promotional giveaways for your next tradeshow, branded office supplies as gifts for your staff, or custom wedding favors for your special day. We promise that these are our very best deals available.

THICK MOLDING COMPOUNDS (TMC)

THICK MOLDING COMPOUNDS (TMC)
Thick molding compounds may be the answer if you need to combine the excellent flow properties of bulk molding compounds with the excellent mechanical properties of sheet molding compounds or if you need strong parts with complex shapes. Because they are up to six times thicker than typical sheet molding compounds, larger parts that are typically compression molded can be injection molded instead.

Injection Molding
Compression Molding
Resin Transfer Molding
Open / Hand Lay-up
Pultrusion
Machining
Finishing
Tooling & Part Design






















Capitalize on our experience.
We support our advanced materials innovation with world-class technical expertise, innovation and customer collaboration.
















































MOLDED PARTS
We work closely with our customers to understand application requirements and optimize part design to improve performance and manufacturability. Molds are designed to support high output, low scrap and maintenance requirements. Our in-house toolmakers design and build secondary tooling and maintain production molds, including the following:











INJECTION MOLDING
The presses used for injection molding are horizontally operated with a unique material delivery system. The thermoset compound is fed and injected with a high speed reciprocating screw or a plunger system that reduces glass degradation for better part strength.











COMPRESSION MOLDING
This molding process utilizes a pre-staged charge of material that is created by manually or automatically cutting, stacking, arranging and weighing the individual SMC or TMC pieces. This charge is either manually or automatically loaded into the open mold. Once the charge is placed, the mold is closed with a fast closing speed followed by a controlled final closure speed once the thermoset compound begins to flow. As the compound flows in the mold, it reaches a telescoping shear edge zone at the perimeter of the cavity that enables air to escape.











RESIN TRANSFER MOLDING
Perfect for medium volume runs or highly detailed parts, the resin transfer process offers key advantages over open molding because it creates smooth surfaces on both sides of a part and it allows ribs and bosses to be molded in. Resin Transfer Molding offers lower cost tooling than compression molding although the surface quality approaches that of compression parts. Resin transfer is also useful for prototyping compression molded parts, since mechanical properties are similar.











OPEN / HAND LAY-UP
Open Molding parts are appropriate for large parts with low to medium volumes and one finished surface. The process is capable of molding in undercuts and hardware such as brackets. Resin and gel-coats can be color matched to eliminate the need for secondary finishing. Hand lay-up parts are also used for functional prototyping. Open Molding utilizes low cost polyester molds built by our in-house Tooling Department.












PULTRUSION
Pultrusion is a manufacturing process used to produce continuous lengths of  composite materials with constant cross-sections. The process involves pulling raw materials (liquid resin mixtures) through a heated steel forming die using a continuous pulling device.











MACHINING
Where precision machining is required, we can meet the tightest tolerances – and we have the capacity to meet demanding volume and scheduling requirements, as well. Highly-complex parts and those with extraordinary tolerances can be produced in our three-axis and five-axis CNC machining centers.












FINISHING
Finishing is performed with a level of craftsmanship and attention-to-detail that complements our precision manufacturing processes. Quite often, an excellent finish and color can be molded into the product. When that’s not possible, we offer a variety of paint finishes, including smooth, blemish-free painted and silkscreened parts, high gloss painting, as well as texture painting, which offers a uniform appearance from lot to lot – and with six paint booths we have the capacity to meet demanding volume and scheduling needs.












TOOLING & PART DESIGN
We offer full support across all molding technologies, including tool and part design, physical testing, mold flow analysis, prototyping and validation.

If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
