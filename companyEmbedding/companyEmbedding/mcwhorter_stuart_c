Stuart C. McWhorter | Clemson University News and Stories, South Carolina



























































 





Stuart C. McWhorter



Crystal Boyles, Creative Services 
August 24, 2010

Share




In the decade since he graduated from Clemson, Tiger mascot Stuart McWhorter has continued to be a leader.
After earning his bachelor’s degree in management from Clemson,  McWhorter served as an intern with the U.S. Budget Committee before  earning his MBA from the University of Alabama-Birmingham. He then  became vice president of physician development with Tenet Healthcare  Corporation and was founder and vice president of OrthoLink Physicians  Corporation, now United Surgical Partners (NASDAQ: USPI).
In 1996, McWhorter and his father founded their own firm, Clayton  Associates LLC, an investment firm in Nashville, Tenn., that serves as a  hub of strategic business development activities for health care and  diversified service and technology firms throughout the Southeast.
But the man who previously wore the Tiger suit hasn’t forgotten his  Clemson experience, and he’s continuing his family’s commitment to  philanthropy in his own innovative way.
Part of McWhorter’s gift to the Clemson University Foundation will  establish a student investment fund in conjunction with the University’s  Trading Room in the College of Business and Behavioral Science. Clemson  has one of only a few collegiate “Wall Street laboratories” nationwide  in which finance students work with the same resources that professional  brokers utilize to research, buy and sell securities. McWhorter’s  contribution will enable them to make real-time transactions with real  funds through a licensed broker. If successful, proceeds will benefit  the Clemson Foundation.
In support of Tiger Pride, the athletics component of The Clemson  Commitment capital campaign for upgrading athletic facilities, McWhorter  is adding art to Memorial Stadium. Fittingly, McWhorter will fund a  bronze tiger to be installed in the soon-to-be-renovated West End Zone.
“I draw from my experiences at Clemson so often. In many ways, a  student’s years in college lay the foundation for future achievements,”  says McWhorter. “I hope to encourage tomorrow’s alumni to remember the  University and to sustain the continuum of support.”
