Compounder China XD Plastics Co. Ltd. has signed an agreement to build capacity for 300,000 metric tons of bioplastics as well as 3-D printing materials.
The signing ceremony took place on Dec. 12, according to reports by state-owned local media in Sichuan province, although Nasdaq-listed China XD has not yet made its own announcement.
The project will reportedly break ground in March 2017 and complete construction in October 2018.
The company plans to invest 2.2 billion yuan ($316 million) to build 50 production lines of bio-based compound materials, targeting food packaging, engineering, and light-weighting applications. Another 300 million yuan ($43 million) will be invested on four production lines of FDM (fused deposition modeling) filaments as well as one production line of SLS (selective laser sintering) powder.
The new project is expected to complement the 300,000-metric-ton compounding plant the company launched in July at the same site in Nanchong, Sichuan province.

HARBIN, China, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- China XD Plastics Company Limited (NASDAQ: CXDC) ("China XD Plastics" or the "Company"), one of China's leading specialty chemical players engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications, today announced the official signing of investment agreements between its subsidiary, Heilongjiang Xinda Enterprise Group Company Limited, and the Management Committee of Harbin Economic - Technological Development Zone with respect to the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, the industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory (the "Project").
"The official signing of the investment agreements for the Project is another milestone for the Company," said Jie Han, Chairman and CEO of China XD Plastics. "This Project will help the Company to expand its product mix into bio-based composites, 3D printing materials and functional masterbatch materials while maintaining our traditional petroleum-based materials. Paving the path to non-auto applications and further diversifying our company's business as a key element of our strategic plan.
In its 'Made in China 2025' and 'The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan', the Chinese Government highlighted biological composite materials and additive manufacturing used composite materials as key planning technology areas and clearly stated the importance of strengthening R&D in bio-based polymer materials, and developing bioplastics packaging, bioplastics auto parts and other related areas as part of a nationwide initiative in supply side reform to promote the field of additive manufacturing used composite materials.  Encouraged by the strong demand and market potential for biological composite materials, additive manufacturing used composite materials and functional masterbatch materials, the Company's Board of Directors preliminarily approved the Company's strategic investment in these initiatives in December 2016 and on June 1, 2017, respectively. The Company's Board of Directors subsequently ratified the Company's capital investment in the Project.
As part of the Company's strategic investment, the Company will develop 120,000 metric tons of capacity for petroleum-based materials, 300,000 metric tons of capacity for biological composite materials and 10,100 metric tons of capacity for additive manufacturing used composite materials pursuant to the Project. The total capital expenditures for the Company will be RMB 4.15 billion (estimated to be US$ 614 million). Both the industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials and the industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacturing demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory are expected to be completed by the end of July 2019. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics is expected to be completed by the end of June 2018.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  3.04 (07/27/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.53      Market Cap $232.71 M     Shares Outstanding 49.51 M     Public Float 16.62 M     Yield CXDC has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 19,259     Change from Last  3.38%      Percent of Float 0.12%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.48      Net Money Flow ($)  -4,006    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
