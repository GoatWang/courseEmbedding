First SGT. STUBBY Teaser Set To Launch June 14, 2017









PR Newswire




Jun 13, 2017 11:08 AM EDT













 


















































  COLUMBUS, Ga. and VENICE, Calif., June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fun Academy Motion Pictures today announced a partnership with fan-centric entertainment website Movie Pilot to reveal the first official teaser trailer for the upcoming animated feature film SGT. STUBBY: AN AMERICAN HERO via Facebook on Wednesday, June 14, 2017.     "We're honored and excited to be partnering with Fun Academy to reveal this unique tale to the world," says Movie Pilot CEO Tobi Bauckhage. "In a world of remakes and limitless social content, our fans are sending us signals every day that they're interested in fresh, authentic stories. We can't wait to show Stubby to the world." The film tells the incredible true story of Stubby, a stray dog who became a hero of the First World War after being adopted off the streets by an American Soldier. For performing numerous heroic feats beyond his small stature, Sgt. Stubby is still recognized today as the first dog promoted through combat and the most decorated canine in American history. To tell Stubby's tale, Fun Academy has enlisted the voice talents of Logan Lerman ( PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS) to voice Stubby's owner and best friend Robert Conroy, as well as Academy Award® nominees Helena Bonham Carter (THE KING'S SPEECH, HARRY POTTER) and Gérard Depardieu ( CYRANO DE BERGERAC, LIFE OF PI). The film also features an original score by award-winning composer Patrick Doyle (BRAVE, CINDERELLA, THOR).

COLUMBUS, Ga. and VENICE, Calif., June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fun Academy Motion Pictures today announced a partnership with fan-centric entertainment website Movie Pilot to reveal the first official teaser trailer for the upcoming animated feature film SGT. STUBBY: AN AMERICAN HERO via Facebook on Wednesday, June 14, 2017.













                See the exclusive reveal of SGT. STUBBY's first official teaser trailer on Wednesday, June 14 at 10:00 am PST/1:00 pm EST: www.facebook.com/moviepilotdotcom
              

 
 



"We're honored and excited to be partnering with Fun Academy to reveal this unique tale to the world," says Movie Pilot CEO Tobi Bauckhage. "In a world of remakes and limitless social content, our fans are sending us signals every day that they're interested in fresh, authentic stories. We can't wait to show Stubby to the world."
The film tells the incredible true story of Stubby, a stray dog who became a hero of the First World War after being adopted off the streets by an American Soldier. For performing numerous heroic feats beyond his small stature, Sgt. Stubby is still recognized today as the first dog promoted through combat and the most decorated canine in American history.
To tell Stubby's tale, Fun Academy has enlisted the voice talents of Logan Lerman (PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS) to voice Stubby's owner and best friend Robert Conroy, as well as Academy Award® nominees Helena Bonham Carter (THE KING'S SPEECH, HARRY POTTER) and Gérard Depardieu (CYRANO DE BERGERAC, LIFE OF PI). The film also features an original score by award-winning composer Patrick Doyle (BRAVE, CINDERELLA, THOR).
Richard Lanni, director and producer of the film, commented on the announcement by saying, "Sgt. Stubby is close to the hearts of all who work on this exciting project. We eagerly await the reaction of our audience and the industry."
SGT. STUBBY is produced by Fun Academy Media Group, Ltd. with animation by Technicolor company Mikros Image (CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: THE FIRST EPIC MOVIE) from their studios in Paris and Montreal. Fun Academy will distribute the film throughout North America. 
The film is slated to premiere on April 13, 2018. Follow Stubby and Conroy's journey out of the history books and onto the big screen: www.facebook.com/StubbyMovie | www.facebook.com/moviepilotdotcom

Friend to presidents, generals and grunts alike. Pioneer in his field, respected by military and academic institutions, visited by millions of people a year, subject of a variety of internet-fueled legends and soon to be the subject of a major motion picture.      Not bad for a dog. Especially one that's been dead for more than 90 years.      The story of Stubby, commonly referred to as Sgt. Stubby, is one of great service, trust and loyalty. It began in Connecticut, crossed the Atlantic into the battles of World War I, and returned home to a hero's welcome. After a lifetime of honors at the side of his owner, James Robert Conroy, Stubby died in 1926, received a 15-paragraph obituary in the New York Times, and would eventually become part of the Smithsonian's collection — his coat, laid over a cast, is on display at the National Museum of American History.      However, the details that make up the stuff of legend — the animated "Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero," is set to hit theaters in April — are a bit hazy. Chief among them: The dog's rank.            "I'm quite convinced that he was promoted by the internet," said Ann Bausum, who has written two books about Stubby. "It sounds so good, we want it to be true … and one of these reasons I think this isn't true is that there is not a single contemporary story from his lifetime, and I looked at hundreds of newspaper articles of Stubby, there is not a single one that calls him 'Sgt. Stubby.'"           Part of the confusion may come from Stubby's vest, which includes a patch with three chevrons. While they may represent a sergeant's rank today, they were used in World War I to identify soldiers — and, apparently, dogs — with overseas service.      "He was just 'Stubby,'" Bausum said. "And that was good enough for him."    Sign up for our NEW Good News Report - All positive stories about the military.

He came in with his stubby little tail and won the hearts of the men training there — he was taken along for the deployment, though the exact details on how Stubby made it to France aren't certain. It's said that then-Pvt. Conroy stowed him away on the soldiers' ship, and when found, Stubby saluted the commander. That gesture earned him passage for the rest of the journey.      In France, Stubby was said to have saved the entire division by finding and detaining a German spy. His New York Times obituary breathlessly relays the tale, saying the dog "stole out of the trenches and recognized — a German."      "Attempts by the German to deceive the dog were futile," the obituary notes.          It's also said Stubby learned when bombs where inbound and would warn the soldiers prior to the explosion.  So, if even some of the legend is true, was Stubby a so-called "war dog," or a precursor to the modern military working dog, or a mascot?      "My grandfather was always clear: He was a service dog," said Curt Deane, Conroy's grandson. "He gave the troops comfort, he gave them support. He used to run through the trenches and warn them about gas attacks. He used to go outside of the trenches and into this sort of no-man's land, between the U.S. and the German trenches, and stand by soldiers who had been injured until the medics could come and get them."       'WHERE'S STUBBY?'      All those heroics didn't necessarily make Stubby a model soldier. One of the most frequent questions asked by Conroy and his fellow soldiers with 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th Infantry Division, was, "Where's Stubby?"      "Stubby would disappear for weeks at a time," Deane said, "and the guys would kind of have no idea where he was, and there was this whole fear that he had been killed or whatever. And my grandfather would say, 'He always came back with his head held high and his stubby tail up in the air' and knew right where my grandfather was.           "It was amazing. And these troops wouldn't stay still — they were moving around, but he always came right back and knew exactly where my grandfather was."         The dog even, somehow, returned to Conroy's unit after he'd been "adopted" by French soldiers, Bausum said. Like many Stubby tales, details are thin, but he was back with the 102nd in time to return to the U.S., where he continued his service to the troops.      "There were these massive conventions at various cities, annual conventions around the country, and Stubby would go to those and he would be revered," Bausum said. "He would march in the parades, he would make newspaper headlines."      He was "known to three presidents," according to his New York Times obituary. He had his picture taken with Gen. John "Blackjack" Pershing, the highest-ranking service member since George Washington. He was an official mascot for Georgetown University (where Conroy studied law) and an honorary member of the American Red Cross, the American Legion and the YMCA — which gave him a place to sleep and up to three bones a day.       A BREED APART  Why did his story catch on? Bausum said she sees Stubby as a product of his time.       "The backdrop for it was this horrendous, horrendous war, just the volume of destruction was just so unfathomable, just sending people out in cloth uniforms against machine gun fire, just the waste, makes it a very dark war," she said. "And yet there was this story that ran through it that had so much hope in it."      Stubby didn't escape unscathed. He was wounded and gassed, according to the New York Times obituary.      (His coat sits alongside Cher Ami, a decorated carrier pigeon known for its service during World War I.)              Gen. John Pershing awards Sgt. Stubby with a gold medal in 1921. Stubby served in 17 battles and fought in four major allied offensives during WWI. (Smithsonian InstitutionÕs National Museum of American History)       Stubby died in Conroy’s arms March 16, 1926. The dog’s loyalty and tenacity have earned praise for more than a century, and have also led to some disagreement among dog lovers about Stubby’s breed, which has never been known.            "I've come to view him as sort of like a Rorschach blot, where people look at these blots of ink and individuals can see all different manners of things in the shape, and they sort of see what they want to see," Bausum said.      "If you love boxers, he's a boxer. Or if you're a pit bull fan, he's a pit bull. … When you say that he's a Boston terrier, people say, 'Well he sure doesn't look like a Boston Terrier,' but he did look like what was then a Boston terrier."      STUBBY ON SCREEN       "Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero," is set for an April 13 release. Among those lending their voices to the Hollywood-ized tale of Conroy and his dog are Helena Bonham Carter, who'll play Conroy's sister, and Gérard Depardieu, set to portray Gaston Baptiste, "a battle-tested mentor to Sgt. Stubby," according to a news release from Fun Academy Motion Pictures Studio.      As the film approaches, Deane said plans are underway to commemorate Stubby's life, and the bond he shared with his owner, in other ways. Talks are underway with the American Red Cross to allow sales of a plush Stubby doll to benefit the nonprofit's program that sends dogs to visit soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Bethesda, Maryland.                   "Stubby, originally after he died, spent a lot of time in the lobby of the American Red Cross in Washington," Deane said, "so the thought is to have a statue of Stubby at the American Red Cross because he was a permanent member."      As his grandfather told stories about Stubby, it became clear to Deane that Conroy never quite let go of his heroic dog. Deane promised his grandfather that he "would do everything possible to keep Stubby's memory alive."      "I used to always ask him why he never got another dog," Deane said of his grandfather, "and he made it very clear to me that Stubby was so special and so unique that he just couldn't imagine another dog being able to fill that role."

The use of dogs in war has a history reaching back to ancient times. The most famous American war dog was a four-legged hero of World War I named Sgt. Stubby.

Thanks to newspaper stories that had made him famous, Sgt. Stubby returned to America a hero.

Sgt. Stubby was not just famous; he reached a level of celebrity that would make even Lady Gaga, whose online viewing of her music videos recently surpassed the 1 billion mark, an afterthought. His paw shook the hands of three presidents, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, and Calvin Coolidge. Influential politicians jockeyed to be photographed with him. He led hundreds of parades across the nation and stayed in elite hotels that otherwise banned dogs. Charles Ayer Whipple, the most prominent portrait artist of the day, painted his portrait. General of the Armies John J. Pershing personally decorated him, and he received numerous honors in addition to his wartime awards.

The American Red Cross, the YMCA, and the American Legion all made him a lifetime honorary member, with the YMCA’s membership card stating that it was good for “three bones a day and a place to sleep.” He crowned his career by becoming the official mascot of Georgetown University.  Not bad for a stray pit bull mongrel that wandered onto the Yale University campus in the summer of 1917, attracted by the sounds made by recruits from the 102nd Infantry Regiment as they were training.
The pit bull mix soon fell in line with the ranks and participated in some of the drills. He became the unit’s unofficial mascot and, amongst other things, was taught how to salute with his right paw. Stubby (as he was now called) eventually bonded with Pvt. J. Robert Conroy. In early October, as the 102nd, part of the 26th “Yankee” Division, prepared to ship out to France, Conroy tucked Stubby into his overcoat and smuggled him aboard the troopship Minnesota. During the sea voyage one of the machinist mates made Stubby a special set of dog tags. Shortly after the unit disembarked at the French port of St. Nazaire, the commanding officer discovered he had an unauthorized member in his ranks. But an earnest plea from Conroy and a sharp salute from Stubby convinced the officer to let the pit bull remain, this time as the unit’s official mascot.

On one patrol Stubby found something else hidden in some bushes. It was a German spy who had been mapping the American positions. Attracted by canine barking and human cries, the patrol arrived to discover the hapless spy on the ground with Stubby’s jaws clamped onto his backside.

Stubby’s baptism of fire occurred in February 1918, shortly after the division was stationed in the Chemin des Dames sector in northern France. Within days after the troops took up position in the trenches, they were hit by a poison gas artillery barrage. Stubby survived, and from that point on was acutely sensitive to the deadly chemicals. Once, the area where Stubby’s company was deployed received a pre-dawn poison gas barrage. As soon as his nose scented the first whiff of poison gas, Stubby began raising the alarm, running back and forth through the trench, barking and nipping at the slumbering soldiers. The men awoke in time to don their mask (and fit Stubby with his), and fight off the German attack.
Stubby was not content to remain in the trenches, often accompanying raids and patrols into no man’s land, the region between the opposing armies’ trench lines. In April 1918, during a raid on the German-held town of Schieprey, Stubby was wounded by shrapnel from a German grenade.

Stubby became an expert in finding wounded or dead soldiers during patrols. On one patrol Stubby found something else hidden in some bushes. It was a German spy who had been mapping the American positions. Attracted by canine barking and human cries, the patrol arrived to discover the hapless spy on the ground with Stubby’s jaws clamped onto his backside. One of the soldiers confiscated the German’s Iron Cross and gave it to Stubby as a souvenir. The commanding officer of the 102d was reportedly so impressed by the incident that he “promoted” Stubby to sergeant. When the unit was transferred to the town of Château-Thierry, a group of women from the town made a blanket for him that soon became decorated with medals and badges.
Stubby spent eighteen months in Europe, participating in seventeen battles. Thanks to newspaper stories that had made him famous, Sgt. Stubby returned to America a hero. When Conroy enrolled at Georgetown University’s law school, Stubby became a mascot of the university’s football team.
Sgt. Stubby died in 1926. His body was preserved and, wearing his decoration-filled blanket, he is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

here is a pit bull that we can see is not mean and yet we can not see that humans are what makes the dog and that the dog just wants to be with us and make us happy so we humans make them fight and the dog get’s blamed well if we don’t forget dogs like SGT. Stubby and his human friends that trained him just showed we make the dog and the dog will be like us in the end.

The Brits had an Airedale named Jack who received the dog version of a Victoria Cross called a Dicken Award.  He died in action saving an entire battalion.  Dogs are the most amazing creature ever put on earth and prove it again and again.  What a shame they are treated so badly – especially in the cause of science.  I feel sorry for people who have no connection to the dog.

He looks almost identical to my pal, Larry, who’s ears are unclipped.   All creatures great and small have alot incommon with human animals.   It seems we’re all individuals in this experiience together.    It’d be good for us all get to know each other better and therefore learn to learn to work together so to better share and discover our greatest strengths to the mutual benefit of us all together as the collective whole that we are as the whole of existance.    The Peaceable Kingdom,  not to be sexist, though a peaceable existance for all and all for ever more so.   Even if you believe this to be unattainable and impossible,  what is there really to lose in striving for it anyway?
