        at Time Inc.
      

        New York, NY
      


Time Inc. (NYSE:TIME) is a leading content company that engages over 150 million consumers every month through our portfolio of premium brands across platforms. By combining our distinctive content with our proprietary data and people-based targeting, we offer highly differentiated end-to-end solutions to marketers across the multimedia landscape. Our influential brands include People, Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, InStyle, Real Simple and Southern Living, as well as more than 50 diverse titles in the United Kingdom. Time Inc. has been extending the power of our brands through various acquisitions and investments, including Viant, an advertising technology firm with a specialized people-based marketing platform; The Foundry, Time Inc.’s creative lab and content studio; and the People Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). The company is also home to celebrated events, such as the Time 100, Fortune Most Powerful Women, People’s Sexiest Man Alive, Sports Illustrated’s Sportsperson of the Year, the Essence Festival and the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen.
 

 
The job:
The Product Manager will help shape and develop the digital product portfolio of the Time Inc. Entertainment Group. Reaching 90 million users a month, the Entertainment Group is the largest at Time Inc. and includes signature brands PEOPLE, Entertainment Weekly, and People en Español. Reporting to the Head of Product, this is a key role for an energetic, dynamic product manager who will drive the product vision and develop best-in-class user experiences across digital platforms.
You will:

Develop, define and prioritize the product vision and strategy for Entertainment Group from development of new products to enhancements of existing products across digital platforms
Drive innovation through the product lines, particularly in mobile and video 
Engage closely with engineering and business leaders to define a roadmap that meets business and consumer needs, while meeting critical deadlines and budget constraints
Work closely with editorial and audience development teams to define a cohesive product strategy
Understand, manage and communicate prioritization of features, with a focus on user and business benefits and tradeoffs
Provide clear vision and scope documentation: use cases, workflows, wire-frames, design requirements, product requirements and other materials as needed to support UX design and development
Act as the consumer voice in all of our experiences
Manage stakeholder communications to ensure business and editorial needs are met
Track and analyze audience and engagement against industry benchmarks

You are:

Proven: You have 6 or more years of experience leading the product direction of a major brand, with at least two years of Agile or Scrum and lean methodology experience, playing the role of backlog owner. You come armed with deep technical experience in software development, design, technical architecture and web programming, a record of launching digital products that drove audience, revenue or brand growth, and an enthusiasm for user-driven product experiences. You have a clear perspective on mobile consumption methods, user experiences, partners, platforms, content protection (DRM) and monetization systems.
A leader of people: You don’t passively observe. You embed yourself into a team, leading not from an ivory tower, but with a contagious enthusiasm people can’t help but feel while working alongside you on a project. You’re a skilled communicator who is able to present big ideas to colleagues, bosses and senior leadership, able to navigate a massive organization with swiftness and grace. 
Strategy architect: You’re a doer/thinker hybrid – the kind of bright mind who can think through numbers and data to draw meaningful insights. You know how to break down the component parts of a big, elaborate idea to chart a clear course of action for a team. You have superior analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to deliver clear recommendations with grace and candor.
Flexible: You have a flexible approach to teams and work. You understand how to keep a project moving when working with remote partners and team members across time zones.
Fast, not loose: You move a million miles a minute – not because someone told you to – but because you don’t know how to work any other way. You’re prepared to juggle multiple responsibilities, deadlines and personalities in a fast-paced environment focused on quality, adapting swiftly to a changing landscape. Your track record of delivering key digital projects on time and in budget reflects this enthusiasm.
A lifelong learner: You’re deeply interested in the digital product landscape. You’re a generalist at heart with broad exposure to a variety of user experience disciplines, like interaction design, usability engineering, research & analytics and visual design.

Business Wire




May 9, 2016 11:26 AM EDT













 




























































  Time Inc. (NYSE:TIME) today named Kurt Rao to the newly created position of Senior Vice President, Technology Operations. Rao, former VP and Corporate CIO of Time Warner Inc., will be responsible for leading the company's technology operations and infrastructure to continue to support Time Inc.'s digital strategy and technology platforms. Jen Wong, Time Inc. President of Digital, will assume oversight of product development and engineering. Both appointments are effective immediately. Time Inc. Chief Technology Officer Colin Bodell will be leaving the company.  The company also announced that as part of Time Inc.'s focus on leveraging the combined media and data assets of its newly acquired Viant subsidiary, Dr. JT Kostman will also be leaving the company.  Chairman and CEO Joe Ripp said, "Kurt has a proven record of providing vision and implementing strategic technology solutions for complex organizations. At the same time, moving product development and engineering under Jen's oversight will expedite the advancement of our digital assets. I want to thank both Colin and JT for the contributions they have made that have enabled us to arrive at this point."  Wong will continue to report to Ripp. Rao will report to EVP and CFO Jeff Bairstow.  Rao has extensive experience working at large media companies on software development and managing infrastructure operations that support critical business functions. He was VP and Corporate CIO of Time Warner Inc. since 2007, having previously served as Vice President of Technology at NBC Universal. He has also worked at Vivendi, IAC Interactive and MTV Networks.

She joined the company in January in the new role of President of Digital and oversees the company's digital and interactive strategies and operations. Each month Time Inc. reaches more than 150 million unique visitors via digital devices on a global scale. Before joining Time Inc., she led PopSugar Inc.'s business operations, engineering and growth strategy for media and commerce. Wong previously held several executive management positions at AOL, where she oversaw global business operations, and AOL Huffington Post Media Group's lifestyle portfolio of brands. She also worked at McKinsey in the consultancy firm's telecom, media and technology practices.

  equal opportunity to qualified people with disabilities1.  To help us
  measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or
  if you ever had a disability.  Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you
  will choose to fill it out.  If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be
  kept private and will not be used against you in any way.


  If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way.
  Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our
  employees to update their information every five years.  You may voluntarily
  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.

How do I know if I have a disability?

  You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or
  medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a
  history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Disabilities include, but are not limited to:

Blindness
Deafness
Cancer
Diabetes
Epilepsy
Autism
Cerebral palsy
HIV/AIDS
Schizophrenia
Muscular dystrophy
Bipolar disorder

Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair
Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)


Disability Status
Please selectYes, I have a disability (or previously had a disability)
No, I don't have a disability
I don't wish to answer

Reasonable Accommodation Notice

  Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified
  individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation
  to apply for a job or to perform your job.  Examples of reasonable accommodation
  include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing
  documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using
  specialized equipment.


1Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  For more
  information about this form or the equal employment obligations of Federal contractors,
  visit the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
  (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.

Leading Portfolio of Mobile and Digital Tools for Family Organizing



NEW YORK, June 2, 2014 – Time Inc. announced today that it has acquired Cozi Inc., a Seattle-based technology company with a leading portfolio of mobile and digital family organizing tools. Terms were not disclosed.


Cozi was launched in 2005 by former Microsoft and Amazon executives with a vision for creating technology that brings families together. Today, the company is a leader in the digital family organization and calendar space with more than 10 million users who manage day-to-day family activities with Cozi’s suite of products.


“Cozi is a terrific fit for Time Inc.," said Joe Ripp, Time Inc. Chairman and CEO. "It immediately extends our product and technology portfolio. At the same time, it gives us a new product development hub as well as a foothold in the rapidly growing productivity category. Robbie Cape and his team have built a dynamic business that will ultimately help us engage our audiences more deeply."


“Cozi is an asset that can be leveraged across our entire brand portfolio,” said Time Inc. Executive Vice President, Evelyn Webster, who will have responsibility for Cozi. “Its organizational tools naturally align with the more than 53 million families we reach every month through brands like Real Simple and we believe its products can have a wider application. We are excited to combine our rich and diverse content with Cozi’s technology platform and see a great opportunity to grow this business.”


“It’s a match made in heaven,” said Robbie Cape, CEO of Cozi. “Our expertise in the mobile and family technology space coupled with Time Inc.’s incredible brands, content and reach—I could not imagine a better fit.”


Founded by CEO Robbie Cape, a former Microsoft General Manager, Cozi is a technology company dedicated to simplifying everyday life, easing communication and connecting busy families. Its signature product, Cozi Family Organizer, has more than 10 million users and is the leading solution for busy families to manage schedules and activities, track grocery, shopping and to do lists, plan meals and store recipes, organize household chores and keep family memories.


The product is accessible across multiple platforms and is advertiser supported. Cozi Gold, the company’s premium subscription product, offers users expanded features. With the acquisition, Real Simple Publisher Charlie Kammerer will take responsibility for Cozi advertising management working closely with Cape.


About Time Inc.


Time Inc. is one of the largest branded media companies in the world reaching more than 130 million consumers each month across multiple platforms. With influential brands such as TIME, PEOPLE, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, InStyle, REAL SIMPLE, Wallpaper, Travel + Leisure and Food & Wine, Time Inc. is home to celebrated events and franchises including the FORTUNE 500, TIME 100, PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED's Sportsman of the Year, the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen and the ESSENCE Festival.
