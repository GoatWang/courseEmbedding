I can say this having tried out many other chiropractic and wellness centers across DFW, some with success and others not so much, but the Doctors Hall (Mike and Cara) are truly in a league of their own. They are both genuinely caring people who enjoy educating, spreading wellness, and building a community in addition to treating chiropractic issues. I often see whole families come in together for chiropractic care. The office itself is clean, well decorated and provides a warm relaxing atmosphere.I have been a patient of  Dr. Mike Hall for about 17 years and he is not just a great chiropractor, but also a great man. He initially rehabbed me after a very serious car wreck in which I was rear ended at a stop light. I was diagnosed with whiplash, stretched spinal cord and concussion. I was in so much pain I could barely move or speak. I had constant headaches.Dr. Hall was gentle, patient and caring. He treated me in the office and gave me exercises to do at home to facilitate my recovery. He empowered me to take charge of my own well being.Prior to Dr. Hall I had seen chiropractors regularly for about ten years. I am an active person had recurrent neck/shoulder/rib problems for many years. Each visit would provide temporary relief, yet I'd develop pain again increasingly over the next days and weeks until I absolutely had to see the chiropractor again. After the rehab with Dr. Hall I noticed that I didn't have the recurring (what I called "the flaming sword" between my shoulder blades) something that I had begun to think was going to be a life long burden.A major criticism about chiropractic is that you need to constantly go to appointments, otherwise your pain will return. Let me be the first to tell you that's not the case. Making the investment in the expertise of Dr. Hall and doing my part with home care (exercise and nutrition) is the best thing I could have ever done for my health.I continue to visit him from time to time for maintenance, when I have an issue or when I just want to immerse myself in a loving, nurturing, positive environment. I always leave breathing easier with a smile on my face. He has worked with me on all my medical issues, suggesting supplements and workouts for my various needs. I am always treated with respect and kindness by Dr Hall, his wife, Cara, and their staff.I recommend family, clients and friends to Hall Chiropractic and Family Wellness Center because I know they will receive the best care possible.Posture Perfect Wellness Centerrbrenmore ratedI finally found a place where ...I finally found a place where the doctors actually care about the patients. I was diagnosed with a back problem years ago the pain was getting so bad that it has been difficult for me to pick up my kids without shooting pain and then soreness afterwards, I recently moved back to Dallas and needed to find a good Doctor to help me with my problem. I was looking for a place that took my insurance and lucky for me I was referred here. I have never been to a place like Posture Perfect Wellness Center before,  they took a different approach to treating me. I was worked on by 3 doctors who came up with a treatment plan together. It was really different watching the doctors discuss how they were going to put a plan together specifically for me utilizing Chiropractic, Physical Therapy and Medical Care. In that first visit I learned more about my condition "Sciatica/ Disc herniation" and the cause of it , I also learned about my treatment options and the risk of possible surgery if this condition gets worse. The doctors explained to me everything I needed to know on the types of treatments for this problem and tailored a program with me that would fit my lifestyle in order to get better step by step.   I think that this is the future of healthcare and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for more of a comprehensive clinical approach to their health. Today was my 5th treatment I received a Deep Tissue Massage, Chiropractic Treatment and Physical Therapy. I have to say that this is the best I have felt in years.  If you are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the stiffness, pain, and body aches I have found the place for you.  5+******Advanced Wellness & Rehab CenterChiro A. rated5.0 star rating 6/9/2014There is not enough space here to write, in detail, of the Positive experience I've had with Dr. Adorable and his staff at the Advanced Wellness and Weight Loss clinic. Having no prior experience with Chiropractors, I was a little skeptic at first, to say the least. All I was sure of was the Severe pain I was in, and the need for relief. After 3 trips to the ER and getting pumped full of drugs, only to have the pain return the following day, I was desperate! A CT Scan showed severe bulging of the lower discs of my spine which was placing pressure on the Sciatic nerve. On a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was a 10+. After having Dr. Adorable review my medical files and filling him in on my history of injuries, he reassured me that he could offer some (if not total) relief from the pain. After 4 weeks of having him make "adjustments" to my spine, and Spinal Decompression treatments, the pain went from a 10+ to a 1. As I sit here now writing this it is a 0! NO PAIN whatsoever!! He is not one to fill you full of false hopes. His honesty in the possibilities of helping my situation was reassuring. I still have several sessions to go before completing the recommended treatment. I would like to thank him and his Wonderful staff for giving me my life back! And Yes, his staff is Superb! From his massage therapist to his receptionist; they are Awesome! Let me close by saying that being a person of great faith, and praying for an answer/remedy to my condition, I Know that God worked through Dr. Adorable to bring about my healing. And for that, I can't thank Either enough!Adorable Chiropractic ClinicSamuel K. ratedThere is not enough space here to write, in detail, of the Positive experience I’ve had with Dr. Adorable and his staff at the Advanced Wellness and Weight Loss clinic.

Posture Perfect Wellness Centercynthiacrystals ratedI have been an athlete all my ...I have been an athlete all my life and when I injured my lower back playing basketball I was not going to let that stop me. I originally went into see my doctor and he referred me to an orthopedic surgeon luckily the first thing he told me was that I should do conservative treatment and if that did not work he would recommend surgery. I found Posture Perfect online, I liked the fact that all of the clinicians working at the facility were either former athletes or still playing sports, also I was really impressed with the fact that they had a comprehensive approach to treating patients. I was able to see the Physical Therapist, the Medical Pain Management specialist and the Chiropractor.  I think it took about 2 weeks for the pain to be completely gone. I am still seeing the massage therapist the personal trainer and Chiropractor for more active care but I have to say that I feel so much stronger and healthier than I have in years.  I have referred many family members, friends and coworkers to Posture Perfect and I would highly advise anyone who is suffering from old athletic injuries, back pain, headaches, or any other condition involving pain to go there.Spinalworks DallasLinda W. ratedFriendly, relatable Drs. w/ a genuine interest in your overall well-being. They take time to listen to your goals/concerns. You never feel you're being rushed through/a bother. Also never feel you're trying to be sold something you don't need. Their chief practice is correcting postural problems.They do a thorough examination of your spine and posture & tell you any issues. Then, provide several options for care. Typically, it's 1-treatment to fix issue the best way possible, 2-treatment to manage issue, 3-come in as needed. You don't feel pushed into one or the other, they merely present the information/options and let you come to whatever decision works for you. They also are very transparent about the costs and break it down so you can understand the what and why, as well as explaining how your particular insurance plan works--which is extremely helpful and refreshingly UNshady. They want you to receive the best care for the money and the office offers varying types of paymentPosture Perfect Wellness CenterTomer P. ratedI'v been living in Dallas for the past few years and like to get my back adjusted every once in a while, usually after some kind of a home improvement project it seems. I was not picky at first since most of the places I ended up in did an ok job but Posture Perfect has consistently sent me home feeling great and better educated about my posture and wellness in general. I leave there on a high every time! I am 45 now, I always wanted to improve my posture and when I go for a few consecutive visits I actually see a difference in the way I stand and sit at the office. I love that they get me to pop without too much pressure, it means they know what to move and they don't just force it. It feels healthy and the results last longer every time I go. I love the new setup and the wellness approach which makes it feel a little more casual and less like a forced appointment with my doctor. It is properly named a wellness center and I can't wait for my next visit. Thank you!Posture Perfect Wellness Centercbigler ratedI am 36 years old and occasion...I am 36 years old and occasionally suffer from a car accident where I was broad-sided (t-boned) when I was 19 years old. It keeps me from doing heavy exercises without pain or stiffening - it's definitely manageable, but annoying at times. I went in and met with Dr Lohr and his staff; I really liked the team at Posture Perfect - all very nice folks that made me feel at home! They too me through the entire clinic explaining what will be done to help lessen the pain and I was adjusted by Dr Long. Seeing X-Rays of my spine and neck was kind of cool, but also helped me understand where some of my issues are. I'll definitely do a follow-up visit and am looking forward to learning more about proper nutrition / diet from Dr. Lohr. If you have issues and recurrent pain from a car accident, then I recommend seeing these guys! You'll be glad you did!The Joint ...the chiropractic placeSandra K. ratedI've been seeing Chiropractors for over 25 years and have learned a lot about the therapy. Dr. Forrest Askew is a great fit for my specific spinal adjustment needs. He is very good with Anterior adjustments (you're on your back when he adjusts the spine) and he is able to adjust the T1/C7 (the joint between the neck bones and the upper back) that i have troubles with because of working too many hours at the computer. I have a good dr in Irving but he's an hour away and doesn't work weekends. I've been trying to find a dr. in the Dallas area for a couple of years now without much luck. Dr. Askew, I'm so glad i decided to give The Joint another try.Posture Perfect Wellness Centertamarajohn ratedI was in an accident and I was...I was in an accident and I was very soar, my low back and neck were very tight. When I went to see my doctor he reffered me to go see Dr. Long and Dr. Vo. I was afraid at first because I've never seen a Chiropractor before or a Physical Therapist. Overall I am very please with the service I received I feel soo much better and I feel as if my quality of life has improved. I am currently seeing the personal trainer at the clinic 2x a week and getting massaged once a month. I have lost over 30 lbs. I would highly reccomend Posture Perfect Wellness Center to anyone who is in pain or wants to improve their life.

Article Title
Jesus and Tiberius:  An Examination of Source Reliability



Page Range
2-17



Keywords
Jesus, Tiberius, Gospels, Historiography



Abstract
Since the introduction to the critical method of studying the Old and New Testament in the nineteenth century, doubt has been thrown on the historical reliability of the biblical narrative accounts, especially the four Gospels. Yet, far less scrutiny and denigration have been applied to historical sources written during the time of the Roman Empire. A comparison, then, is proposed. It would be beneficial to compare the sources that detailed the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, namely, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John and the four sources which chronicled the life of Tiberius, emperor of the Roman Empire during the Ministry of Jesus. How do the sources compare as to their composition in proximity to their subject? Do the sources agree with one another? Is there a level of objectivity in the sources that allowed them to present the correct details of their subject? These questions will determine the reliability of the documents in question and whether the four Gospels measure up to critical examination.
