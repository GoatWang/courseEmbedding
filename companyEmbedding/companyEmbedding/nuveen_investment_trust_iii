LEGAL BACKGROUND                                                                
----------------                                                                

     In accordance with the rules and requirements of the Investment Company Act
  of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Nuveen Investments, and
each of its affiliated companies, has adopted this Code of Ethics and 
Reporting Requirements (the "Code") to guard against violations of the
    standards set forth in the above rules.  In addition, the Code establishes
guidelines for the conduct of persons who:                            

    (1)  may obtain material non-public information concerning securities held
  by or considered for purchase or sale by any series of Nuveen-
       sponsored registered managed funds (open-end and closed-end funds),
      Nuveen defined portfolios (unit investment trusts) and any managed
          accounts to which Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Asset Management Inc.,
 Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp., Nuveen Senior Loan Asset
  Management Inc. or Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. act as
investment advisers; or                                     

 (2)  may make any recommendation or participate in the determination of
         which recommendation shall be made concerning the purchase or sale of
         any securities by a Nuveen managed fund, defined portfolio or managed
      account. Persons subject to this Code are also subject to Nuveen's
Policies and Procedures Designed to Prevent Insider Trading.

I.   PURPOSE OF THE CODE                                                        
-------------------                                                   

A. The Code establishes guidelines for Nuveen employees, officers,    
   directors and members of their immediate families in the conduct of their
personal investments and is designed to:                              

1 

P-->EX-99.P2nd�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
     .  forbid transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission or other
regulatory bodies would view as illegal, such as front-running; 

    .  avoid situations where Nuveen employees, officers, directors or members
of their immediate family, and any Nuveen managed fund, defined 
      portfolio or managed account, had personally benefited, or appeared to
       benefit, at the expense of a managed fund, defined portfolio or managed
        account shareholder or client, or taken inappropriate advantage of their
fiduciary positions; and                                        

.  prevent, as well as detect, the misuse of material, non-public     
information.                                                    

B. Employees, officers and directors should be aware that Nuveen's    
reputation could be adversely affected as the result of even a single 
     transaction considered questionable in light of the fiduciary duties we owe
 to Nuveen's managed funds, defined portfolios and managed accounts.  It
  bears emphasis that technical compliance with the Code's procedures will
    not automatically insulate from scrutiny transactions which show a pattern
  of abuse of the individual's fiduciary duties to a managed fund, defined
portfolio or managed account.  In addition, a violation of the general
principles of the Code may subject an individual to sanctions.        

II.  Definitions                                                                

A.  "Access Person" - You are an Access Person if your job normally   
---------------                                               
involves any of the following:                                

  .  The purchase or sale of "Covered Securities" (as defined below) for
Nuveen managed funds, defined portfolios or managed accounts. 

.  In connection with your regular functions or duties, you make,   
         participate in, or obtain information regarding the purchase or sale of
    Covered Securities by a managed fund, defined portfolio or managed
        account, or your functions relate to the making of any recommendations
   with respect to the purchases or sale of such Covered Securities.

.  You have access to information regarding the purchase or sale of 
     Covered Securities for managed funds, defined portfolios or managed
accounts.                                                     

  In addition, you are an Access Person if you are any of the following:

.  A president, vice president or director of Nuveen Advisory Corp.,
        Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp., Nuveen Asset Management or Nuveen
Senior Loan Asset Management Inc.                             

.  "Investment Personnel" or a "Portfolio Manager" as defined below.

(NOTE:  A list of persons deemed to be Access Persons of the various entities 
subject to this Code is attached as Exhibit A)

     B. "Investment Personnel" - Investment Personnel are portfolio  managers,
----------------------                                        
         financial analysts, C. investment analysts, traders and other employees
       of Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp., Nuveen

         Management Inc., Nuveen Senior Loan Asset Management Inc. or Nuveen
       Investments entrusted with direct responsibility and authority to
           make investment decisions affecting a managed fund, defined portfolio
       or managed account. Portfolio Managers are also deemed Investment
Personnel and Access Persons by definition.               

    D.  "Interested Director" - An Interested Director of a fund is a director
---------------------                                         
       who has a material business relationship or professional relationship
     with a managed fund, investment adviser or underwriter of the fund.
        Generally, Interested Directors are those that are employed by any one
        of the above entities. (See Investment Company Act, Section 2(a)(19).)

    E.  "Covered Security" - A Covered Security is any stock, bond, debenture,
-----------------                                           
        evidence of indebtedness or in general any other instrument defined as
      a security in Section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
except that it does not include:                              
-------------------------------                               

       1)   Direct obligation of the Government of the United States or of
               agencies of the U.S. Government that are backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. Government;                

       2)   Bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial
           paper and high quality short-term debt instruments, including
repurchase agreements; and                        

3)   Shares issued by open-end investment companies.        

     F.  "Purchase or Sale" - includes any transaction in 2.  which a beneficial
------------------                                            
       interest in a security is acquired or disposed of, including, but not
      limited to, the writing of an option to purchase or sell a security.

G. "Beneficial Ownership"                                             
----------------------                                          

 1) Generally:  Beneficial Owner means any person who, directly or
----------                                                
indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,   
      relationship or otherwise has or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary
interest in a security. The term                                

3 

P-->EX-99.P4th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
  pecuniary interest means the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to
     profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject
      securities. (Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)

The pecuniary interest standard looks beyond the record owner of  
 securities.  As a result, the definition of Beneficial Ownership is
       extremely broad and encompasses many situations that might not ordinarily
be thought to confer a "pecuniary interest" in, or "ownership" of 
securities.                                                       

2) Family Holdings:  As a general rule, you are regarded as the   
---------------                                             
       Beneficial Owner of securities not only in your name but held in the name
of members of your Immediate Family.                              

Immediate Family includes:                                  
----------------                                            

.  your spouse or domestic partner;                         

         .  your child or other relative who shares your home or, although not
     living in your home, is economically dependent upon you; or

   .  any other person if you obtain from such securities benefits
substantially similar to those of ownership.          

       3) Partnership and Corporate Holdings:  A general partner of a general or
-----------------------------------                         
limited partnership will generally be deemed to Beneficially Own  
      securities held by the partnership, so long as the partner has direct or
  indirect influence or control over the management and affairs of the
partnership.  A limited partner will generally not be deemed to   
       Beneficially Own securities held by a limited partnership, provided he or
      she does not own a controlling voting interest in the partnership.  If a
corporation is your "alter ego" or "personal holding company", the
corporation's holdings of securities will be attributable to you. 

      4) Investment Clubs:  You are deemed to Beneficially Own securities held
----------------                                            
     by an investment club of which you or a member of your Immediate Family
(as defined above) is a member.                                   

     5) Trusts:  You are deemed to Beneficially Own securities held in trust
------                                                      
if any of the following is true:                                  
    - You are a trustee and either you or members of your Immediate Family
     (as defined above) have a monetary interest in the trust, whether as to
principal or income;                                              
- You have a vested beneficial interest in the trust; or          
       - You are settlor of the trust and you have the power to revoke the trust
    without obtaining the consent of all the beneficiaries.  See Rule 16a-
1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)

P-->EX-99.P5th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
Securities Deemed not to be "Beneficially Owned"                  
------------------------------------------------                  

Beneficial Ownership does not include:                            

    -  securities held in the portfolio of a registered investment company
       solely by reason of an individual's ownership of shares or units of
such registered investment company;                         
  -  securities purchased via an automatic dividend reinvestment plan;
-  securities purchased via a rights of accumulation plan;        
      -  securities held by a pension or retirement plan holding securities of
          an issuer whose employees generally are the beneficiaries of the plan.
  However, your participation in a pension or retirement plan is
          considered Beneficial Ownership of the portfolio securities if you can
        withdraw and trade the securities without withdrawing from the plan.

    H.  "Security Held or to be Acquired" by a managed fund, defined portfolio
---------------------------------                             
or managed account means:                                     

 1.  Any Covered Security which, within the most recent 15 days:
             a)   is or has been held by the managed fund, defined portfolio
or managed account; or                  
               b)   is being or has been considered by the managed fund, defined
portfolio or managed account; and       

       2.  Any option to purchase or sell, and any security convertible into
or exchangeable for, a Covered Security.              

III. Exempted Transactions (applicable to all employees)                        
---------------------                                                 

     The trading prohibitions or restrictions listed in Section IV below of this
Code shall not apply to the following transactions:                   

A.  Nuveen open-end fund purchases or redemptions.                    

B.  Purchases or redemptions of shares of investment companies from   
sponsors other than Nuveen.                                   

C.  Purchases or sales of direct obligations of the U.S. Government or
 Government agencies; bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of
         deposit, commercial paper and high quality short-term debt instruments,
including repurchase agreements.                              

    D.  Purchases or sales effected in any account over which the party has no
         direct or indirect influence or control (e.g., assignment of management
                        ----
       discretion in writing to another party). Employees will be assumed to
have influence or                                             

5 

P-->EX-99.P6th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
     control over transactions in managed accounts they Beneficially Own
 unless they have certified otherwise in their Initial Holdings,
Quarterly Transaction and Annual Holdings Reports.            

  E.  Purchases or sales that are non-volitional on the part of either the
      individual involved or a managed fund or managed account client, for
example, securities obtained through inheritance or gift.     

    F.  Purchases which are part of an automatic dividend reinvestment plan or
       similar automatic periodic investment process or when issued pro rata
      to all holders of a class of securities, such as stock splits, stock
 dividends or the exercise of rights, warrants or tender offers.
     However, these transactions should be reported by Access Persons in
their Quarterly Transaction and Annual Holdings reports once  
acknowledgement of the transaction is received.               

 G.  Purchases or sales of equity securities issued by companies with an
  equity market capitalization of at least $1 billion, unless such
       securities appear on an applicable blackout list (Rittenhouse, Nuveen
   Senior Loan Asset Management, Defined Portfolios). However, these
      transactions should be reported by Access Persons in their Quarterly
     Transaction and Annual Holdings reports once acknowledgement of the
        transaction is received. Transactions in securities of The John Nuveen
Company are NOT exempted transactions under this section.     

    NOTE:  The fiduciary principles set forth in Section I apply to all of the
above-described transactions.                                         

IV.  Prohibited or Restricted Purchases and Sales                               

A.   All Nuveen Employees                                             
---------------------                                       

        1.  Prohibition of purchases of IPOs.   No employee may purchase any
         securities in an initial public offering (IPO) other than an offering
of municipal securities or U.S. Government securities.      

       2.  Pre-clearance of certain transactions.   Unless previously pre-

     B.   Access Persons (including Portfolio Managers and Investment Personnel)
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        In addition to the requirements set out in paragraph A above, Access
       Persons of the types specified in each paragraph are subject to the
following additional requirements:                          

     1.   No Trades When A Managed Fund or Managed Account has Pending
"Buy" or "Sell" Order.                            

          No Portfolio Manager or Investment Personnel shall execute a
            securities transaction on a day during which a managed fund or
             managed account of a type identified on Exhibit A or B for that
         individual has a pending "buy" or "sell" order in that same
           security until that order is executed or withdrawn.  No other
           Access Person shall execute a securities transaction on a day
          during which a managed fund or managed account has a pending
             "buy" or "sell" order in that same security until that order is
               executed or withdrawn, if that person knows, or reasonably should
              have known, an order is pending.  The preceding two sentences do
               not apply to securities transactions involving a security held by
              a managed fund or managed account and invested and managed under
             a sub-advisory agreement unless the person has actual knowledge
          that the fund or account has a pending "buy" or "sell" order
involving such security.                          

       2.   No Trades within Seven Days of Managed Fund or Managed Account
Trades.                                           

               No Portfolio Manager or Investment Personnel of a managed fund or
            managed account may purchase or sell any security within seven
               calendar days before or after the managed fund or managed account
             of a type identified on Exhibit A for that individual trades or
            considers to purchase or sell such security.  This prohibition
               does not apply to securities that are invested or managed under a
           sub-advisory agreement unless the person has actual knowledge
           that the fund or account has traded or is considering a trade
involving such security.                          

       3.  No Trades in Securities on the Defined Portfolio Blackout List.

     No Access Person for Defined Portfolios shall execute a
              securities transaction in any security contained on the blackout
           list for Defined Portfolios in effect from time to time.  The
            blackout list for a portfolio will be issued approximately two
               weeks prior to the deposit date (or such later time the portfolio
              is set) and will remain in effect until seven days following the
deposit date.  A second

the close of business on the termination date.    

         4.   Pre-clearance of Trades in Securities Identified as Eligible for
Purchase.                                         

           Portfolio Managers and Investment Personnel of Nuveen managed
             funds and managed accounts must pre-clear, prior to purchase or
             sale, fixed-income and equity securities identified as eligible
       for purchase or sale for a fund or product for which they
individually have some significant responsibility.

5.   Profits on Purchases and Sales within 60 Days.         

             Portfolio Managers and Investment Personnel may not profit as a
           result of a purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, within a
               period of 60 calendar days, of the same (or equivalent) security,
               if such security is held by a managed fund or managed account for
           which they individually have some significant responsibility.

       exchange-traded fund are subject to the provisions of Section 16 of
         the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, must pre-clear all trades in any
        exchange-traded fund for which they serve as a Section 16 officer or
director.                                                   

D.   Nuveen Senior Loan Asset Management Exchange-Traded Funds

E.   Non-Interested Fund Directors                                    

         Non-interested directors (as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940) of the Funds are:                                     
    .   permitted to purchase or sell securities in IPOs and private
---------                                           
placements;                                         

        .   prohibited from purchasing securities of The John Nuveen Company
----------

8 

P-->EX-99.P9th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
     .   subject to the pre-clearance requirements of Section VI below
-----------------------------------------           
            regarding purchases or sales of 1) equity securities with public
      equity market capitalization less than $1 billion, if such
        director has actual knowledge that such securities are being
         considered for purchase or sale by a Fund; and 2) shares of a
           Nuveen-sponsored exchange-traded fund for which they serve as a
director or trustee.                                

V.   Additional Prohibited Activities                                           
--------------------------------                                      

A.   Acceptance of Gifts:                                             
-------------------                                         

         Nuveen employees should not accept any gift from any person or entity
   that does business with or on behalf of a managed fund, defined
    portfolio or managed account.  For purposes of this prohibition,
     "gift" has the same meaning as that expressed in Rule 2830 of the
         National Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rules.  Therefore,
        a gift may not have a market value of more than $100.  Employees are
     not prohibited from accepting non-cash compensation in the way of
       entertainment, including meals and tickets to cultural and sporting
        events within certain limits.  Please refer to Nuveen's policies and
procedures located on the Legal/Compliance website for more 
         information concerning the receipt of cash and non-cash compensation.

B.   Service as Directors:                                            
--------------------                                        

        Access Persons are prohibited from serving on boards of directors of
         publicly traded companies absent prior authorization from an attorney
     in the Legal Department based upon a determination that the board
         service would be consistent with the interests of defined portfolios,
  managed funds or managed accounts.  Access Persons who receive
    authorization to serve as board members must be isolated through
    "Chinese Wall" procedures from those investment personnel making
  investment decisions regarding securities issued by the entity
involved.                                                   

VI.  Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions                                   
----------------------------------------                              

A.   In General:                                                      
-----------                                                 

         As noted in Section IV above, certain securities transactions require
         pre-clearance prior to purchase or sale, or prior to the placement or
     rescission of a self-executing order. The affected individual may
     obtain pre-clearance from the paralegal responsible for reviewing
         personal securities trading (currently, Ginny Johnson) or an attorney
in the Legal Department.  The                               

9 

P-->EX-99.P10th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
        request for pre-clearance may be made orally or in writing. Requests
for pre-clearance must include the following information:   

.  issue name;                                              
.  ticker symbol or CUSIP number;                           
.  type of security (bond, stock, note, etc.);              
.  maximum expected dollar amount of proposed transaction;  
         .  nature of the transaction (purchase, sale or self-executing order)

     The paralegal or attorney reviewing the transaction will make note of
  the outcome in a written or electronic report. If authorization is
       granted, Legal will provide the individual with a written record in the
   form attached as Exhibit B. The affected individual will have three
       business days to execute an approved transaction at market, or to place
 or cancel a self-executing order. Failure to execute the approved
     transaction within three business days will require the person to re-
    submit their pre-clearance request as described above. The automatic
execution of an order does not require additional pre-clearance.

B. Private Placements:                                                
-------------------                                             

        Requests from employees for approval to purchase securities offered in a
    private placement must be submitted in writing to an attorney in the
      Legal Department prior to placing an order to purchase the securities.
       Unless specifically exempt under section III above, no such transaction
   may be effected without prior clearance. The attorney reviewing the
    transaction will take into account, among other factors, whether the
  investment opportunity should be reserved for a defined portfolio,
    managed fund or managed account and whether the opportunity is being
offered to an individual by virtue of his or her position.      

C. JNC Stock:                                                         
---------                                                       

     Employees and directors must pre-clear all market transactions in JNC
        stock with an attorney in the Legal Department. The following procedures
also apply:                                                     

        1.  Blackout period. Employees may not engage in market transactions
---------------                                     
             in JNC stock during the period from the first day of any calendar
          quarter until two full business days have passed following the
           public release of earnings for the prior quarter, or during any
             other announced blackout period. Persons subject to Section 16 of
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are subject to certain
           additional blackout periods. This prohibition does not apply to
             non market transactions such as the exercise of JNC stock options
          through the delivery (constructive or otherwise) of previously
          owned JNC stock to pay the exercise price and tax withholding.

10

P-->EX-99.P11th�Page�of�25TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
          2.  Short-term trading. Employees may not engage in short-term trading
------------------                                  
              activity in JNC stock. Jumping in and out of the market may create
the appearance of insider trading.                  

     3.  Options and short selling. Employees may not engage in option
-------------------------                           
              transactions related to JNC stock (other than JNC-issued options),
             and may not engage in any transactions where they would profit if
the value of JNC shares fell, such as short sales.  

 4.  Encouraging others' trades. No employee should in any way
--------------------------                          
            encourage others to engage in transactions in which the employee
him- or herself cannot engage.                      

VII. Reporting Requirements

          confirmations and copies of periodic statements (quarterly reports) of
        all securities transactions in their accounts, with the exception of

          instruction for broker-dealers to direct the duplicate confirmation is
 attached as Exhibit C, or may be obtained from the designated
 paralegal (currently, Ginny Johnson) in the Legal Department.

     Please note that a "broker-dealer" includes both of the
following:                                        

            A broker or dealer with whom a securities brokerage account is
maintained in the employee's name; AND

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
