ESG Statement

Past performance is not indicative of future results.1 Metrics presented use pre-determined criteria to measure each individual investment product based on its ability to either A) rank above the median of its peer category; or B) outperform its benchmark index on a gross-of-fees basis. Generally speaking, the results for unconstrained, fully-active investment products were based on relevant peer category rankings while those of "enhanced index", rules-based, risk-constrained, or client-specific investment products were based on benchmark-relative performance. Metrics are calculated on an annualized basis and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only) commercial book of business that remain open as of 3/31/17. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns and peer medians is Voya Investment Management but is based in part on data from Morningstar (mutual funds) and eVestment (institutional composites). Further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.2 Metrics are based on observations of rolling 3-year annualized returns over the last 30 months, calculated on an annualized, gross-of-fees basis, and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only commercial book of business that remain open as of 3/31/2017. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns is Voya Investment Management, and further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.3 Pensions & Investments magazine, The Largest Money Managers as of December 31, 20164 As of 3/31/17, Voya IM assets of $219 billion include proprietary insurance general account assets of $89 billion calculated on a market value basis.

					Why Does Total Return Matter in Private Credit?
				

Chris Lyons, Head of Private Credit



Although total return is more difficult to track for private credit offerings than it is for public bonds, the performance metric is arguably more important in the private market.
