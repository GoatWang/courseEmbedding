TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Response 3 Oct 2016 – Controller Thank you for your feedback. We are happy to hear that you are satisfied with the growth potential and career paths that are offered here at Altruista. As a rapidly growing company it is our goal tomake sure that as the company grows, our talented and valued staff grow with us as well. In reference to your concerns, Altruista is going through a lot of changes as we scale. We are aware that as we grow, certain processes and procedures might be neglected, or may simply become ineffective. We are working on improving our organization’s structure and hierarchy and are constantly seeking feedback from our employees. As with any high growth company, there will be periods of growing pains where departments will have to adjust and adopt a bit of flexibility as we are continuously striving to improve. That said, we take your concerns and advice to management seriously. We are always looking to advance and develop better internal processes. The feedback that we receive from our employees is critical to progress.... MoreLess ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC. 2016-08-21 21:54 PDT 11 Aug 2016 Helpful (3)"Good place to work in start up ,, but management is very poor"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Team Member in HyderabadCurrent Employee - Senior Team Member in HyderabadDoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookI have been working at ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC. full-time (More than 3 years)ProsWork environment is very good ... no doubt abt itEveryone are friendly and do the workConsWorst management in the upper sectionthey recruited few people who are on reference and movie started from that time onwardsdecision will be taken by them and implemneted forcibly on us to do itmore adhoc works will getNo proper respect to the experience people .... managment will support those ppl who are working from years in this company and we need to abide them at any costdont know why they recuirted us if this is the caseqa team is not up to that mark in terms of quality .... and even manager also same like thatAdvice to ManagementDont recruit ppl who came just for show up in companytrust ppl who are working for company and their careers sakehigher management is also covering issues just like that .. even harssment case so closed by giving just lollypopsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC.

Almost everyone conveyed about ad-hoc work, lack of planning stuff. But, the management is interested in bringing clients only and want resources to manage the releases somehow. This makes the team demotivated and less productive. Every time one ormore task will be at highest priority and other planned tasks will be at risk. I have seen PMs apologizing unnecessarily to the clients just because management cannot plan well, prioritize tasks, do not set unrealistic expectations with clients.When some release will happen exactly as per the plan and as per schedule, it would be a miracle in the history of Altruista.These people even do not conduct appraisals on time. This year it was delayed by around 4 months. Never the success credit is given to Offshore team, only onsite team is praised.Moreover, the resources are not good enough to satisfy current needs of the organization and hence every client is in trouble now. You will find work life balance only if you are working with a less noisy client. Otherwise, resources are not at all happy working for major and demanding clients.Advice to ManagementManagement do not care about individual's growth and career path in the organization. There is no organization structure and no career advancement. Management itself do not have proper path and vision to go ahead.Executives feel very happy when they make announcement that we have grabbed xyz client, but they cannot even think of strategy to satisfy the same client down the line after 6 months.There are few people in the organization which are the real crabs and will never let you grow.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC.

Response 10 Oct 2016 – HR Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear that you are disappointed with the management team at Altruista. During times of rapid growth, it may seem like the management team is preoccupied andunavailable. Unfortunately, this may sometimes be the case at small companies that have limited resources and are experiencing tremendous growth. Fortunately, with the addition of a significant number of new hires in both India and US, Altruista is responding to its increasing demands from clients and is working around the clock to build solid teams with senior managers that are available to their direct reports. In addition, Altruista understands that transparency is absolutely necessary for employee morale as well as team building. The Altruista management team has begun holding quarterly ‘All-Hands’ meetings to provide employees with significant milestones and company updates, as well as serve as an open forum for any questions or concerns that employees may have. In addition, Altruista’s management team is committed to upholding an open door policy and will always set aside time for employee’s comments and concerns.... MoreLess ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC. 2016-04-13 09:44 PDT Showing 16 of 16 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12NextReviews > ALTRUISTA HEALTH, INC.

To develop a proper sales force, there needs to be a focus on proper training to position your sales reps to be successful. If you are turning over a dozen employees in a single role over the course of a year, then maybe it's not the employees that are the problem, but rather your company.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Dental Health Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Dental Health Products 2017-03-31 22:02 PDT Dec 1, 2016"Good Company"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookProsFamily atmosphere, warm and friendly.

Management is ran entirely by the family. The family gets to come and go as they please. They don't follow business rules.Advice to ManagementTry to treat everyone the same and do not let the HR management talk about the sensitive information that people share there.

Employees deal with issues management should be responsible for. Absolute horrible software & ordering system. Expensive Insurance. Lack of Communication among all departments.Advice to ManagementLISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES. Don't continue to just blow them off and dismiss them as if they are easily replaceable. Stop listening to the negative long time employees who seem to have a lot of say among the office that create a lot uncomfortable working environment because management continues to back them up. Very disappointing that the good, honest, hard working employees are bullied in the office and not acknowledged when bringing issues to management.

The company is family owned by the Lizottes’s and they are all inspiring, humble, fun, caring and encouraging. Everyone is supportive, informative and terrific motivators. If looking for training, support, motivation, encouragement or just a good old reality check, it’s just a phone call away. The wisdom and expertise of my peers and leaders is shared openly and consistently. My favorite thing about working with Designs For Health is how they help you realize the best version of yourself in every way.I am extremely passionate about the product we produce and love that this company is designed to help everyone from employees to clients win! This is an exciting and rewarding adventure, I can’t thank all who make this happen enough! I have been given opportunities I wouldn’t have had at other companies, I respect our founding team and admire their values, and (perhaps most importantly) I love the people I work with. So much so that I have referred several people that have since been hired and are celebrating their one year anniversaries.Here's how you know you've made it at Designs For Health. The reward for doing a good job is getting a bigger, tougher problem next time. Meaning, you are always solving the easiest problem you will ever solve again. This takes a lot of resilience and active managing of self-expectations to remember that things are not actually getting worse, the problems are just getting harder. So my advice is to remember that. And then take a second to realize that it would be a lot less fun if the reverse were true. And isn't that precisely why you wanted this job in the first place anyway? It sure was for me.ConsThere are always going to be growing pains in any company, so I will say we have them. I value the ownership that I have in my role. I love knowing that my ideas on ways that can improve the day to day operations are valued, heard and have even been implemented. We have an exceptional team and their passion and commitment to excellence has made my experience refreshing.What I will also say is that if you as an employee just share your issues with your peers and not with your leads, supervisor, and managers it will never get past the break room.It is not always easy - but that is what makes every day challenging and rewarding at the same time.Advice to ManagementKeep up the exceptional effort working from an individual employee's strengths. We serve customers best when we all are working on something we are exceptional at, and have the drive and passion to see it through. Take time in your team’s work of learning and curiosity...this breeds the innovation you seek.Continue to find and promote the leadership that lives out our operating principles.Never lose where all this started, it is what drives all of you…it is the HEART of DFH!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Designs for Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Designs for Health 2017-06-06 10:26 PDT May 22, 2017"Great Small-Med.

Health Educators are contracted work and people know this before ever going to training. Its not an easy job and yes it has a very high turnover rate. On the same hand, some people do VERY well with it and make very good money doing it.So I have been with the company for quite some time and know who some of these reviews are being left from. And I do agree with some of what has been said, but on the same hand some of these people were just not good workers and want to blame management for it. I will agree with the people that say some people are over worked, and because of that, turnover has been a little high, but that is also due to the growth the company has encountered and not being able to get quality people hired quick enough. Also I do agree that the company is quite cliquey and certain people get away with things because they are friends with upper management. DFH is not perfect, but it also far from being as bad as some have tried to describe.Advice to ManagementListen to the employees that have been around and loyal for many years. Also stop forcing under qualified friends into the mix because it has hurt moral and the reputation of the company.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Designs for Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Designs for Health 2017-05-18 17:12 PDT May 8, 2017"Lack of support"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendDisapproves of CEOI worked at Designs for Health full-timeProsThe only pro would be free supplements.ConsUnder paid for the amount of work they expect you to doComplete disregard and lack of respect for their employees, that is why their employee turn over rate is so high and it will continue to be like that way until management takes responsibility for their actions.Extremely Short staffedShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Designs for Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Designs for Health 2017-05-08 11:38 PDT Apr 16, 2017 Helpful (2)"Oh my God!

Not sure.ConsPromises, promises. Say things will change and nothing ever does. No communication with anyone (sales reps, customers, employees); never think anything through, worst management ever - very manipulative, fear based mentality. If you are doing well, you will be their best buddy, under 100% to goal or not growing watch out; no support what so ever. They are looking out for the themselves and only themselves. Don't let them fool you saying they are looking out for customers, sales reps, employees. Latest is Amazon program where the general public is purchasing DFH products without a practitioner's consent. They are pocketing all the profits. What is the difference between this and shutting down all the Amazon sites 2 years ago and practitioners and reps losing income? Nothing is every written down so they can change the rules at anytime. For example - Baseline reduction each year you are at DFH has yet to happen which means less they have to pay in the long run. Management seems to cover for each other. If someone brings a complaint to management it seems there is an excuse or cover as if no one said anything. This has happened on several occasions with mistreatment of sales reps.Advice to ManagementWatch out. The word is out about the company. Pay attention. As fast as you built this business you can lose it. Get rid of all of management, especially Metagenics management. None of them have worked out and have changed this company drastically for the worse. Listen to what the employees are saying and don't turn your back.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Designs for Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Designs for Health 2017-04-16 07:18 PDT Mar 17, 2017 Helpful (3)"Look elsewhere"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendDisapproves of CEOI worked at Designs for Health full-timeProsThey give you a monthly allowance for supplements/vitamins.ConsDon't be fooled by the appeal of family-owned business.
