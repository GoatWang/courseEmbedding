Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Process for producing micromechanical sensors



Patent number:  6159762
                                            

Abstract:  Method for manufacturing an absolute pressure sensor as micromechanical component on a silicon substrate, whereby a cavity (4) is etched out in an auxiliary layer (3) under a membrane layer (5) through etching openings (6), the etching openings are closed with a passivation layer (7), whereby a specific etching opening (11) is re-opened in a via hole etching and this opening is re-closed with a metallization or dielectric material (10, 12) in a following process step that ensues at low pressure.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        May 27, 1999
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        December 12, 2000
                        

Inventors: 
                                                                
                                Thomas Scheiter, Christofer Hierold, Ulrich Naher
                            





Micromechanical sensor



Patent number:  6140689
                                            

Abstract:  In a relative pressure sensor or miniaturized microphone as a micromechanical sensor component, a polysilicon membrane is arranged over a polysilicon membrane of an SOI substrate. A recess that is connected to the cavity between the membrane and the body silicon layer by openings in the body silicon layer is present in the substrate on the back side. Given an excursion of the membrane, a pressure equalization can therefore occur in the cavity as a result of these openings. The measurement occurs capacitatively by electrical connection of the electrically conductively doped membrane and a doped region formed in the body silicon layer.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        December 21, 1998
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        October 31, 2000
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Siemens Aktiengesellschaft
                                

Inventors: 
                                                                
                                Thomas Scheiter, Ulrich Naher, Christofer Hierold
                            





Rotation rate sensor



Patent number:  6094985
                                            

Abstract:  Rotation rate sensor as a micromechanical component in silicon, in which a ring with a rigid strut along a diameter is so suspended at elastic braces and anchoring arrangements on a substrate as to be able to perform rotation oscillations about its center axis and to be able to be tilted about the strut under the influence of outer torques. There are electrodes present at the ring and at the substrate, at which electrodes electrical voltages can be applied such that rotary oscillations of the ring about its center axis can be excited and rotary oscillations about the strut can be detected. To stabilize the position of the ring in the neutral position, additional electrodes can be provided at the ring and at the substrate for the generation of electrostatic forces.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        May 24, 1999
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        August 1, 2000
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Siemens Aktiengesellschaft
                                

Inventors:

Semiconductor chip



Patent number:  6020050
                                            

Abstract:  A semiconductor chip has a membrane mounted on supports that are held in the material of the chip so that the membrane is supported at a space from the chip. The membrane may be a metal layer. The supports are columns or webs that extend into the chip material. Electrical connections to the membrane may be made by conductive supports.

                    Global production and purchasing operations create a platform for entry into new markets. However, it takes considerable effort to plan and implement a sustainable globalization strategy; this book will help in that task. The wealth of experience and analysis featured in this book is the result of an extensive survey among leading manufacturing companies as well as countless discussions with executives who have personally wrestled with the issues of "going global." The book treats the whole range of management challenges. In breadth and depth, the insights it offers surpass what a manager or most individual companies could acquire on their own.

Recensioner i media
    


From the reviews:  "This book, an update of the 2005 German edition, is based on interviews with 100+ managers at 54 companies in Western Europe, North America and Asia ... . The book, with a good quality touch, is filled with examples and data from companies and it has well-constructed, insightful data graphs and figures ... . I would highly recommend this book to academicians, consultants and practitioners or anyone who would like to know more about the inner workings of global production networks." (Gyula Vastag, International Journal of Production Research, Vol. 47 (19), October, 2009)
