Hemmingway would be envious of this tropical four bedroom, four bath waterfront estate. Fully remodeled, this home was recently expanded to include the spacious master suite & living room, new custom dock, heated pool and spa, and two car detached garage with over 500' of second story additional storage or recreation space. Recent property upgrades included new wiring, plumbing, metal roof and full impact windows. Soaring pelicans, dolphins, and manatees are your quiet neighbors here on Dinkin's Bayou. Enjoy some of Sanibel's most spectacular sunsets from this premier location. This private and peaceful area was homesteaded by steamboat engineer, Josiah Dinkins, in 1898. The boating lifestyle on this natural waterway, with access to gulf and bay, is complimented by the amenities of nearby Sanctuary Golf Club and the beaches of Blind Pass and Bowmans Beach.

#StylistTip from @hairbyshawna_russell:
Painting is a passion, you control and you design... V's are a great blending technique and use of lightness and depth in one section. I use light pressure with my brush strokes but a good amount of lightener for saturation laying on top , tension on my section and my fav painting brush @framarint . Downward light strokes for the sides and a lot of times upwards strokes to blend the middle | Shown on my work bestie @beautymark_hair_by_nicole💋
