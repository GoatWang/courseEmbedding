Turning uncertainty into growth







Building more resilient societies







Enhancing health and wealth around the world







Realizing the promise of emerging technologies

Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify new opportunities by addressing the full range of risks, facilitating capital flows, and overcoming barriers to investment.

 





Political Risk
Marsh is facilitating capital flows to emerging economies by showing investors how they can protect themselves from political upheaval, violence, and default, so infrastructure and commerce can bloom in regions where enterprise is needed most.








Terror
Guy Carpenter is helping insurers assess terrorism risks with the latest tools and techniques to generate realistic models of potential damage so coverage keeps up with an evolving threat.








Workforce
Mercer is developing powerful new analytic tools that enable business leaders to predict what and where skills will be needed — and how to develop or find the required talent — as their organizations expand and enter new arenas.








Urbanization
Sustainability experts at Oliver Wyman are designing strategies to help new megacities around the world meet unprecedented demand for infrastructure and develop logistics solutions to support ever-greater flows of food, freight, water, and waste.








M&A
Mercer is helping cross-border mergers and acquisitions generate returns sooner by resolving complex cultural, operational, and regulatory issues.





 




Marsh & McLennan Companies collaborates with global industries, NGOs and governments to identify shared risks, preserve critical resources, and advise on long-term investments.

 





Shared Solutions
Marsh is helping business leaders and public officials explore shared solutions to shared climate risks to power, transportation, and communications. The logic is simple: business continuity is community continuity.








Impact Investing
Mercer is advising institutional investors how to incorporate environmental, social, and corporate governance factors into their investment decisions so portfolios reflect organizational and societal values as well as market value.








Capital
Securities experts at Guy Carpenter are pioneering the use of catastrophe bonds that spread the economic impact of natural disasters among investors as well as insurers, increasing resilience in affected areas while lowering coverage costs.








Energy
Energy experts at Oliver Wyman are working with the World Energy Council to identify common needs of both producers and governments. The result is a remarkable consensus on a transformation agenda for sustainable energy.








Cities
Environmental risk specialists at Marsh are accelerating the reclamation and redevelopment of urban brownfields, helping cities transform derelict industrial sites into high-value locations and hubs for employment.




 





Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients manage the world’s most important resource, people, by improving healthcare outcomes and long-term financial security.

 





Exchanges
Mercer is creating flexible private health insurance exchanges that give US employees and employers greater choice and more flexible coverage while reducing complexity and cost.








World Health
Experts at Oliver Wyman are helping global health organizations analyze supply and demand for critical vaccines and map the most efficient distribution strategies to protect populations in every corner of the developing world.








Workplace Safety
Marsh Risk Consulting is improving job safety for millions of workers by helping employers benchmark progress towards health and safety goals across their operations around the world, including the performance of supply chain partners.








Innovation
Guy Carpenter is developing advanced analytics to help insurers prepare for the risks that their customers fear most and designing innovative products that enable them to grow profitably and confidently in the face of uncertainty.








Outcomes
Marsh is helping hospitals and healthcare providers create safer patient environments to improve outcomes while reducing the number and severity of malpractice claims.




 




Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify increasingly interconnected risks and implement enterprise solutions to make technology secure and productive.

 





Volatility
Guy Carpenter experts are helping clients make sense of cyber portfolio volatility, structuring reinsurance solutions that provide them with adequate protection as this threat continues to emerge.








Cyber Risk
Oliver Wyman is helping clients evolve from today's untenable “IT fortress” approach to cyber security to a cost-benefit approach that manages cyber risks like other operational risks, factors them into strategic decision-making, and uses forward-looking scenario analysis rather than historical data.








Threat Modeling
Marsh innovated to develop a new analytic tool that enables organizations to predict the likelihood of data breaches and their costs, including forensic investigation, lawsuits, and fines. Company-specific inputs help users model potential threats with confidence.








Transactions
Marsh is analyzing cyber attacks in the retail industry to help merchants, banks, insurers, and regulators get together on better protections for consumers and the economy.








Agility
Oliver Wyman is helping clients reduce the complexity of technology systems and processes in large organizations. By going “back to the future,” our clients discover their operations are more nimble and more robust.

Scott McDonald on the Politicization of Business
Amid profound social, technological and economic change, “businesses cannot avoid becoming political,” says Scott McDonald, Oliver Wyman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, in a recent article in Harvard Business Review. As businesses have responded to “the direct, market-based risks presented by major economic, technological, and demographic trends,” they have not addressed “secondary, nonmarket risks—which may turn out to be even greater.”

Our Founders' Stories
Colleagues describe the founders of Marsh & McLennan Companies as "restless spirits" who saw vast new opportunities in the challenges of their times and moved with dispatch to seize them.












Henry Marsh and Donald McLennanThe power of complementary personalities


Henry W. Marsh dropped out of Harvard to seek his future in Chicago. The Great Fire of 1871 had wiped out most insurers and Marsh saw opportunity for insurance brokers that could distribute great risks across many firms. Almost upon arrival, his ambitions were bigger than the new company he joined. Marsh wanted to open an office in New York. Then he set out to win U.S. Steel, the world's first billion-dollar corporation. Colorful, urbane, high living, and audacious, Marsh was the kind of man who would book a transatlantic passage so he could pitch AT&T's Theodore Vail aboard ship. On Vail's return voyage, there was Marsh again. He got the business.
Donald R. McLennan of Duluth, Minnesota, became his family's sole support at age 14. In business life, his intense competitiveness took the form of thoroughness. McLennan was all diligence, researching insurance clients' operations until he knew as much as the owners. During 1901, while Marsh was pursuing U.S. Steel, McLennan was mastering the intricacies of railroads, winning one line after another. He spent weeks at a time inspecting every property along thousands of miles of road — a man who believed in research, and in seeing for himself.
When the two men merged their firms in 1904, the new company was the largest insurance agency in the world with annual premiums of US$3 billion — and it was only the beginning.



Guy CarpenterThe power of data

In the American south of the early 20th century, cotton was a major industry. But cotton insurance — young Guy Carpenter's area of interest and business — was haphazard and reactive. Bad years sent premiums rocketing out of growers' reach. Lucky years sent premiums down, exposing insurers to huge risks.
Like other Marsh & McLennan Companies founders, Carpenter looked at the business before him and saw a better way. His insight: quantitative analysis of losses over time could reveal the signal within the noise of year-to-year fluctuations. For the first time, producers and insurers could anticipate rates and manage costs. The insight that data — the more the better — could help clients anticipate perils and measure risks put Guy Carpenter on a trajectory that is still transforming the industry. In 1921, Guy Carpenter met Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan during a transatlantic crossing. Guy Carpenter & Company would become part of Marsh & McLennan and take the nascent science of analytics far beyond cotton.



William MercerThe power of customization

In 1944, William Mercer was a young economist at Canada's Powell River Company, then one of the world's largest paper manufacturers. Mercer was assigned to design a pension plan for the company, and he came to the task as the objective economist he was. He had no preconceptions about what kind of plan it should be, and instead worked out from scratch the most beneficial scheme possible for Powell River's people, whom he thought of as his clients.
The difference between his plan and those that were commercially available led him to launch his own pension consulting business a year later with $25 of his own and a $100 loan. In 1949, Mercer's firm joined Marsh & McLennan, which had created an employee benefits area of expertise in 1938. William Mercer's legacy can be seen across Marsh & McLennan Companies today. Mercer believed in hiring the brightest people he could find, and in objective, clean-sheet-of-paper analysis of the challenge at hand. The best answer is always better than a good answer, no matter how well 'good' has worked before.



Alex Oliver and Bill WymanThe power of specialization

In 1984, Alex Oliver and Bill Wyman saw that the landscape of business was about to change in fundamental ways. Deregulation and privatization of financial services, communications, and other industries around the world meant that CEOs would need more than better ways to run their companies; they'd need clarity on the future, whole new business models, and multifaceted strategies to implement change while continuing to make the most of their current businesses. 
And, because entire industries were changing, they'd need deeply specialized advisors — people who wouldn't need to be educated about the client's world because they'd lived it. Oliver and Wyman left partnerships at Booz Allen Hamilton to set up a company to deliver this new kind of advice for organizations in dynamic environments.
Thirty years on, as industries continue to evolve, Oliver Wyman is an advisor (and employer) of choice for leaders who would rather be change agents than fast followers.



 
 









We Remember & Honor
On September 11, 2001, 295 colleagues and 63 consultants working in our offices were lost in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. They were loved ones, good friends, and valuable colleagues, and their memory — and legacy — will live forever in our hearts.

What's in Store for Marsh & McLennan (MMC) in Q2 Earnings?


July 25, 2017, 10:15:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. Last quarter, Marsh & McLennan surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.09%. Moreover, the company beat earnings estimates in two out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.76%.    Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement   Factors Influencing Q2 Results    We expect the company's second-quarter's results to showcase strong performance at both its segments - Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting - driven by an improving global economy which is perking up economic activity. However, the company commented that given the better-than-expected first-quarter top line, growth might get tempered in the second quarter, resulting in modest margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services.    The company is quite aggressive in making acquisitions, which constitutes an important part of its capital allocation strategy. The synergistic effect of a number of purchases made by the company over the past many quarters will lead to revenue accretion.    Growth initiatives undertaken by the company will contribute to overall results. Some of these include -  expansion in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, Marsh's buildout of MMA and its UK SME strategy, the emergence of cyber, flood and mortgage practices at Marsh and Guy Carpenter, investments at Mercer in Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange, investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform, and the pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and public sector.    The company has undertaken restructuring initiatives which will cause it to incur related charges.    Also, foreign exchange movement might have a slight negative impact on earnings.    Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS     Surprise      Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. Quote   Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marsh & McLennan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.   Zacks ESP:  Marsh & McLennan has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.00 per share is in line the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  ..   Zacks Rank:  Marsh & McLennan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   Stocks That Warrant a Look    Here are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:      Fiserv, Inc. FISV  is expected to report second-quarter earnings results on Aug 1. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.63% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .    CNA Financial Corp. CNA  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company will report second-quarter earnings results on Jul 31.    Financial Engines, Inc. FNGN  has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. It will report second-quarter earnings results on Aug 1.

Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify new opportunities by addressing the full range of risks, facilitating capital flows, and overcoming barriers to investment.

 





Political Risk
Marsh is facilitating capital flows to emerging economies by showing investors how they can protect themselves from political upheaval, violence, and default, so infrastructure and commerce can bloom in regions where enterprise is needed most.








Terror
Guy Carpenter is helping insurers assess terrorism risks with the latest tools and techniques to generate realistic models of potential damage so coverage keeps up with an evolving threat.








Workforce
Mercer is developing powerful new analytic tools that enable business leaders to predict what and where skills will be needed — and how to develop or find the required talent — as their organizations expand and enter new arenas.








Urbanization
Sustainability experts at Oliver Wyman are designing strategies to help new megacities around the world meet unprecedented demand for infrastructure and develop logistics solutions to support ever-greater flows of food, freight, water, and waste.








M&A
Mercer is helping cross-border mergers and acquisitions generate returns sooner by resolving complex cultural, operational, and regulatory issues.





 




Marsh & McLennan Companies collaborates with global industries, NGOs and governments to identify shared risks, preserve critical resources, and advise on long-term investments.

 





Shared Solutions
Marsh is helping business leaders and public officials explore shared solutions to shared climate risks to power, transportation, and communications. The logic is simple: business continuity is community continuity.








Impact Investing
Mercer is advising institutional investors how to incorporate environmental, social, and corporate governance factors into their investment decisions so portfolios reflect organizational and societal values as well as market value.








Capital
Securities experts at Guy Carpenter are pioneering the use of catastrophe bonds that spread the economic impact of natural disasters among investors as well as insurers, increasing resilience in affected areas while lowering coverage costs.








Energy
Energy experts at Oliver Wyman are working with the World Energy Council to identify common needs of both producers and governments. The result is a remarkable consensus on a transformation agenda for sustainable energy.








Cities
Environmental risk specialists at Marsh are accelerating the reclamation and redevelopment of urban brownfields, helping cities transform derelict industrial sites into high-value locations and hubs for employment.




 





Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients manage the world’s most important resource, people, by improving healthcare outcomes and long-term financial security.

 





Exchanges
Mercer is creating flexible private health insurance exchanges that give US employees and employers greater choice and more flexible coverage while reducing complexity and cost.








World Health
Experts at Oliver Wyman are helping global health organizations analyze supply and demand for critical vaccines and map the most efficient distribution strategies to protect populations in every corner of the developing world.








Workplace Safety
Marsh Risk Consulting is improving job safety for millions of workers by helping employers benchmark progress towards health and safety goals across their operations around the world, including the performance of supply chain partners.








Innovation
Guy Carpenter is developing advanced analytics to help insurers prepare for the risks that their customers fear most and designing innovative products that enable them to grow profitably and confidently in the face of uncertainty.








Outcomes
Marsh is helping hospitals and healthcare providers create safer patient environments to improve outcomes while reducing the number and severity of malpractice claims.




 




Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify increasingly interconnected risks and implement enterprise solutions to make technology secure and productive.

 





Volatility
Guy Carpenter experts are helping clients make sense of cyber portfolio volatility, structuring reinsurance solutions that provide them with adequate protection as this threat continues to emerge.








Cyber Risk
Oliver Wyman is helping clients evolve from today's untenable “IT fortress” approach to cyber security to a cost-benefit approach that manages cyber risks like other operational risks, factors them into strategic decision-making, and uses forward-looking scenario analysis rather than historical data.








Threat Modeling
Marsh innovated to develop a new analytic tool that enables organizations to predict the likelihood of data breaches and their costs, including forensic investigation, lawsuits, and fines. Company-specific inputs help users model potential threats with confidence.








Transactions
Marsh is analyzing cyber attacks in the retail industry to help merchants, banks, insurers, and regulators get together on better protections for consumers and the economy.








Agility
Oliver Wyman is helping clients reduce the complexity of technology systems and processes in large organizations. By going “back to the future,” our clients discover their operations are more nimble and more robust.

Scott McDonald on the Politicization of Business
Amid profound social, technological and economic change, “businesses cannot avoid becoming political,” says Scott McDonald, Oliver Wyman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, in a recent article in Harvard Business Review. As businesses have responded to “the direct, market-based risks presented by major economic, technological, and demographic trends,” they have not addressed “secondary, nonmarket risks—which may turn out to be even greater.”

History[edit]
Burroughs, Marsh & McLennan was formed by Henry W. Marsh and Donald R. McLennan in Chicago in 1905. It was renamed as Marsh & McLennan in 1906.
The reinsurance firm Guy Carpenter & Company was acquired in 1923, a year after it was founded by Guy Carpenter. In 1975, it acquired the human resources consulting firm Mercer. In 1997, it bought Johnson & Higgins. Shortly after, it bought Sedgwick.[6]
On October 11, 2001, Marsh established a crisis consulting practice specializing in terrorism, with Ambassador L. Paul Bremer as Chairman. Marsh also announced a partnership with Control Risks Group to provide political risk assessment.
In 2003, it purchased the consultancy business Oliver, Wyman & Company and merged these with some of the consultancy businesses from previous acquisitions, particularly the Mercer business under the brand name of Oliver Wyman.
On July 8, 2004, Marsh completed the acquisition of Kroll Inc.[7] Jeffrey W. Greenberg called it an important strategic step. The company had employed terrorism expert John O'Neill, formerly of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On October 14, 2004, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced the initiation of a civil action against Marsh, alleging impropriety in the steering of clients to insurers with whom the company maintained payoff agreements, and for soliciting rigged bids for insurance contracts from the insurers. The Attorney General announced that two AIG executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with this illegal course of conduct and stated, "There is simply no responsible argument for a system that rigs bids, stifles competition and cheats customers." CEO Jeffrey W. Greenberg resigned several weeks later. The suit was ultimately settled out of court.
On January 31, 2005, Marsh & Mclennan agreed on an $850-million settlement for its bid-rigging practices.[8]
In July 2007, Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. was ranked first in Business Insurance's world's largest brokers list.[9] In August 2007, Marsh completed the sale of its Putnam Investments division to Great-West Lifeco Inc., a financial services holding company controlled by Canada-based Power Financial Corp. after it settled charges of market timing.[10] On September 14, 2007, Brian M. Storms, the CEO of Marsh's insurance brokerage unit, resigned. As Michael G. Cherkasky explained his departure, "we now need a different set of leadership and operational skills".[11]
September 11 attacks[edit]
At the time of the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the corporation held offices on eight floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, from 93 to 100.[12] When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the building, their offices spanned the entire impact zone, from floors 93 to 99.[13] Everybody present in the offices at the time of the attack died as all stairwells at impact zone were destroyed/blocked by the plane crash, and the firm lost 295 employees and 63 contractors.[1] (Cantor Fitzgerald is the only company to have lost more in the attack.)
Operating segments and subsidiaries[edit]
Marsh & McLennan Companies is composed of two primary business segments: Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting.[14]

Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify new opportunities by addressing the full range of risks, facilitating capital flows, and overcoming barriers to investment.

 





Political Risk
Marsh is facilitating capital flows to emerging economies by showing investors how they can protect themselves from political upheaval, violence, and default, so infrastructure and commerce can bloom in regions where enterprise is needed most.








Terror
Guy Carpenter is helping insurers assess terrorism risks with the latest tools and techniques to generate realistic models of potential damage so coverage keeps up with an evolving threat.








Workforce
Mercer is developing powerful new analytic tools that enable business leaders to predict what and where skills will be needed — and how to develop or find the required talent — as their organizations expand and enter new arenas.








Urbanization
Sustainability experts at Oliver Wyman are designing strategies to help new megacities around the world meet unprecedented demand for infrastructure and develop logistics solutions to support ever-greater flows of food, freight, water, and waste.








M&A
Mercer is helping cross-border mergers and acquisitions generate returns sooner by resolving complex cultural, operational, and regulatory issues.





 




Marsh & McLennan Companies collaborates with global industries, NGOs and governments to identify shared risks, preserve critical resources, and advise on long-term investments.

 





Shared Solutions
Marsh is helping business leaders and public officials explore shared solutions to shared climate risks to power, transportation, and communications. The logic is simple: business continuity is community continuity.








Impact Investing
Mercer is advising institutional investors how to incorporate environmental, social, and corporate governance factors into their investment decisions so portfolios reflect organizational and societal values as well as market value.








Capital
Securities experts at Guy Carpenter are pioneering the use of catastrophe bonds that spread the economic impact of natural disasters among investors as well as insurers, increasing resilience in affected areas while lowering coverage costs.








Energy
Energy experts at Oliver Wyman are working with the World Energy Council to identify common needs of both producers and governments. The result is a remarkable consensus on a transformation agenda for sustainable energy.








Cities
Environmental risk specialists at Marsh are accelerating the reclamation and redevelopment of urban brownfields, helping cities transform derelict industrial sites into high-value locations and hubs for employment.




 





Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients manage the world’s most important resource, people, by improving healthcare outcomes and long-term financial security.

 





Exchanges
Mercer is creating flexible private health insurance exchanges that give US employees and employers greater choice and more flexible coverage while reducing complexity and cost.








World Health
Experts at Oliver Wyman are helping global health organizations analyze supply and demand for critical vaccines and map the most efficient distribution strategies to protect populations in every corner of the developing world.








Workplace Safety
Marsh Risk Consulting is improving job safety for millions of workers by helping employers benchmark progress towards health and safety goals across their operations around the world, including the performance of supply chain partners.








Innovation
Guy Carpenter is developing advanced analytics to help insurers prepare for the risks that their customers fear most and designing innovative products that enable them to grow profitably and confidently in the face of uncertainty.








Outcomes
Marsh is helping hospitals and healthcare providers create safer patient environments to improve outcomes while reducing the number and severity of malpractice claims.




 




Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify increasingly interconnected risks and implement enterprise solutions to make technology secure and productive.

 





Volatility
Guy Carpenter experts are helping clients make sense of cyber portfolio volatility, structuring reinsurance solutions that provide them with adequate protection as this threat continues to emerge.








Cyber Risk
Oliver Wyman is helping clients evolve from today's untenable “IT fortress” approach to cyber security to a cost-benefit approach that manages cyber risks like other operational risks, factors them into strategic decision-making, and uses forward-looking scenario analysis rather than historical data.








Threat Modeling
Marsh innovated to develop a new analytic tool that enables organizations to predict the likelihood of data breaches and their costs, including forensic investigation, lawsuits, and fines. Company-specific inputs help users model potential threats with confidence.








Transactions
Marsh is analyzing cyber attacks in the retail industry to help merchants, banks, insurers, and regulators get together on better protections for consumers and the economy.








Agility
Oliver Wyman is helping clients reduce the complexity of technology systems and processes in large organizations. By going “back to the future,” our clients discover their operations are more nimble and more robust.

Scott McDonald on the Politicization of Business
Amid profound social, technological and economic change, “businesses cannot avoid becoming political,” says Scott McDonald, Oliver Wyman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, in a recent article in Harvard Business Review. As businesses have responded to “the direct, market-based risks presented by major economic, technological, and demographic trends,” they have not addressed “secondary, nonmarket risks—which may turn out to be even greater.”

The reinsurance firm Guy Carpenter & Company was acquired in 1923, a year after it was founded by Guy Carpenter. In 1975, it acquired the human resources consulting firm Mercer. In 1997, it bought Johnson & Higgins. Shortly after, it bought Sedgwick.[6]

History[edit]
Burroughs, Marsh & McLennan was formed by Henry W. Marsh and Donald R. McLennan in Chicago in 1905. It was renamed as Marsh & McLennan in 1906.
The reinsurance firm Guy Carpenter & Company was acquired in 1923, a year after it was founded by Guy Carpenter. In 1975, it acquired the human resources consulting firm Mercer. In 1997, it bought Johnson & Higgins. Shortly after, it bought Sedgwick.[6]
On October 11, 2001, Marsh established a crisis consulting practice specializing in terrorism, with Ambassador L. Paul Bremer as Chairman. Marsh also announced a partnership with Control Risks Group to provide political risk assessment.
In 2003, it purchased the consultancy business Oliver, Wyman & Company and merged these with some of the consultancy businesses from previous acquisitions, particularly the Mercer business under the brand name of Oliver Wyman.
On July 8, 2004, Marsh completed the acquisition of Kroll Inc.[7] Jeffrey W. Greenberg called it an important strategic step. The company had employed terrorism expert John O'Neill, formerly of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On October 14, 2004, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced the initiation of a civil action against Marsh, alleging impropriety in the steering of clients to insurers with whom the company maintained payoff agreements, and for soliciting rigged bids for insurance contracts from the insurers. The Attorney General announced that two AIG executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with this illegal course of conduct and stated, "There is simply no responsible argument for a system that rigs bids, stifles competition and cheats customers." CEO Jeffrey W. Greenberg resigned several weeks later. The suit was ultimately settled out of court.
On January 31, 2005, Marsh & Mclennan agreed on an $850-million settlement for its bid-rigging practices.[8]
In July 2007, Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. was ranked first in Business Insurance's world's largest brokers list.[9] In August 2007, Marsh completed the sale of its Putnam Investments division to Great-West Lifeco Inc., a financial services holding company controlled by Canada-based Power Financial Corp. after it settled charges of market timing.[10] On September 14, 2007, Brian M. Storms, the CEO of Marsh's insurance brokerage unit, resigned. As Michael G. Cherkasky explained his departure, "we now need a different set of leadership and operational skills".[11]
September 11 attacks[edit]
At the time of the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the corporation held offices on eight floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, from 93 to 100.[12] When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the building, their offices spanned the entire impact zone, from floors 93 to 99.[13] Everybody present in the offices at the time of the attack died as all stairwells at impact zone were destroyed/blocked by the plane crash, and the firm lost 295 employees and 63 contractors.[1] (Cantor Fitzgerald is the only company to have lost more in the attack.)
Operating segments and subsidiaries[edit]
Marsh & McLennan Companies is composed of two primary business segments: Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting.[14]
Risk and Insurance Services[edit]

Marsh, which provides insurance broking and risk management consulting. Peter Zaffino has been the president and CEO since 2011
Guy Carpenter, a risk and reinsurance intermediary

Consulting[edit]

Mercer, offering health, retirement, talent, and investment consulting services;
Oliver Wyman Group, a collection of management consulting firms (including Oliver Wyman, formerly Mercer Management Consulting, Mercer Oliver Wyman, and Oliver Wyman Delta, as well as Lippincott and NERA Economic Consulting)

Management[edit]

President, CEO: Dan Glaser (since Jan 1, 2013)
Chairman: H. Edward Hanway (non-executive Chairman, 2016–present)

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
