Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background  

The Eco-Products Fund will be jointly managed by Equator Environmental LLC and New Forests Inc.  Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:  implementing partners, best practices information.
OFFERING:  financial resources, implementing partners, best practices information, media and marketing assistance.


Progress Reports

July 2008
The current flagship program of the commitment is the Duck's Unlimited Avoided Grassland Conversion Project in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The goal of the DU Avoided Grassland Conversion project is to protect the Prairie Pothole Region (of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana) by placing perpetual conservation easements to avoid conversion to cropping. The Project aims to protect 30,000 acres by the end of 2009.
Milestones Reached:
- Currently, over 10,000 acres have been placed under easement or are pending acceptance by the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
- To date, the National Fish and Wildlife Service has never rejected any of Equator Environmental's proposed easements.

[+] Dice rolls










Stéphane PARRIN
(Perikles42)

















Wars Across The World (WAW) is a strategy game for all platforms (pc, tablets, smartphones, and boardgames). The Kickstarter campaign started October 15th, 2015. - Link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waw/wars-across-the-wor...WAW has a unique game concept and system that allows to recreate with ONE RULE ALL types of conflict that occured, from prehistorical times to our days, with traditional warfare and assymetrical conflicts WAW will be released in Spring 2016 with a first collection of at least 16 titles for the first year.An ingame editor will be included with the PC version to edit all the game elements.- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvSnYQW2OnI- Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/waw.strategiaePresentation by one of the authors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB2ToysLcPA- Website with all information: http://www.waw-games.com/The game concept is detailed here: http://direct.waw-games.com/le-concept-waw/How to simulate all conflicts of mankind with a single game system? Many feel it is not possible, but the games we have actually made show it is! The base rules in the WAW engine/system allow to recreate military operations at the general and common level: movement management, stacking, combats, income, supply, production, etc…  Those rules works all the time and do not need to be learnt over and over. So the learning curve is rather flat and fast.  For modern wars, air rules and armor warfare are also generic, although obviously made OFF in games scenarios before the modern era. Then each scenario has a set of limited specific rules that will fit with the time period or environment played. All the games events in a scenario are unique and assigned to each of the player, and leaders and combat or support units are also unique for each side (or the nations making one side).  Example 1: you can attack only with stacks with leaders (except for sieges and naval/air war), so managing leaders are crucial, and they are not so many. Their combat values affect battle dices, their morale values affect the battle outcome (by influencing the number of sustainable hits). Example 2 (continued): combat works by having each unit in a stack roll a ‘dice’ and score equal (panic inflicted) or less (hit inflicted) than their combat value. This roll is modified by leader’s combat difference (if any), terrain modifiers, supports (air, artillery) and some event cards played during the battle…panicked unit no longer fight in a second round but will suffer pursuit losses. Hit unit lose one step. Number of hits (influenced by army/leader morale values and possibly cards play) determine who wins or loses. A Scenario example! In the game Normandy 1944, movement, supply, combat and production all use the generic WAW rules, and then we have extra rules for German bunkers, Mulberries, railroad sabotage, the Bocage, naval support. And the air rules (generic) are also active.  Unique events are treated using some of the generic rules and some specific ones, and we have scripted events likes Operation Perch, German panzer ace Wittmann, DUKW, straffing of Rommel’s vehicle, French resistance, etc…  Among the units, the US 29th or 8th Infantry divisions, the 709th German ID or the 2nd SS Panzerdivision, the 4th Canadian armored, B-26 bombers, Luftwaffe land units, paratroops…  all using a system of standard attack/defense value, morale value, movement value, and special combat types…all of which are generic rules in the system.. Leaders like the Americans Gerow or Cook, Dempsey or Ritchie for the British, or the Germans like Dollmannn or Rommel, and many others… here again using the combat value, morale value etc…as per the system generic rules. Yes, ONE rule covers 90% of all instances, and in such a way the same system will be extremely familiar to players…and then each scenario/game will be unique because the look, the feel, the content, the custom and special rules and cards will lend it a special and original flavour!

I thought Gettysburg was too fiddly but I loved the command structure.  And I like the old Gamma 3 games they acquired (Quebec, 1812, Napoleon).  However, they have been in something of a rut, just cranking out Hammer clones that seem stuck on that one system.  I wish they would expand out and do something fresh like they did with Eastfront.Because of that, I think Worthington has surpassed them.  Their games are fresh from game to game.  Prussia's Defiant used a really cool combat system and card play.  Caesar's Gallic War added a Herman-style Card Driven element.  Now, they have been on a roll.  The Holdfast games are game-changers.  The American Revolution games are a lot of fun.  Wilderness Empires is a really sharp looking game.  All of these games use different systems, yet keep the rules really short.  The Civil War games appear to be using another system different from the others, but designed for the Civil War.

It used to be the case that any game from Columbia was an auto-buy, but they've had a lot more uneven performance lately.  It's only a theory, but I think some of it has to do with their embracing Kickstarter.  In a couple of cases, I think they have rushed development and made some poor decisions because of Kickstarter deadlines and stretch goals that altered the games and left them with significant errata and play issues needing further post-publication adjustment.  As for Worthington, I think some of the games are fine but I've been disappointed by a couple as well.  As block games tend to be expensive, it's a tough call whether to get swept up in the Kickstarter frenzy or to wait for market feedback and be sure.  I'm tending to let the Kickstarters go by more and more, even if I will miss some fancy component upgrade or whatever.

						There is a thread or two here and there about "What you want or expect in a wargame? or "What improvements do you see in the future for wargames."  Something like that.   Well one comment that has arisen was the quality of game boxes.  We all understand that better quality components means higher game costs.  I like Worthington games and own several, but I must say that the game boxes for HoldFast: Russia 1941-1942 and HoldFast:  Korea 1950-1951 are some of the flimsiness in my collection.  And these games were not cheap.  I am so afraid of the structural weakness of the boxes that I cannot stack them except on top . . . of a sturdy GMT game box or an old AH bookcase game.To be fair, Columbia's box quality has dropped significantly from the old Gamma Two editions to the point that I do not care for them, but they are still more durable than the two games I have already mentioned.

						Columbia's recent Victory in Europe does a lot of justice to its name. The fact that Craig Besinque left the partnership hurts the quality but Grant Dalgliesh is picking up things. The company maybe steering back on the right track. With past record like EastFront II and Julius Caesar, I still have confidence in the company and the series.

The atrocious rules, the designer literally saying on the forum "Play it this way until I hear back from someone at Columbia." seems to indicate that the right and left hands do not know what they are doing. Not inspiring. Purely conjecture on my part but I would hazard a guess they rushed KS production of Victory in Europe simply to get it out before Craig's Triumph & Tragedy which they knew would be arriving soon due to P500 numbers and product updates. From the rule book alone, T&T does what ViE wanted to do so much better. And yes to be fair T&T is not perfect, and has its bit of errata. However, at least Craig is not online going "Play this way until I hear back from GMT."

						Speaking of components, Worthington Games is not a company I'm rushing out to purchase from. Prussia's Defiant stand had a really good sturdy box. The game was interesting and though I sold it, I would like to reaquire it. My complaint is component quality. I hate, repeat, I hate the cut and fold cardboard maps. Give me paper or give me mounted, but please stop with the cardboard. Heart's and Minds Vietnam is the only current Worthington game I own, and I'm selling it. The box is so flimsy and easily suffers damage. It has the aweful cardboard map and thin flimsy cards. The counters are fine quality wise but graphically are nothing to write home about. When I see the preorder prices for their new stuff I just cannot commit to that. I'll be watching for Vance and Duke to share their thoughts about the new stuff once they get things opened and played. Until then though, color me cautious.

						wow, a lot of feedback there.i haven't pulled the trigger on any of Columbia's kickstarters, though Napoleon was tempting.  i agree with Judd, it would be nice to see them do something new with the genre.  nevertheless, they have a solid catalog, all still in print except for Pacific Victory, which would be a perfect candidate for a ground-breaking new treatment, imho.one correction, Gamma2 IS Columbia, Tom Dalgliesh ran both.  i speculate that he formed Columbia when he moved from the Vancouver area to Blaine, Washington.  Gamma was a Canadian company and Columbia is American.  just guessing.  Here's a bit of the story:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Gamesas for Worthington, other than the ACW offering, i haven't seen anything that's has grabbed my attention enough to give one a go. and some of the feedback here hasn't encouraged me to dip my toe in the waters.  blockgames ARE pricey.

These CSW ones look intriguing.cheersI like them better.  I like Eastfront, Rommell, and Hammer of the Scots (and Hammer's many clones).  I thought Gettysburg was too fiddly but I loved the command structure.  And I like the old Gamma 3 games they acquired (Quebec, 1812, Napoleon).  However, they have been in something of a rut, just cranking out Hammer clones that seem stuck on that one system.  I wish they would expand out and do something fresh like they did with Eastfront.Because of that, I think Worthington has surpassed them.  Their games are fresh from game to game.  Prussia's Defiant used a really cool combat system and card play.  Caesar's Gallic War added a Herman-style Card Driven element.  Now, they have been on a roll.  The Holdfast games are game-changers.  The American Revolution games are a lot of fun.  Wilderness Empires is a really sharp looking game.  All of these games use different systems, yet keep the rules really short.  The Civil War games appear to be using another system different from the others, but designed for the Civil War.As a second opinion, I would say "it depends".  It used to be the case that any game from Columbia was an auto-buy, but they've had a lot more uneven performance lately.  It's only a theory, but I think some of it has to do with their embracing Kickstarter.  In a couple of cases, I think they have rushed development and made some poor decisions because of Kickstarter deadlines and stretch goals that altered the games and left them with significant errata and play issues needing further post-publication adjustment.  As for Worthington, I think some of the games are fine but I've been disappointed by a couple as well.  As block games tend to be expensive, it's a tough call whether to get swept up in the Kickstarter frenzy or to wait for market feedback and be sure.  I'm tending to let the Kickstarters go by more and more, even if I will miss some fancy component upgrade or whatever.Worthington's ACW offering, above, is a Kickstarter.  After I lost my money in the UpFront saga, I don't do Kickstarters anymore.

From the rule book alone, T&T does what ViE wanted to do so much better.Yes, the rules of Victory in Europe as published were poorly written. But version 1.1 came out soon afterwards and those rules are fine - they've cleared up most of the ambiguities. VIE was certainly not rushed out - it was several months from the end of the KS campaign to the game being published. If anything, people were impatient for the game to reach them, though personally I'd rather wait a bit longer if it means a better game. Having said this, GMT is trying even my patience with Won by the Sword (more than a year after publication and we're still waiting for the various issues to be resolved...) And waiting a long time is not a guarantee of a great game - I still remember the interminable wait for MMP's Kingdom of Heaven, which didn't quite deliver what I'd been expecting.I think that T&T is a significantly different game to VIE - apart from the theme and the use of blocks, there is not much similarity. T&T is a relatively quick-playing 3-player game with a mix of military and other aspects (diplomatic, technological). Indeed, I've had a game of T&T with hardly any conflict due to a surprise attack by the Germans inflicting a rapid military defeat on the Soviets. VIE is essentially 2-player, much longer, more involved and focuses on the military.

Also ViE is not quick, as you have pointed out Scott. Which is the exact opposite of what it was billed as. It was all over their KS page, as being THE quick playing entire ETO block game. Its not, sadly.

Is it too much to ask for a product to be fully developed before the KS campaign begins?

When I see one of those, I don't mind waiting.

When I see one of those, I don't mind waiting.The designer has a dream which starts the whole project and according to C3i #26 most developers on wargame projects don't make a dime.  I completely understand that KS cash needs to go to artists to begin prettying up the project and for the physical production of the game.  But if there is still any need fo play testing after the KS fund has begun none of the factors selling the product are necessarily true.  Two hour playing time, huh?  How do you know?
