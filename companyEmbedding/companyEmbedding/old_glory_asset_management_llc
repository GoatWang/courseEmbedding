Large Cap Core Portfolios
Large Cap Core portfolios  are managed by Numeric Investors, LLC, an investment firm based in  Boston, Massachusetts.  Numeric's investment philosophy is based on the belief that, in the aggregate, markets are efficient and real economic performance drives returns.  However, over certain time periods, markets are inefficient. Specifically, Numeric attempts to exploit market inefficiencies related to security valuation, earnings momentum and earnings quality.  Click here for more information.
 
Small Cap Growth Portfolios
Small Cap Growth portfolios  are managed by Conestoga Capital, an investment firm based in Wayne,  Pennsylvania.  Conestoga believes that  investors can earn a premium return in small capitalization growth equities by  identifying higher quality companies that are capable of growing through  multiple business cycles.  They seek to  take advantage of the inefficient discovery process for small companies and  other investors' focus on near-term earnings.

Large Cap Growth Portfolios
Large Cap Growth portfolios are managed by JAG Capital Management.  JAG Capital Management is an investment firm based in  St. Louis, Missouri.  JAG believes that  companies that post faster earnings than their peers will realize superior  stock performance.  JAG seeks to own  fundamentally-sound companies that have strong management teams and  well-positioned product lines.

Large Cap  Value Portfolios
Large Cap  Value portfolios are  managed by Carl Domino, Inc., an investment firm based in West Palm Beach,  Florida.  Carol Domino is a value-yield  manager.  They believe that yield  analysis and fundamental research can identify inefficiencies that may exist in  the market.  Constructing well  diversified portfolios of undervalued, dividend-yielding securities provides an  opportunity to exploit these inefficiencies while controlling risk.

Core Fixed Income Portfolios
Core Fixed Income portfolios are managed by Ameritas  Investment Partners, an investment firm based in Lincoln, Nebraska and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Amertias' core fixed income strategy is  centered on the belief that successful fixed income investing requires finding  the best relative value through a disciplined process that emphasizes risk  management and fundamental research.

Enhanced Core Fixed Income Portfolios
Enhanced Core Fixed Income portfolios  are managed by JAG Capital Management.  JAG looks  for securities that present the best relative value based on credit and sector  analysis.  Their “bottom-up” approach to  fixed income portfolio management allows them to uncover unique opportunities  by analyzing the credit quality and valuation characteristics of securities and  identifying the most attractive candidates for purchase.  They strive to hold securities to maturity or  call. Click here for more information.
 
International Large Cap Value
International Large Cap Value portfolios are managed  by Manulife Asset Management an investment firm based in Boston, MA.   Manulife believes that long-term excess investment  returns can be achieved through stock selection (rather than sector rotation)  by investing in securities that are trading at a discount to normalized  valuations and selling when securities are fully valued. Consistent returns can  be achieved through risk reduction and stock diversification. Click here for more information.

Sub-Adviser Selection  Process
 
Old Glory Asset Management  utilizes both quantitative and qualitative screens to select our stable of  sub-advisers.  The sub-advisers utilized  by Old Glory Asset Management must meet the following criteria:
 
Performance
    Past investment performance must  be superior when compared to the appropriate benchmark and peer group  universe.  Consistency of investment  returns over a market cycle is also a must.
 
Investment Philosophy and Process
    The sub-adviser must have a  well-articulated investment philosophy and process.  This process must be disciplined and have  been consistently applied over a number of years.  
 
Low Turnover of Investment Professionals
    The portfolio management teams of  our sub-advisers are experienced and stable.   We seek out sub-advisory firms that offer a team approach to portfolio  management as opposed to a “lone-wolf” decision maker.  
 
Strong Business Fundamentals
    Old Glory Asset Management affiliates  with SEC registered investment advisory firms.   Our sub-advisers must have at least $200 million in assets under  management.  Further, they have to  demonstrate a desire to grow and expand their product offerings and client  base. 
 
Ongoing Sub-Adviser  Oversight
 
Old Glory Asset Management visits  the offices of our sub-advisers to “kick the tires” and perform due-diligence  checks.  Old Glory and its’ affiliated  sub-advisers are in frequent contact via phone, email and facsimile. 
 
Old Glory continually reviews the  investment performance, organizational and personnel stability of our  affiliated sub-advisers.  Any  significant, detrimental change in these factors would result in an immediate  reevaluation of the sub-advisory relationship and client notification.
 
At the client level, portfolio  holdings and performance are monitored by Old Glory on a monthly basis.  In addition, the sub-advisers are required to  complete a quarterly questionnaire which indicates the status of compliance  with the client’s investment guidelines.   Any deviation from the client’s investment guidelines will be  immediately addressed and rectified.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
