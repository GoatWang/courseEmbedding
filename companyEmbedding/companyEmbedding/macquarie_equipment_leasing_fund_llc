Disclosures
Legal Disclosures
True to our mission, we encourage you to read the following policies and learn how they affect you as a client.
 
(1) 24 hours:
Fast approvals and 24 hour funding subject to receipt of required documentation, underwriting guidelines, and processing time by your bank. Funds are deposited into your business checking account as soon as the next business day after approval and acceptance of terms.
 
(2) Early payoff discounts:
National Funding offers special opportunities for its customers to terminate contracts early and receive a discount in the process.  Equipment Finance customers who pay off the total remaining balance early,  at any point during the contract, will automatically receive a 6% discount off the total remaining balance.   Working Capital customers who pay off the total remaining balance in full within the first 100 days of the contract will automatically receive a 7% discount off the total remaining balance.  We do not currently offer a discount on our lease contracts. Customers must pay off the balance in full, be current, and in good standing to take advantage of the discount within the time parameters.
 
(3) Automatic payments:
Loan payments are withdrawn via Automatic Clearing House (ACH) Monday through Friday excluding bank holidays.
 
(4) Wide variety of payment options:

Equipment Financing: payments are remitted monthly with terms of 2-5 years
Working Capital Loan: payments can be remitted daily or weekly with terms of 4 months up to 24 months

 
(5) Huge potential tax savings:
Section 179 tax deduction is a lucrative and important tax break that has been made permanent across the board, under the Protecting America from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act).  In most cases, the IRS allows your equipment lease or loan payments to be 100% tax deductible!  You can secure the equipment, tools, and technology that you need, while also taking advantage of significant tax deductions — up to $500,000.  Consult your tax professional for more details.
 
(6) Guaranteed lowest payment:
Pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in these Rules and Restrictions of the Guaranteed Lowest Payment, National Funding guarantees to provide the lowest payment on equipment leased through National Funding, for lease terms from 24 to 60 months, or to pay $1000 towards qualifying executed leases. Lease payment comparisons must be based on a lease in excess of $10,000, for approved equipment, and with the same terms and conditions as those offered by National Funding within seven days that the National Funding terms are issued. To be eligible, customers must provide a competitive lease quote without contingencies, and vendor invoice, and in the name of the lessee within seven calendar days of the date National Funding issues its terms. Guarantee only valid on competitive equipment leases. Equipment finance agreements do not qualify.
In the event that the monthly lease payment amount from the competing lease company or bank is lower than the monthly payment that is being offered by National Funding for the same equipment and pursuant to the same terms, National Funding will verify the validity and accuracy of the competing leasing company’s or bank’s payment options, terms and the vendor quote. National Funding has the option, in its sole discretion, to either beat the competing leasing company’s or bank’s monthly payment rate, or pay $1000 to the lessee. The lessee must provide National Funding with the competing company’s or bank’s signed lease agreement with payment terms/options, and take delivery of the equipment. Payments will be made within 30 days, and lessee is responsible for any taxes.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is available to both new and established customers of National Funding. This offer is valid for new lease applications only. The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is not retroactive — a previously funded equipment lease with National Funding is not eligible for the Guaranteed Lowest Payment. Only non-contingent offers of lease terms and payment are eligible. Offers made to lessee that include subsidization by manufacturers and/or vendors will not be considered in comparing competing offers.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment may be discontinued at any time without notice.
To participate in the Guaranteed Lowest Payment program, if you have a lease agreement and vendor quote which you believe will qualify for the program, contact your National Funding Lease Manager.

Heavy Equipment Financing & Leasing 
Get the heavy-duty devices you need to get the job done — without hassle or delay


 







Home > Industry Specific Leasing & Financing > Heavy Equipment Financing & Leasing




Heavy Equipment Financing and Leasing
The benefits of heavy equipment financing and leasing from National Funding go far beyond just providing you with the tools you need at a more affordable price. Leases can better help you manage your overall financial situation, freeing up working capital for other needs while ensuring your balance sheet is in order.
Unlike taking out a loan to purchase a piece of heavy equipment, leasing does not require compensating balances, large down payments, client list reviews, cash flow projections and other strict qualifying standards many lenders require.  And National Funding’s small business loans don't require a down payment or collateral, and offer flexible terms.
Finally, under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, heavy equipment financing gives you the chance to secure valuable tax deductions to improve your business finances even further.
 
Financing and Leasing for Nearly Any Size of Equipment
Equipment leasing is used across numerous industries, and that includes sectors where machinery and tools come in big packages. While many small business owners are aware of their equipment financing options where it concerns everyday office equipment, leasing can also be used for large, heavy duty devices. Whether you work in construction, farming or another industry that depends on heavy equipment, now is the time to focus on your financing opportunities.



Big Tools for Big Jobs
Heavy equipment comes in all shapes and sizes, but it’s usually associated with large industrial machinery. 

 


Some types of heavy equipment to lease:

Bulldozers
Cement mixers
Conveyors
Cranes
Excavators
Forklifts
Graders
Threshers
Tractors
Wheel loaders


 




Along with big size, heavy equipment also often comes with a large price tag. It’s for this reason that business owners must think long and hard about all their options when it comes to acquisition. Price is also the primary reason many professionals turn to heavy equipment leasing instead of buying.
Through heavy equipment financing from National Funding, you can obtain the machinery you need for as long as you need it for a fraction of the price of buying outright. This allows you to get the job done without depleting crucial cash reserves.
 
Different Leases for Separate Requirements
No two businesses are exactly the same, so you deserve equipment leasing options that will be tailored to your specific needs.
Whether you’re a contractor, farmer, trucking and delivery professional or something else entirely, you can count on National Funding to provide you with a lease that is suited to your specific operations. With up to $150,000 in equipment financing, a simple, one-page applications and quick approvals, there’s nothing stopping you from acquiring the heavy equipment your business needs right now. 
Apply online today to explore your heavy equipment leasing options.

National Funding is a leader in the equipment financing industry. With our Lowest Payment Guarantee and no down payment requirement, we cost you less.

Disclosures
Legal Disclosures
True to our mission, we encourage you to read the following policies and learn how they affect you as a client.
 
(1) 24 hours:
Fast approvals and 24 hour funding subject to receipt of required documentation, underwriting guidelines, and processing time by your bank. Funds are deposited into your business checking account as soon as the next business day after approval and acceptance of terms.
 
(2) Early payoff discounts:
National Funding offers special opportunities for its customers to terminate contracts early and receive a discount in the process.  Equipment Finance customers who pay off the total remaining balance early,  at any point during the contract, will automatically receive a 6% discount off the total remaining balance.   Working Capital customers who pay off the total remaining balance in full within the first 100 days of the contract will automatically receive a 7% discount off the total remaining balance.  We do not currently offer a discount on our lease contracts. Customers must pay off the balance in full, be current, and in good standing to take advantage of the discount within the time parameters.
 
(3) Automatic payments:
Loan payments are withdrawn via Automatic Clearing House (ACH) Monday through Friday excluding bank holidays.
 
(4) Wide variety of payment options:

Equipment Financing: payments are remitted monthly with terms of 2-5 years
Working Capital Loan: payments can be remitted daily or weekly with terms of 4 months up to 24 months

 
(5) Huge potential tax savings:
Section 179 tax deduction is a lucrative and important tax break that has been made permanent across the board, under the Protecting America from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act).  In most cases, the IRS allows your equipment lease or loan payments to be 100% tax deductible!  You can secure the equipment, tools, and technology that you need, while also taking advantage of significant tax deductions — up to $500,000.  Consult your tax professional for more details.
 
(6) Guaranteed lowest payment:
Pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in these Rules and Restrictions of the Guaranteed Lowest Payment, National Funding guarantees to provide the lowest payment on equipment leased through National Funding, for lease terms from 24 to 60 months, or to pay $1000 towards qualifying executed leases. Lease payment comparisons must be based on a lease in excess of $10,000, for approved equipment, and with the same terms and conditions as those offered by National Funding within seven days that the National Funding terms are issued. To be eligible, customers must provide a competitive lease quote without contingencies, and vendor invoice, and in the name of the lessee within seven calendar days of the date National Funding issues its terms. Guarantee only valid on competitive equipment leases. Equipment finance agreements do not qualify.
In the event that the monthly lease payment amount from the competing lease company or bank is lower than the monthly payment that is being offered by National Funding for the same equipment and pursuant to the same terms, National Funding will verify the validity and accuracy of the competing leasing company’s or bank’s payment options, terms and the vendor quote. National Funding has the option, in its sole discretion, to either beat the competing leasing company’s or bank’s monthly payment rate, or pay $1000 to the lessee. The lessee must provide National Funding with the competing company’s or bank’s signed lease agreement with payment terms/options, and take delivery of the equipment. Payments will be made within 30 days, and lessee is responsible for any taxes.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is available to both new and established customers of National Funding. This offer is valid for new lease applications only. The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is not retroactive — a previously funded equipment lease with National Funding is not eligible for the Guaranteed Lowest Payment. Only non-contingent offers of lease terms and payment are eligible. Offers made to lessee that include subsidization by manufacturers and/or vendors will not be considered in comparing competing offers.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment may be discontinued at any time without notice.
To participate in the Guaranteed Lowest Payment program, if you have a lease agreement and vendor quote which you believe will qualify for the program, contact your National Funding Lease Manager.

       Frequently Asked Questions about the MELF Offering
    

 


       Q1. What is Macquarie Equipment Leasing Fund, LLC and what does it do?
    

       We are an investment vehicle that will make investments in equipment and equipment leases. We may also make investments in other equipment related transactions which will allow us to directly or indirectly participate in the benefits and risks of equipment ownership or usage. Those transactions may include equipment trading transactions, residual value guarantees, forward purchase agreements, investments in companies which lease equipment, total lease return swaps, participation agreements, equipment purchase options and other transactions involving equipment. We will not enter into stock, bond or other exchange traded derivative contracts.
    

       We are commonly referred to as an “equipment leasing fund” or “equipment leasing program.” Equipment leasing funds are often considered to be an alternative asset class, being non-correlated to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. Investments into alternative assets may provide diversification benefits for investors.
    

       When you purchase shares of membership or limited liability company interest in Macquarie Equipment Leasing Fund, LLC, the capital you invest is pooled with the capital contributions of other investors. Those capital contributions are combined with borrowings and, after payment of fees and expenses, invested in equipment, equipment leases and other equipment related transactions. The transactions in which we invest will be originated and managed by Macquarie Asset Management Inc., our manager.
    

       We anticipate that the majority of our revenue will be derived from:
    


        income received under lease agreements and other equipment related investments; and
      

        the proceeds received from the sale of equipment that had been subject to a lease or other equipment related investment.
      


Back to top


 


       Q2. What are our investment objectives?
    

       Our principal investment objectives are to:
    


        preserve, protect and return your invested capital;
      

        generate regular monthly cash distributions;
      

        reduce our overall risk through diversification of our portfolio;
      

        generate investment returns that are not correlated to returns from investments in listed stock and bond markets; and
      

        generate a favorable total return on your investment.
      


       There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to meet our investment objectives.

       Q3. What types of equipment and other transactions will be in our portfolio?
    

       Although the composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in rail equipment, such as freight cars or locomotives, maritime equipment, aviation equipment, such as commercial jet engines, road transportation equipment, manufacturing equipment, mining and construction equipment, technological and communications equipment, utilities equipment and/or other types of equipment that our manager determines may meet our investment objectives. We expect to invest in equipment located both within and outside the United States.
    

       The majority of our equipment investments will be accompanied by a corresponding lease with a corporate client. Typically, a client will select an item of equipment it requires for its business operations. We will then purchase that equipment and simultaneously lease it to that client for a fixed period. At the end of the lease period, the equipment is either returned to us, purchased by our client or is leased for a further period. To a lesser extent, we may purchase equipment for resale without a corresponding lease, or enter into other types of equipment related investments which will allow us to directly or indirectly participate in the benefits and risks of equipment ownership or usage. Those transactions may include equipment trading transactions, residual value guarantees, forward purchase agreements, investments in companies which lease equipment, total lease return swaps, participation agreements, equipment purchase options and other transactions involving equipment. We will not enter into stock, bond or other exchange traded derivative contracts.
    

       When contemplating investments in equipment, our manager may consider a range of factors including the remaining economic useful life of the equipment, the anticipated residual value of the equipment, whether the equipment is new or used and the condition of the equipment, equipment registration and regulatory considerations, portfolio diversification, client considerations such as available financial information about the client and how essential the equipment is to the operations of the client, the cash flow profile of the equipment and the depth of the equipment market and exit mechanisms.

       Q4. Who is our manager, Macquarie Asset Management Inc.?
    

       Our manager, Macquarie Asset Management Inc., is a member of the Macquarie Group Limited group of companies, which we refer to as the “Macquarie Group.” The Macquarie Group is a diversified international provider of banking, financial, leasing, advisory and investment services. As of January 31, 2009, the Macquarie Group operated in more than 60 offices in 27 countries and had approximately 12,800 employees, over 1,900 of whom were located across 25 offices in North and South America. As of December 31, 2008, the Macquarie Group had assets under management of approximately $171 billion. The Macquarie Group manages assets which provide valuable services in markets around the world.
    

       Our manager is operated by the Macquarie Group’s equipment leasing division. As of December 31, 2008, the Macquarie Group’s leasing division had approximately $5.3 billion of equipment leases under management with 580 employees located in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia / New Zealand across six different leasing business lines. These employees variously specialize in all aspects of equipment leasing operations, from transaction origination to asset management and equipment remarketing.

       Q5. What happens after you invest and when can you expect to receive distributions?
    

       Once our manager has accepted your subscription, you will receive a confirmation letter indicating our acceptance of your investment. We will hold our initial closing and our shares will be sold once a minimum of $2,500,000 in cash has been received within one year from the start of the offering, which may include the investment which will be made by our manager or its affiliates. Generally, we intend to begin making monthly cash distributions in the month following the first full month of operations after we have received a total of $2,500,000 in cash subscriptions. We may, however, elect not to make distributions until subscription funds have been invested, which could take as long as two years. If we elect to make distributions before funds have been fully invested, those distributions may be a return of capital.
    

       We anticipate that our operations will continue for approximately eight years. Our operations are divided into three phases:
    


        Our "offering period" is anticipated to last up to two years from the date of this prospectus. We will raise money from investors during the offering period. The more quickly we raise money, the greater the likelihood that we will raise the maximum amount in this offering and the greater the likelihood that the offering period will be shorter. After we have raised $2,500,000, which may include the investment which will be made by our manager or its affiliates. We will begin investing the offering proceeds into equipment, equipment leases and other equipment related transactions. Until offering proceeds are used for the acquisition or operation of our portfolio, the offering proceeds will be held in short-term, highly liquid investments which afford appropriate safety of principal.
      

        Our "operating period" is anticipated to last five years from the end of the offering period, but may last longer. During this period we will invest and re-invest in equipment, equipment leases and other equipment related transactions.
      

        Our "liquidation period" is anticipated to last one year from the end of the operating period, but not more than 36 months from the end of the operating period. During this period we will dispose of the remainder of our portfolio and make final distributions to our investors.
      


       Cash distributions are expected to continue each month for the duration of the offering and operating periods. However, the amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed.
    

Back to top


 


       Q6. Are there tax consequences and potential benefits of investing in us?
    

       We do not anticipate that we will pay federal income taxes. Instead, you will be taxed on your share of our net income.
    

       All of our income or losses and other tax items will be passed through to you and our other members. Our manager anticipates that during our early years, income taxes with respect to your distributive share of income may be tax-deferred by operating losses and depreciation deductions available from equipment leased to clients under operating leases. The total depreciation deductions available will be reduced to the extent that our equipment is located outside the U.S. and to the extent that we hold indirect interests in equipment. The passive activity rules under the Code will apply to individuals and most likely to our other members. Thus, you should anticipate that your share of our net income or net loss in each of our taxable years generally will be characterized as passive activity income or loss. Under the passive activity rules, you may deduct your passive activity losses only against passive activity income, and not against active income or interest, dividends and other forms of portfolio income.
    

       Employee benefit plans, such as qualified pension and profit sharing plans, Keogh plans and IRAs, are generally exempt from federal income tax, except that any net unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, that exceeds a specific deduction of $1,000 in any taxable year is subject to tax. Other charitable and tax-exempt organizations are also subject to tax on UBTI. Most of our net income, if any, in a given year will constitute UBTI, either because the income is rental income from personal property or because we intend to use leverage to help build our portfolio.
    

       You are urged to seek advice based on your individual circumstances from an independent tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences to you of an investment in us.
    

Back to top


 


       Q7. Will you be able to sell your investment in our shares?
    

       An investment in our shares is an illiquid investment and your ability to sell our shares will be extremely limited. You should only invest money that you can afford to have unavailable for at least eight years, net of distributions that are expected to be made to you during those years. Our shares will not be listed on any national securities exchange at any time and we will take steps to ensure that no public trading market develops for our shares. Our operating agreement allows you to request that we repurchase your investment in our shares from time to time, at a redemption price determined according to a pre-set formula. You should assume that the proceeds from a repurchase or sale, consisting of repurchase proceeds and distributions you received prior to repurchase, may be less than your original investment.
    

Back to top


 


       Q8. Where can you find more information?
    

       We have filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC regarding the shares we are offering by this prospectus and we will file periodic reports and other information with the SEC. These documents are available from the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Once you invest in us, you may contact our manager’s Investor Relations department regarding your account information. The telephone number is 866-965-7622. The address is Macquarie Asset Management Inc., Investor Relations, 225 Franklin St, 17th Floor, Suite 1700, Boston MA 02110.
    

       You are urged to thoroughly discuss an investment in us with your financial, tax and legal advisors.
    

       Frequently Asked Questions about the MELF Distribution Reinvestment Plan
    

       We have a distribution reinvestment plan, or DRP, that will allow you to have part or all of your distributions received from us during our offering period invested in additional shares. A copy of our DRP is included as Appendix C to our prospectus. You should read our DRP in its entirety before making any decision to participate.
    

Back to top


 


       Q9. What is the benefit of participating in the DRP?
    

       The benefit of participating in the DRP is that the issue of shares under the DRP will not be subject to selling commissions or the dealer manager fee. This will allow you to purchase shares under the DRP at a price of $9.00 instead of $10.00. The monthly distributions that we expect to pay per share issued under our DRP will be the same as the distributions paid on our other shares. This effectively means that our rate of distribution on shares issued under our DRP, expressed as a percentage of the purchase price of the shares, will be higher than for our other shares. As with all other shares in this offering, an organization and offering expense allowance is payable to our manager from the proceeds from shares issued under the DRP. The O&O expense allowance is $0.1925 per share sold under the DRP.
    

Back to top


 


       Q10. Who may participate in the DRP?
    

       Once you have made a minimum investment of $5,000 in our offering, you are eligible to participate in our DRP. Our DRP becomes effective once we receive our minimum offering amount of $2,500,000 in cash, which may include the investment which will be made by our manager or its affiliates. You may elect to have all or a portion of the cash distributions you receive during our offering period invested in additional shares pursuant to our DRP. We reserve the right to prohibit qualified plan investors from reinvesting their distributions if that participation would cause our underlying assets to constitute "plan assets".
    

Back to top


 


       Q11. When will additional shares be purchased?
    

       We will invest distributions in additional shares as soon as administratively possible after the distribution date, but in any event not later than 30 days from the distribution date, to the extent that our shares are available for purchase. Investment of distributions in our shares will begin with the next distribution payable after we receive your enrollment form.
    

Back to top


 


       Q12. What is the purchase price of the shares purchased under our DRP?
    

       Our dealer manager and selling dealers will not receive selling commissions or dealer manager fees with respect to shares purchased through our DRP, so the purchase price will be $9.00. Our manager will be entitled to an organization and offering expense allowance of $0.1925 per share sold pursuant to the DRP, which represents 2.14% of the offering price of shares under our DRP. Our DRP allows the purchase of fractional shares. You are likely to receive fractional shares.
    

Back to top


 


       Q13. How long will our DRP last?
    

       Our manager may terminate our DRP at any time in its sole discretion, although our DRP requires that participants receive ten business days notice of any termination that would have an adverse effect on the rights or obligations of a participant. Our DRP will terminate upon the earlier of the end of our offering period and the issuance of 800,000 shares under our DRP.
    

Back to top


 


       Q14. How can you participate in our DRP?
    

       You may choose to invest all or a portion of your distributions during the offering period at any time by completing the enrollment form included in Appendix C to our prospectus or by completing any other form provided to you by our manager, Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. or your broker. Your participation in our DRP will begin with the next distribution payable after receipt of your enrollment form.
    

Back to top


 


       Q15. How can you withdraw from our DRP?
    

       You may withdraw from our DRP at any time by providing written notice to Macquarie Asset Management Inc., Investor Relations, 225 Franklin St, Suite 1700, 17th Floor, Boston MA, 02110. Your withdrawal from our DRP will not affect shares committed for purchase prior to the date of the withdrawal notice.

       Q16. Who will administer our DRP?
    

       Our DRP will be administered by our manager, who can be contacted at:
    

       Macquarie Asset Management Inc.
       Investor Relations
       225 Franklin St, 17th Floor, Suite 1700

       Q17. Will you be able to sell your investment in our DRP shares?
    

       Shares purchased through our DRP will be subject to the same transfer restrictions as all other shares sold in this offering. See Question 7 "Will you be able to sell your investment in our shares?" above.
    

Back to top


 


       Q18. Where can you find more information?
    

       We have filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC regarding the DRP shares we are offering by this prospectus and we will file periodic reports and other information with the SEC.

Disclosures
Legal Disclosures
True to our mission, we encourage you to read the following policies and learn how they affect you as a client.
 
(1) 24 hours:
Fast approvals and 24 hour funding subject to receipt of required documentation, underwriting guidelines, and processing time by your bank. Funds are deposited into your business checking account as soon as the next business day after approval and acceptance of terms.
 
(2) Early payoff discounts:
National Funding offers special opportunities for its customers to terminate contracts early and receive a discount in the process.  Equipment Finance customers who pay off the total remaining balance early,  at any point during the contract, will automatically receive a 6% discount off the total remaining balance.   Working Capital customers who pay off the total remaining balance in full within the first 100 days of the contract will automatically receive a 7% discount off the total remaining balance.  We do not currently offer a discount on our lease contracts. Customers must pay off the balance in full, be current, and in good standing to take advantage of the discount within the time parameters.
 
(3) Automatic payments:
Loan payments are withdrawn via Automatic Clearing House (ACH) Monday through Friday excluding bank holidays.
 
(4) Wide variety of payment options:

Equipment Financing: payments are remitted monthly with terms of 2-5 years
Working Capital Loan: payments can be remitted daily or weekly with terms of 4 months up to 24 months

 
(5) Huge potential tax savings:
Section 179 tax deduction is a lucrative and important tax break that has been made permanent across the board, under the Protecting America from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act).  In most cases, the IRS allows your equipment lease or loan payments to be 100% tax deductible!  You can secure the equipment, tools, and technology that you need, while also taking advantage of significant tax deductions — up to $500,000.  Consult your tax professional for more details.
 
(6) Guaranteed lowest payment:
Pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in these Rules and Restrictions of the Guaranteed Lowest Payment, National Funding guarantees to provide the lowest payment on equipment leased through National Funding, for lease terms from 24 to 60 months, or to pay $1000 towards qualifying executed leases. Lease payment comparisons must be based on a lease in excess of $10,000, for approved equipment, and with the same terms and conditions as those offered by National Funding within seven days that the National Funding terms are issued. To be eligible, customers must provide a competitive lease quote without contingencies, and vendor invoice, and in the name of the lessee within seven calendar days of the date National Funding issues its terms. Guarantee only valid on competitive equipment leases. Equipment finance agreements do not qualify.
In the event that the monthly lease payment amount from the competing lease company or bank is lower than the monthly payment that is being offered by National Funding for the same equipment and pursuant to the same terms, National Funding will verify the validity and accuracy of the competing leasing company’s or bank’s payment options, terms and the vendor quote. National Funding has the option, in its sole discretion, to either beat the competing leasing company’s or bank’s monthly payment rate, or pay $1000 to the lessee. The lessee must provide National Funding with the competing company’s or bank’s signed lease agreement with payment terms/options, and take delivery of the equipment. Payments will be made within 30 days, and lessee is responsible for any taxes.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is available to both new and established customers of National Funding. This offer is valid for new lease applications only. The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is not retroactive — a previously funded equipment lease with National Funding is not eligible for the Guaranteed Lowest Payment. Only non-contingent offers of lease terms and payment are eligible. Offers made to lessee that include subsidization by manufacturers and/or vendors will not be considered in comparing competing offers.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment may be discontinued at any time without notice.
To participate in the Guaranteed Lowest Payment program, if you have a lease agreement and vendor quote which you believe will qualify for the program, contact your National Funding Lease Manager.

Payments will be made within 30 days, and lessee is responsible for any taxes.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is available to both new and established customers of National Funding. This offer is valid for new lease applications only. The Guaranteed Lowest Payment is not retroactive — a previously funded equipment lease with National Funding is not eligible for the Guaranteed Lowest Payment. Only non-contingent offers of lease terms and payment are eligible. Offers made to lessee that include subsidization by manufacturers and/or vendors will not be considered in comparing competing offers.
The Guaranteed Lowest Payment may be discontinued at any time without notice.
To participate in the Guaranteed Lowest Payment program, if you have a lease agreement and vendor quote which you believe will qualify for the program, contact your National Funding Lease Manager.

Leasing for New and Used Office Equipment
Do you have the right equipment to get your business buttoned-down?  Companies, from the smallest mom-and-pop down the street to the world’s largest multi-national firms, all have something in common… the need for dependable, modern and cost-effective office equipment. Having something as basic as the right tools can make the difference between success and bankruptcy. National Funding specializes in office equipment leasing and financing for our nation’s small businesses. Helping you to get the tools and equipment to be able to service your customers is what we do.
Office equipment doesn’t come cheap and constant technological advances may make it difficult to keep up with your competitors. But you can get all the latest tools and equipment you need to stay on the cutting edge, quickly and easily, while retaining your working capital and protecting your cash flow.
National Funding offers leases for both new and used equipment, a real advantage when cost is a consideration.  And because we can custom tailor your lease to your company’s budget, you can invest in needed equipment to achieve your growth potential.  At the same time, by leasing equipment, you’ll earn significant tax benefits while leaving other credit lines open for other needed expenditures.
You’re the business owner, and no one knows your business like you do.  And no one knows leasing like National Funding does.  Let us help you find the right lease for the office equipment that your company needs – replacement, upgrades, expansion.

Read our buying advice for equipment leasing


Buying Guide for Equipment Leasing
An Introduction to Equipment Leasing
The popularity of equipment leasing is proof that it makes good business sense. Around 80 percent of U.S. companies lease some or all of their equipment.
A leasing arrangement may be more affordable than you think. If you have good credit and can show ability to pay, a third party lender will purchase whatever you need up front and allow you to make regular payments over time.
This guide will show you the advantages to equipment leasing. It will teach you to compare lenders, get quotes and negotiate the best deal. Before you call an equipment lease supplier, let us help you do your homework. An informed decision is always the best decision.
The Benefits of Equipment Leasing
There are several benefits to leasing that you may not have thought of:

More spending power
Unlike bank loans, the up-front costs of equipment leasing are minimal; just two payments in advance are typically required. With more spending money in your pocket, you can focus on other priorities, such as marketing, increasing manpower or expanding your operation.
Up-to-date equipment
Technology moves at lightning speed, and your rival down the street may offer impressive services that you cannot provide. With some leases, it is possible to arrange equipment upgrades. That is why, you are always in step with ahead of and the competition in productivity and results.
Tax breaks
In some agreements, lease payments are fully deductible business expenses. That makes more sense than treating your depreciating equipment as a capital expenditure. Your tax advisor can help you better understand the impact of leasing.
Endless leasing possibilities
The kind of equipment for lease is not limited to ordinary business needs, such as phone systems and office furniture. Industry, agriculture, technology and food services are just a few of the fields with available products.

Before you decide to lease, think about what you are willing and able to spend. Rarely can you lease for an amount less than $5,000. Lenders also shy away from intangible assets, such as software, maintenance and warranties: It is possible to repossess a computer in the event of default, but costs for soft assets cannot be recouped.
However, given the many benefits of leasing, it is worth pursuing.
Comparing Lenders
For financing, you will choose from one of the following:

A leasing broker
Leasing brokers act as intermediaries. When you place your request, your broker will shop banks and financial institutions on your behalf. Since they know who is most likely to give you financing, brokers can save you a lot of legwork.
A captive leasing company
Most equipment manufacturers have a subsidiary company that handles their lease agreements. You probably would not deal with a company like this unless you know exactly what equipment you need and lease it directly from a dealer.

An independent lessor
Independent lessors lease directly to businesses. They may include banks or financial institutions that diversify, but many specialize in equipment leasing.

Entering into an equipment lease should feel like forming a partnership. Since your agreement may be long term, you should completely trust your lessor, just as you do your insurance agent or the dealer from whom you purchase all your cars.
You should not be rushed into a decision. The lessor should be knowledgeable about the specific industry you are in. He should have answers to all your questions, lots of experience and a proven track record.
Get references, preferably from businesses similar to your own, and follow up. Ask each contact if he was treated fairly and got a lease that met his needs. Ask how much help he had with the application and paperwork. Ask if he would use this lessor again.
In short, research your lessor just as thoroughly as he is researching you.
Getting Quotes
When you approach prospective lenders for quotes, they will need to know the cost of the equipment and desired length of the lease. Tell them whether or not you intend to eventually purchase the pieces. With four to six quotes, you will have a good idea of the going rate for your equipment.
Be sure you understand how the quote was calculated. For example, find out it if figured in a security deposit and how many advance payments were included. Do not expect quotes to be exactly on the penny; your payments may be slightly higher or lower depending on your credit history.
Finally, be clear about the circumstances under which your rate can change. If the lease allows your lender to hike your rate or charge an exorbitant fee for one late payment, find another lender.
Many leasing companies require at least two years of operation and a credit score of 600 at the very minimum. Ask what the requirements are before you apply. A business loan may be more suitable.
You should not fill out an application until you have firmly decided. Equipment leasing applications work a lot like credit applications, and excessive inquiries can affect your credit report.
Getting a Better Deal
With the right lessor and a little business savvy, you may be able to get a lower rate:

Negotiate the purchase price
It never hurts to ask, especially if you have a good relationship with your lender or have been in business a long time.
 Negotiate the interest rate
Rates for leases under $100,000 range from 10-19% depending on credit history, length of the lease and where you live. Larger leases offer more competitive rates around 6-8%. A brokers fee increases your rate by 3-5 %.
 Drop the soft assets
If your lease covers some of the soft assents mentioned earlier, like warranties or installation costs, recalculate it without those. The convenience of paying one bill each month is simply not worth the extra money you pay to carry those items. If you have no choice but to include them, make sure your leasing company is used to dealing with them.
Leasing business equipment is smart. By doing your homework beforehand, the process will go more smoothly and you will get a better deal.

Qualifying for Equipment Leasing.
When someone leases equipment they are essentially securing the use of that particular type of equipment though what is more or less a rental agreement. A lease is an agreement of payments set over a fixed period of time for the use of what ever is being provided whether it be a vehicle, heavy machinery even computers. At the end of the term the equipment is returned. Many prefer leasing equipment because it provides all the benefits of usage with out the responsibility of ownership. It is also very helpful for businesses with limited resources, allowing them to pay a little at a time for new equipment rather than everything at once, which is usually out of reach.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
