Inventory Optimization
Park City Group’s Store Level Replenishment (SLR) application is a store ordering solution that optimizes store level demand forecasting for regular turn merchandise and promotional products. With our inventory optimization software, you’ll be able to generate more accurate replenishment orders and ensure your inventory levels are right on target.
With Park City Group’s Store Level Replenishment, you’ll be able to:

Identify current and predicted out of stocks at the shelf level
Reduce out of stocks especially during promotions
Increase sales because you have the right product on the shelves
Improve promotion execution and effectiveness
Tap into our network of industry-leading retailers

Stock outs account for more than 4% in lost sales every year. Our optimal inventory software will help you reduce stock-outs and create accurate forecasts at the store level. Park City Group’s inventory solutions can help you increase your visibility across the entire supply chain and ensure that your products get to the shelf first. 
We also offer analyst services to further optimize your store replenishment system and/or assist with the launch. Park City Group is a leader in inventory management and offers a variety of complementary services and software packages to help you stay at the top of your game. Whatever your inventory needs, we have the solution for you.
To learn more about our store inventory software and how your business can achieve optimal inventory levels, please visit our Benefits of Store Level Replenishment page or contact us to get started!
