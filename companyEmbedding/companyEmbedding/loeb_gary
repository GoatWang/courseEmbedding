A Nestlé plant in Michigan produces bottled water. The company emphasized on Tuesday that it was prepared to spend to bolster the fast-growing parts of its business.

LONDON — In revealing his investment position in Nestlé on Sunday, the hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb urged the company to consider slimming down, as well as buying back its stock.On Tuesday, Nestlé said it was indeed prepared to spend billions of dollars on buybacks — but the company also suggested that it might pursue a number of acquisitions in addition to shedding businesses.Nestlé said it could buy back almost $21 billion of its shares over the next three years to create value for its shareholders. The company added that it would consider making acquisitions in fast-growing parts of its business portfolio, including coffee, pet care, bottled water and consumer health care.The plan suggests significant change at Nestlé, the Swiss food giant whose products include Kit Kat bars and Stouffer’s frozen pizzas, at a time when its once-enviable growth rates have declined as consumer tastes change.

Nestlé said that the plans it announced on Tuesday had arisen from a regular review of the company’s capital positions — its top managers began the review in January — and that the announcement was not a response to Mr. Loeb’s activist campaign.


            How Nestlé Makes Its Money        

            Nestlé’s products include candy, water, dairy and pet food, though its candy business has waned, especially as fewer Americans have displayed an appetite for sweets.

While the company traditionally presents such proposals in September, this time it chose to release the announcement the same day it received regulatory clearance to do so.Yet Nestlé’s new strategic course came out only two days after Mr. Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, emerged as one of the company’s biggest shareholders and presented suggestions aimed at shaking up what Third Point described as a significant underperformer.Among Mr. Loeb’s suggestions was to trim a portfolio of some 2,000 brands to remove dead weight.Tuesday’s announcement revealed that Nestlé had reached some of the same conclusions. The company said its board was prepared to spend up to 20 billion Swiss francs on stock buybacks. And the conglomerate said it planned to continue to “adjust” its portfolio of operations.

Nestlé announced this month that it was considering a sale of its American candy business, home of Gobstoppers and Butterfinger bars, with the unit in a prolonged sales slump.Nestlé, however, also emphasized that it was prepared to spend, and potentially spend a lot, to bolster the fast-growing parts of its business. The areas it named as candidates for deal making include those that the company’s chief executive, Ulf Mark Schneider, identified this year as important growth areas.Such deals would be a higher priority than the stock buybacks: Nestlé said the bulk of its share repurchases would take place in 2019 and 2020 to let the company make takeovers first.The company said it was open to improving its profit margins, another topic broached by Third Point.But one of Mr. Loeb’s suggestions — selling off Nestlé’s 23 percent stake in L’Oréal, a cosmetics company — may not find favor among Nestlé’s top managers. In February, Mr. Schneider described the L’Oréal stake as a “strategic asset” and suggested that any change to it be done carefully.A spokeswoman for Third Point declined to comment on Nestlé’s announcement.

 Correction: June 29, 2017  
An earlier version of a graphic that accompanied this article misstated the size of Nestlé’s sales figures. They are in billions of Swiss francs, not millions.
