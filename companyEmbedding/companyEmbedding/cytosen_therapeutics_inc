Our Mission
 
 
 


CytoSen Therapeutics is an innovative team of medical and scientific professionals on a mission to advance natural (NK) cell therapeutics and to make it a real cure in the fight with cancer. Our mission is to make an effective, expedient, and accessible NK cell therapy for patients and providers at a wide range of points-of-care. CytoSen’s nanoparticle-based technology for NK cell production combined with the potential for multiple indications with wide accessibility allows the potential to treat thousands of cancer patients.
 
Discover more about us.

 
 
 




Technology
 
 
 


CytoSen is bringing innovation to NK cell therapy by generating large numbers of highly-active NK cells with its nanoparticle-based “expansion and activation” process.  Born from the intersection of cellular immunotherapy and nanotechnology, CytoSen’s NK cell therapy harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer.
 
See how CytoSen’s NK cell therapy harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer.

 
 
 



Broad Cancer Fighting Potential
 
 
 


Unlike many immuno-oncology therapies being investigated today, CytoSen’s unique, patented methods produce cellular immunotherapeutics that are scalable, robust, and accessible. Without a requirement for genetic modification or manipulation, CytoSen’s NK cell therapy have the potential to treat a broad range of cancers.

[–][+]NK Cell Therapies for More Effective Immuno-Oncology Treatments
 
 
 


Unlike other cell therapies, natural killer (NK) cell therapy has the potential to be used as a treatment component for many types of cancers. It’s not limited to a specific type of tumor. CytoSen’s NK cell therapeutics can be standardized and offer a point-of-care, expedient solution for patients and providers. Combine the potential for multiple indications with wide accessibility and CytoSen’s method of treatment has the potential to treat hundreds of thousands of cancer patients.
 
 
 
 



[–][+]CytoSen’s NK Cell Therapies Are Scalable with Broad Applications
 
 
 


NK cells are a major component of the immune system that guard against cancer. However, there are important differences between NK cells and T cells. T cells need to be “taught” or “engineered” by genetic modification to recognize a cancerous cell and thus are limited in application to cancers that possess identifiable targets. NK cells have the natural ability to recognize and kill dangerous cells by detecting cell surface proteins that are indicative of being stressed or foreign, or detecting the absence of proteins that indicate normal self.
CytoSen’s co-founder and medical director, Dr. Dean Lee has developed methods that use “feeder cells” engineered to stimulate log-scale expansion (growth and multiplying) of NK cells while also increasing their potency against cancer cells. This methodology is now being used in several clinical trials that are showing safety, feasibility, and early promise. To make NK cell therapies more accessible, scalable, and robust, CytoSen has in-licensed technology from Dr. Alicja Copik’s lab at the University of Central Florida. Dr. Copik’s team has devised methods to replace the feeder cells with nanoparticles possessing the same NK cell stimulatory effects. The nanoparticle expansion technology is a logistically simple and a scalable solution to widely disseminate NK cell therapeutics, allowing for future growth of this field.
