About Us













The Noonan Family:
Home Comfort Pioneers in the Pioneer Valley for over a Century!
 Timothy F. Noonan, son of Irish immigrants, began the proud tradition of business ownership that can be traced over five generations. It's the American Dream - alive and well over 100 years later right here at home in the Pioneer Valley.
Then And Now: Over 125 Years Of Service
Take a trip down memory lane and discover how the Noonan family has been proudly serving the Pioneer Valley area, delivering all the comforts of home. 

































Our Timeline





1890

The beginnings of an American Dream: Timothy F. Noonan starts his own business, T.F. Noonan Ice Dealer, as a home delivery ice dealer in Springfield, Massachusetts.



1911

 Timothy F. Noonan changes the company name to Massasoit Lake Ice Company.



1923

The Second Generation: Timothy's son, Edward J. Noonan, takes the reins, purchasing the Massasoit Lake Ice Company from his father.



1928

The industrious Edward J. Noonan adds kerosene and home heating oil to the products his company delivers, calling the business Massasoit Lake Ice and Fuel Company.



1939

With the popularity of the refrigerator chipping away at the ice business, Ed Noonan diversifies by opening a gasoline station at the corner of King Street and Eastern Avenue.



1958

The third generation: Edward J. Noonan sells the business to two of his sons, Timothy and William, who run the company by the name of Noonan Oil Company, Inc. Though set back by the 1973 oil embargo, they are able to expand sales and develop new markets. Timothy later becomes the sole proprietor in 1981.



1973

Timothy's son, Ed Noonan, great-grandson of the first Timothy F. Noonan, launches his own career as the fourth generation Noonan to operate his own fuel home delivery business, purchasing Palmer Coal and Oil. During that same year, Noonan Oil Company, the family business started by Ed's great grandfather (and operated at that time by Ed's father), celebrates its 83rd anniversary.



1978

The emergence of what is today known as Noonan Energy begins with Ed's second acquisition – the Leonard Oil Company of Monson. This doubles the size of the company then known as Palmer Coal and Oil.



1982

Palmer Coal and Oil continues to grow with the purchase of Dulude Oil, Inc. Palmer Oil Company is also added to the Palmer Coal and Oil family that same year.



1985

Ed Noonan purchases Springfield's City Oil, and its subsidiaries, Marquis-Rivest of Holyoke and Tinco Fuel of Ludlow, join the Palmer Coal and Oil Family.The birth of Noonan Energy: One Name for Many Community Based Companies: Ed recognizes that even through these acquisitions and the increased size of Palmer Coal and Oil, customers remain connected to their oil company. He chooses to continue using familiar company names while blending the many community oil companies under a single umbrella of corporate identity. NOONAN ENERGY is born.



1987

Better Heat, Inc., Bolduc Fuel, and Royal Heating become Noonan Energy's newest members.



1988

Noonan Oil Company, owned by Ed's father, Timothy – previously owned by Ed's grandfather, Edward – and founded by Ed's great-grandfather, Timothy, in 1890 – joins Noonan Energy Companies. This same year, National Heating of Amherst is acquired, introducing Noonan Energy to the retail and commercial air conditioning business.



1989

Canary Oil of West Springfield and Hampshire Oil of Sunderland become members of Noonan Energy.



1990

Noonan celebrates its 100th anniversary!.



1998

Even though Ted Noonan (Ed's son) has been in the business all his life, he now joins the company full time to become the fifth generation Noonan to work in the family heating business.



1999

Noonan continues to flourish under the leadership of Ed Noonan. In 1999, Hillside Oil Co. and Davis Fuel Co. become part of the Noonan Energy family, as does Hadley Fuel Co. in 2000.



2004

Springdale Oil Co., in Holyoke Massachusetts joins our family.



2005

D. Petracone & Son, in Ware Massachusetts joins our growing family in November.



2006

February - Noonan Energy enters into a long term agreement to purchase Noel's Heating of Chicopee, MA. The Laflamme family has long had a reputation for providing a high level of customer satisfaction and made the choice easy for Noonan.



2009

January - Noonan acquires Matera Oil Company of Thorndike, MA. The relationship between Matera and Noonan goes back many years making this an ideal fit for Noonan and capitalizes on our mission to acquire similarly run family owned companies that provide exceptional service.



2009

June - Tim Noonan (Ed's older brother) returns and becomes the Director of Sales at Noonan Energy.



2009

December - Ted Noonan (fifth generation) assumes the role of President of Noonan Energy and Ed Noonan becomes the Chairman.



2011

July - Noonan is pleased to announce the addition of Master plumber Mark Gadoury as we introduce our new plumbing division in order to further diversify and expand additional offerings to our customers.



2011

October - Noonan purchases the assets of Whiteley Fuel Oil Co of Chatham, MA. This acquisition allows us to grow the business outside of our regular market area and we encourage any of our Western MA customers to take us with them to the Cape. Noonan recognized Whiteley to be a well run business and when the opportunity arose to acquire Whiteley we were very fortunate to have been selected. www.whiteleyfueloil.com



2012

January - Noonan acquires Ray Kelley & Son of Palmer, MA. The Noonan and Kelley families go back many years together and Noonan is proud to have the opportunity to continue the Kelley Oil tradition of providing their customers with exceptional service while expanding our offerings to all the Kelley customers.



2012

February - Home Energy Audit division is born under the leadership and direction of Carey Noonan. This division will allow us to offer home energy audits to customers so that they are able to take advantage of many costs savings measures that will also have long term benefits to the comfort of their homes.



2013

January - East Springfield Oil Company of East Springfield joined the Noonan Energy family.



2015


Noonan celebrates its 125th anniversary!
