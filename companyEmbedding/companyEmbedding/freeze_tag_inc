(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION  Forward-Looking Statements  This Annual Report on Form 10-K of Freeze Tag, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2016 contains forward-looking statements, principally in this Section and "Business." Generally, you can identify these statements because they use words like "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "future," "intends," "plans," and similar terms. These statements reflect only our current expectations. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties, many of which are unforeseen, including, among others, the risks we face as described in this filing. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements that, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In any forward-looking statement where we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation of belief will be accomplished.  We believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors. There may be events in the future; however, that we are unable to predict accurately or over which we have no control. The risk factors listed in this filing, as well as any cautionary language in this annual report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, include, but are not limited to: distributors not accepting our games; price reductions; unforeseen delays in game production; changes in product strategies; general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in various tax laws; and the availability of key management and other personnel.  Table of Contents  Summary Overview  Freeze Tag, Inc. is a leading creator of mobile social games that are fun and engaging for all ages. Based on a free-to-play business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide to worldwide success, we employ state-of-the-art data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation. Players can download and enjoy our games for free, or they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor. Our games encourage players to compete and engage with their friends on major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.  During our most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $138,720 from the sales of our games or in-app purchases in our games compared to $43,968 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Going forward, with our shift to free-to-play games, we anticipate the vast majority of our revenue in future years will be derived from consumers making in-game purchases in one of our free-to-play games and that revenue from consumers paying to download a game will be minimal.  Our business strategy is now focused on free-to-play games that require constant updates and new content to keep players engaged. Therefore, we no longer measure our success based upon the quantity of titles we launch, but rather on the metrics we receive as we monitor and try to improve upon our games in the market.  In Q3 of 2016, we began increasing the production of our mobile games by using some existing game frameworks and hiring outside developers and art resources to help with the initial development stages of building a mobile game. As a result, we launched 8 mobile games or content updates between August and December 2016:  � Word Quest - August 23, 2016  We have also announced our intention to grow the company through acquisition. We feel that the time is right to build an alliance of mobile game developers who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence, development expertise and cross-promotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated a net loss of $2,129,419, primarily attributable to increases in cost of sales and loss on change in derivative liabilities, as described below.  Going Concern Uncertainty  As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred net losses of $2,129,419 and $1,870,677 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $11,113,929. During the years ended December 3l, 2016 and 2015, we experienced negative cash flows from operations largely due to continued investment spending for product development of game titles for smartphones and tablets that are expected to benefit future periods. Those facts, along with our lack of access to a significant bank credit facility, create an uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, we are currently evaluating alternatives to secure financing sufficient to support the operating requirements of its current business plan, as well as continuing to execute its business strategy of distributing game titles to digital distribution outlets, including mobile gaming app stores, online PC and Mac gaming portals, and opportunities for new devices such as tablet (mobile internet device) applications, mobile gaming platforms and international licensing opportunities.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our success in securing sufficient financing and in successfully executing our plans to return to positive cash flows during fiscal 2016. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern.  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Estimates  Revenue Recognition  Our revenues are derived primarily by licensing software products in the form of online and downloadable games for PC, Mac and smartphone platforms. We distribute our products primarily through online games portals and smartphone device manufacturers ("distribution partners"), which market the games to end-users. The nature of our business is such that we sell games basically through four distribution outlets - web portals, brick and mortar retail distributors, mobile distributors and publishers, and our own web portal, www.freezetag.com. However, going forward, the majority of our revenue will be derived from mobile distribution partners such as Apple, Google and Amazon.  Product Sales (web and mobile revenues)  We recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers, and once any performance obligations have been completed. Revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.  Licensing Revenues (retail revenues- royalties)  Third-party licensees distribute games under license agreements with us. We receive royalties from the licensees as a result. We recognize these royalties as revenues upon receipt of the monthly or quarterly (varies per distribution partner) revenue reports provided by the partner. Revenue from licensing/royalties is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection.  Some license agreements require a royalty advance from the licensee/distributor in which case the original advance is recognized as a liability and royalty revenue is deducted from the advance as earned.  Other Revenues  Other revenues primarily include Ad game revenue and work-for-hire game related revenue. We derive our advertising game revenue from certain of our partners that offer our games free of charge to consumers in exchange for the consumers being exposed to advertising embedded in our games. In this way, we do not receive revenue for the sale of our games, but rather a percentage of the "advertising" revenue generated by these player views. This method of generating revenue is essentially the same as traditional radio or television advertising where consumers are allowed to enjoy content for "free" but are forced to watch (or listen) to advertising before, in between and at the end of the programming content.  Additionally, we derive some revenue from "work-for-hire" projects. Some of our partners occasionally ask us to render "work-for-hire" services for them such as preparing packaging materials. For example, a retail game and DVD publisher hired us to create several designs for printed packages that were used for games published by the publisher but not developed by us. For this work, we charge a one-time, fixed fee for each package design.  Table of Contents  We recognize this revenue once all performance obligations have been completed. In addition, persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable.  We recognize revenue in accordance with current accounting standards when an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is probable.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, we consider liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We place our cash and cash equivalents with large commercial banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insures these balances, up to $250,000. All of our cash balances at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were insured. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no cash equivalents.  Allowances for Returns, Price Protection, and Doubtful Accounts  Because the majority of our business is derived through online portals (such as Big Fish Games) and wireless online app stores (such as Apple), there is no physical product, other than the downloadable bits of our games that is involved in the customer purchase. In the digital environment, the customer cannot 'return' a digital download product. Therefore, there are no returns. The customer can ask for a refund of a digital product, and if there are any, then they are reconciled or netted out by our distribution partners before we receive the corresponding payments and royalty statements. As such, we do not allow for returns, bad debts or price protection of digital download products.  However, we derive a small portion of our revenues from sales of physical packaged software for personal computers through distribution partners who sell through traditional retail channels. Product revenue is recognized net of allowances for price protection and returns and various customer discounts. Our distribution partners who sell to retailers may allow returns for our packaged personal computer products; these partners may decide to provide price protection or allow returns for personal computer products after they analyze:  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. All assets are currently depreciated over 3 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and improvements of a major nature are capitalized. At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations.  Table of Contents  Concentrations of Credit Risk, Major Customers and Major Vendors  Our customers are the end-consumers that purchase its games from the websites where we have our games listed for sale. Therefore, we do not have any individual customers that represent any more than a fraction of its revenue. However, we do have primary distribution partners, which are the owners of the websites where it sells its games. Under our distribution agreements we are not obligated to make, distribute or sell any games. However, for any games we do make and wish to distribute we can list them on one or more of these websites under a revenue sharing arrangement where we shares the revenue from any of our games that sell. The sharing arrangement varies greatly depending on the distributor with the Company generally keeping between 35% and 70% of the revenue and the distributor keeping the remainder of the revenue generated by each sale. At times we enter into "exclusivity options" whereby if a distributor wishes to have an exclusive period carrying our games (normally 30-90 days) we will agree to that in exchange for the distributor marketing the game in their newsletter and other marketing programs. Due to the fact we have a number of distribution partners and a variety of different websites where we can sell our games, we are not substantially dependent on any of our distribution partners or agreements. In addition to the distribution agreements, we currently have a licensing agreement with Paws, Inc., which allow us to develop and distribute games around third party intellectual property in exchange for paying royalty payments. We are not substantially dependent on that licensing agreement.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company's primary distributors that represented 10% or more of its revenues were: Apple - 28.78%, Square Enix Ltd. 28.25% and G5 Holdings Limited - 18.02%. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's primary distributors that represented 10% or more of its revenues were: Big Fish Games - 23.67%, Wired Media - 22.74%, Apple - 18.08% and S.A.D. - 13.51%.  At December 31, 2016, the Company's primary distributors and partners that represented 10% or more of its accounts receivable were: Exent - 52.38% and Apple - 13.48%. At December 31, 2015, the Company's primary distributors and partners that represented 10% or more of its accounts receivable were: Apple - 16.93%, Big Fish Games - 10.00% and Exent - 48.81%.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes using ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  ASC Topic 740 includes accounting guidance which clarifies the accounting for the uncertainty in recognizing income taxes in an organization by providing detailed guidance for financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure involving uncertain tax positions. This guidance requires an uncertain tax position to meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized both upon the adoption of the related guidance and in subsequent periods.  We have no uncertain tax positions at any of the dates presented.  Foreign Currency Translation  We derive a portion of our revenue from foreign countries, which report to us in foreign currency, but pay in U.S. Dollars. Because of the fluctuations between the reporting time and the payment period (up to 60 days), it is necessary to make adjustments to our accounting records. These adjustments are recorded under a Foreign Currency Translation expense account, and shown in the Statement of Operations as a General & Administrative expense.  Table of Contents  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation and ASC Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees ("ASC stock-based compensation guidance"). Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the requisite services period is based on the value of share-based payment awards after reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  We did not have any stock-based compensation expense recognized in its statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360-10"). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by us be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of long-lived assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10") and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Neither of these statements had an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  Inputs used in the valuation to derive fair value are classified based on a fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity's own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:  � Level one - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  � Level two - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  � Level three - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.  Determining the category in which an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each period.  Table of Contents  The following tables provide a summary of the fair values of assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2016 and 2015:   Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Losses 2016 (Gains) Derivative liabilities $ 1,934,617 $ - $ - $ 1,934,617 $ 616,286 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Losses 2015 (Gains) Derivative liabilities $ 841,677 $ - $ - $ 841,677 $ 106,543  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and these differences may be material.  Research and Development Costs  We charge costs related to research and development of products to general and administrative expense as incurred. The types of costs included in research and development expenses include research materials, salaries, contractor fees, and support materials.  Intellectual Property Licenses (Prepaid Royalties)  Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks or copyrights in the development of the Company's products. Intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks, copyrights, software, technology, music or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products. Depending upon the agreement with the rights holder, we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years, or alternatively, for a single product. Minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property licenses are initially recorded as an asset (prepaid royalties or prepaid licensing fees), and a current liability, (accrued royalties payable) at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract when no significant performance remains with the licensor. Commencing upon the related product's release date, intellectual property licenses costs are amortized to "Cost of Sales - Licensing" based upon the percentage of revenue outlined in the contract with each specific licensor. Generally, our intellectual property licensing contracts call for licensors to be paid a percentage of revenue actually received by us, with allowances for minimum guarantees. Sometimes, the terms of the specific licensing contracts allow for us to re-capture expenses before licensing out royalties are calculated.  Capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, prepaid royalties (or prepaid licensing fees) were $4,430 and $4,507, respectively.  Table of Contents  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-4, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." This update simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An entity should apply the amendments in this update on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. That disclosure should be provided in the first annual period and in the interim period within the first annual period when the entity initially adopts the amendments in this update. A public business entity that is an SEC filer should adopt the amendments in this Update for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-1, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business." The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments of this ASU are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments." This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently unable to determine the impact on its financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.  Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015  Revenues  Our revenues increased $94,752 to $138,720 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $43,968 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of this increase, $67,832 resulted from a decrease in our unearned royalties, with other increases due mainly to increased in-game purchases from the players of our Kitty Pawp title. . . .

Mobile Games Expected to Generate $24 Billion by 2016
 
Free-to-play Business Model
The free-to-play business model for games was pioneered on the PC platform and has exploded globally on the mobile platform. The free-to-play model allows users to download and play an enjoyable, but limited portion of a game for free. If the user wants to access premium features or special virtual items to increase the fun factor, then the user is required to pay, usually $0.99 per feature or item.
In a just a few years, the free-to-play business model has proven to be a very successful model for mobile games. The revenue potential of a game largely depends on the addictiveness of the game and the game creator’s proprietary techniques for encouraging or forcing the player into make a purchase decision – without overly offending the player. The potential for rapidly spreading the game through social networks and small in-game purchases adds up to a very sizeable business opportunity. One of the top grossing games in 2013 was Candy Crush Saga, a seemingly simple game where a user combines 3 or more color candies on a puzzle board to get points. As of February 2014, Think Gaming estimates that Candy Crush Saga grossed over $771,000 per day, or over $280 million per year, with a life-time user revenue of merely $3.00 from in-game purchases.

Freeze Tag mobile games are based on the free-to-play model. In addition, we believe that games are more fun with friends, so we connect them with major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to enhance the games’ addictiveness, enjoyment and world-of-mouth referrals. In executing our business model, we employ a proprietary game engine and real-time data analytics to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation.
Explosive Growth for Mobile Games
According to a 2013 report from Newzoo, the mobile games market generated $12.3 billion, or 17.4% of all global game revenues. By 2016, mobile games are forecast to account for 27.8% of global game revenues, or $23.9 billion, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.3%.  This is almost four times higher than the game industry as a whole, or 6.7%, which includes traditional blockbuster titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and Super Mario.

According to Newzoo, there are 5 key reasons why the mobile game segment has and will continue to experience impressive growth.

Two Screens – As it turns out, consumers view smartphones and tablets as having their own right of existence.  They play games on both devices, which increase their play time and fuels the mobile games segment simultaneously on more than one screen.
Accessibility – Gaming on mobile screens is pushing time spent on games up dramatically as consumers can play at anytime and anywhere.
Global reach – As smartphones and tablets penetrate every corner of the world, developers can launch titles into any country they choose. Countries that were previously hard to penetrate are now appearing on the opportunity radar.
Free-to-play – It is the dominant business model for mobile taking over 90% of global revenues.
Hardware innovation – Driven by fierce competition, the pace of innovation on smartphones and tablets goes unmatched. This continuously provides developers with new opportunities.

A Truly Global Market
With the ability to play games anytime and anywhere on powerful smartphones and tablets running primarily Apple iOS or Google Android, the mobile game market is truly a scalable global business opportunity.
These 2013 market statistics from Newzoo describe a very exciting and growing global mobile game market:

Of the 1.2 billion gamers worldwide, 966 million, or 78%, already play mobile games.
368 million consumers worldwide, or 38% of all mobile gamers, spend a monthly average of $2.78 on or in mobile games. By 2016, these figures will amount to, respectively, 50% and $3.07.
With 48% of the global revenue, the Asia-Pacific region is by far the biggest market for mobile games.
Western & Eastern Europe will grow fastest with compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of over 33%.
Average monthly spend per paying mobile gamer is highest in Western Europe with $4.40. In comparison, in North America this figure stands at $3.87, with however the highest share of payers amongst players worldwide (45%).

The Female Player
The explosive growth of the mobile games market can be partly attributed to an unexpected factor: the female player. Gaming is historically a male dominated market with action based games. But the modern female with disposable income, a smartphone and time on her hands has changed everything. This market development has opened the door wide for a previously niche category of games referred to as “casual” games. Candy Crush Saga is an example of a casual game, and clearly, this is no longer a niche category.

The Freeze Tag Strategy
In targeting the global market for mobile games, Freeze Tag is highly focused on developing mobile social games that are casual, fun and engaging for all ages and gender. The free-to-play business model combined with our proprietary rapid game development engine allows us to systematically launch, optimize and monetize our games. We design our games to be never ending entertainment that our users will enjoy playing and be willing to pay us $0.99 from time-to-time for special features and virtual items to keep having fun. We believe that the free-to-play model should not be run as a sprint but rather as a marathon. Over the span of several months, or even years, each game is continuously subject to this optimization process to increase user enjoyment and financial return to the company.
Freeze Tag was founded by gaming industry veterans, and has launched several successful casual mobile games including the number one hit series Victorian Mysteries® and Unsolved Mystery Club®, as well as digital entertainment like Etch A Sketch®. Freeze Tag games have been downloaded millions of times from the Apple, Amazon and Google app stores.
