 RICEBRAN TECHNOLOGIES (NASDAQ:RIBT) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On July 14, 2017, RiceBran Technologies (“Company”), Healthy Natural, Inc. (“HN”), the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, and United Laboratories Manufacturing, LLC (“Buyer”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), to which HN agreed to sell to Buyer the assets used in HN’s contract manufacturing and packaging business (“Asset Sale”). The Asset Sale occurred simultaneously with the signing of the Purchaser Agreement.
The purchase price payable by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement consisted of approximately $18.3 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. The purchase price is subject to adjustment if the estimated closing working capital with respect to the assets sold and the liabilities assumed is different than the actual closing working capital for those assets and liabilities. $225,000 of the purchase price has been deposited in an escrow account to be used to satisfy any Company obligations that may arise relating to this working capital adjustment.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions. $550,000 of the purchase price has been deposited into an indemnity escrow account to satisfy indemnification claims against the Company, if any. In addition, the Purchase Agreement contains non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that restrict the Company, for a period of five years following the Asset Sale, from engaging in a business conducted by HN during the 12-month period before the closing of the Asset Sale, from diverting certain contract manufacturing businesses from Buyer and from hiring current or former employees of Buyer.
Allegiance Capital Corporation advised the Company in connection with the Asset Sale and was paid a fee of $519,350 upon the closing of the Asset Sale.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
   Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.   The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.

RiceBran Technologies has been in operation for seventeen years and has become a global leader in rice bran and rice bran derivative products for food manufacturers and animal nutrition companies.
This company offers high quality products including rice bran oil that can be used in a variety of food applications including nutrition bars, protein shakes, bread dough, and fortified cereals.
Please read below to learn more about the RiceBran Technologies Company and see a bit more information about their full product line.
What Is RiceBran Technologies?
Established in 2000, RiceBran Technologies has become a global leader in the acquisition and processing of rice bran, rice bran oil, and rice bran derivatives.
RiceBran Technologies manufactures products targeted at food manufacturers, meat inclusion companies, nutraceutical companies, and the field of animal nutrition.
Rice bran is a great alternative to wheat, corn, or oat bran because it is free of allergens, gluten, and trans fat.
RiceBran Technologies Processing Details
With facilities located in Brazil and two processing facilities based in the United States, the process includes the bran and germ being removed from the kernel before the rice bran goes through a series of treatments including heat, water, and pressure that stabilize the grain and deactivates the enzymes that cause rancidity.
Once this process is complete the stabilized rice bran is dried and packaged for shipment. At Stage 2 of the bran processing water and enzymes are added to the stabilized rice bran to produce slurry.
This slurry is then processed further to separate the insoluble fiber fraction, called RiFiber, and aqueous dispersible fraction, called RiSolubles.
These two products are then packaged for food manufacturers or humanitarian relief. Rice bran oil is produced from a further stage and companies can purchase this product by the tanker truck if desired.
RiceBran Technologies Products
This company offers a range of bran products that offer companies the ability to add nutrition to their food products.



Whether food manufacturing companies are looking for oil, powder, or protein additive for pet food, RiceBran Technologies has a high quality option to consider.
RiBran Products:

Food Ingredient: Offers a one year shelf life and gives companies a highly stable bean product that will add flavor and texture to a variety of food products. This product contains no gluten or other allergens. This ingredient is a good option for companies who make gluten free pastas, pizza crusts, or tortillas.
DF Ingredient: This product is a defatted version of rice bran that gives companies a lower cost option for adding nutrition and texture to low fat foods including bread dough, cereals, or pasta.
Meat Inclusion: A great binder for meat applications. Full details are available under the product listing on the RiceBran Technologies website.

Bran Derivatives:

RiSolubles: Water-based soluble fiber that delivers concentrated nutrition in a light powder form. Can be added to dairy and other beverages including energy drinks and smoothie mixes.
RiBalance: Highly bio-available bran product that is great for energy bars, cereals, and nutrition bars.
RiFiber: An excellent source of hypoallergenic and non-bloating fiber for a wide range of food applications including cereals, baked goods, and fiber beverages.
Rice Bran Oil: Manufactured from non-GMO sourced rice bran offering chefs and product manufacturers’ healthier oil for all of their food applications. Rice bran oil is a good source of nutrition that does not trigger allergens such as nut sourced oils or palm oil which is environmentally detrimental.

Animal Nutrition:

Equine: NutraCea Rice Bran Feed Ingredient is a good source of nutrition for horses.
Companion Pet Food: NutraCea Rice Bran Pet Food Ingredient offers a highly digestible plant-sourced protein option for pet food.

Proryza:

Proryza P-35: An all-natural protein extracted from rice bran that can be added to cereals, protein bars, and to fortified foods to increase the protein concentration delivering more nutritious foods without added flavor.
Proryza PF-20/50: Named due to its offering of 20% protein and 50% fiber offering products such as cereals, high fiber snacks, and protein bars a nutritional boost.
Proryza Platinum: Naturally sourced bulking agent derived from non-GMO rice bran. Proryza Platinum adds prebiotic dietary fiber to any formula for making delicious and nutritious meal replacement shakes, health bars, and protein powder formulas.

Purchasing RiceBran Technologies
Full product ordering details are available through the RiceBran Technologies website. The main business headquarters is located in Scottsdale, Arizona and full email and phone numbers listings are available online.
Additionally, RiceBran Technologies offers full ordering support to help companies choose the products that will work best for their application.
Whether companies are looking to sample a product or are looking to buy a large quantity RiceBran Technologies offers a range of options and supportive staff along the ordering process.
RiceBran Technologies Summary
Food manufacturing companies will want to consider looking into RiceBran Technologies to procure high quality ingredients for their products.
Whether companies are looking for a high quality bran product to add nutrition to their cereals, protein bars, or even pasta, RiceBran Technologies offers competitively priced options that offer lengthy shelf time and no added flavor problems.
With the rise of gluten allergies, offering products that do not have allergen triggering ingredients is important to remain competitive in the marketplace.
With seventeen years of business, RiceBran Technologies has become a leader in their field and offer products that can be trusted.

There is huge, untapped, potential to incorporate fibers and proteins from rice bran into bars, powdered drink mixes, and other healthy products, says a natural products formulation expert that has just agreed to sell his business to rice bran ingredients pioneer RiceBran Technologies.
 


 
Mark McKnight was speaking to FoodNavigator-USA after striking a deal to sell the company he founded - Texas-based H&N Distribution - to RiceBran Tech for an undisclosed sum.  H&N co-packs natural products and supplements for internet retailers and multi-level marketers supplying customers in the US and overseas, while RiceBran has built a business around arresting the enzymatic reaction that causes raw rice bran (a by-product of rice-milling) to deteriorate after milling such that it can stabilize the bran and produce value-added ingredients.I’ve been working with natural products for 20 years and have never seen this kind of responseThe two companies started talking about getting together after orders of nutritional drinks formulated by H&N using RiceBran Tech’s ingredients started to "really take off", said McKnight, who will join RiceBran Tech’s senior management team after the deal goes through.  “It makes sense. We’re good at formulating delicious healthy natural products and RiceBran has the raw materials we want to work with. “I’ve been working with natural products for almost 20 years and have never seen the kind of consumer response that I’ve seen to products made with these ingredients.”Other rice proteins are from the endosperm or the germinated seed  


RiceBran stabilizes rice bran in West Sacramento and then ships it to Montana for further processing into a nutrient-rich ingredient called RiBalance. This can be further separated into RiSolubles (a soluble fiber in powder form ideal for dairy and beverages) and RiFiber (an insoluble fiber suitable for multiple food applications).



 
 

RiceBran Technologies’ most recent innovation is rice bran proteins - which have a neutral taste and work well in blends - and can also be marketed as non-GMO and non-allergenic.

It has also developed two novel protein ingredients. Proryza P-35 is a 35% water-dispersible rice bran protein extract for beverage applications; and Proryza PF-20/50 is a 20% rice bran protein and 50% insoluble rice bran dietary fiber product suitable for bars, shakes, and other products.While other rice proteins are from the endosperm or the germinated seed, 70% of the nutritional value of the rice is in the bran component, claimed RiceBran Tech CEO John Short.“Of this, about 14-15% is protein, and sometimes more, whereas the protein content of the rice endosperm is more like 6-7%."We’ve seen real success lately for protein drinks and healthy fiber drinks The rice bran proteins blend really well with other proteins, but also work alone, said McKnight.



 
 

During RiceBran Tech's latest quarterly earnings call, CEO John Short said: “We’re never satisfied. We want to grow much more and we want to grow faster. But one of the things we’re seeing is that growth is faster in the human ingredient side of the business than in the animal nutrition side of the business”

“We’ve seen real success lately for protein drinks and healthy fiber drinks, but there is also a lot of interest in fiber/protein combinations and lots of opportunities in bars, shots, energy drinks and other ready-to-drink beverages.”Short said the deal to acquire H&N “not only allows us to begin an aggressive new launch of our high margin NFF [nutraceutical and functional foods] business in a multi-billion dollar worldwide market, but also brings a master formulator, consummate sales professional and experienced business manager to our senior team."Click here

RiceBran Technologies (NASDAQ: RIBT) Breaking News 
Alert- 
December 10, 2015
 



RiceBran Technologies Ships First Nutricosmetics Order to a 
Large Nationwide Retail Chain Store 

 
 Two hand creams 
formulated with rice bran oil to be available at select retail stores with an 
anticipated larger rollout in 2016
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - December 10, 2015 – RiceBran Technologies (NASDAQ:
RIBT) and (RIBTW) (the 
“Company” or “RBT”), a global leader in the production and 
marketing of value added products derived from rice bran, began to focus on the 
emerging nutricosmetics market as a significant, high margin growth opportunity 
for its rice bran, rice bran oil and rice bran derivative products in late 2014. 
Today the Company announced that it has shipped a nutricosmetics order to a 
large retail chain customer with over 4,000 stores throughout the United States. 
The two new hand cream products formulated with rice bran oil were developed by 
RBT in conjunction with the retail chain's product development team. Those hand 
creams will be available in a select number of stores immediately with a larger 
roll out anticipated to take place in 2016. 

In addition to its 4,000 store footprint, the retail chain also sells its 
branded products through 30,000 additional independent retail locations. RBT 
sees the nutricosmetics product category as a significant high margin growth 
opportunity and is in various stages of development with other high value 
customers for additional nutricosmetics product launches in the coming quarters.

Skin care products made with rice bran and rice bran oil are known to make skin 
appear younger, less wrinkled and more evenly toned. Rice bran oil is naturally 
rich in nutrients such as gamma oryzanol, tocopherols and tocotrienols. These 
nutrients can fortify skin cells and help protect the skin from oxidative 
stress. Rice bran and rice bran oil have been used for centuries in cosmetic and 
beauty products in Japan dating back to the Geishas. Rice bran based products 
are credited with providing more beautiful and younger looking skin. Today, the 
most beautiful women in Japan are still known as ‘nuka bijin’ or rice bran 
beauties.

Mark McKnight, SVP of Sales and Marketing at RBT, says: “According to NEXT: 
THE NATURAL PRODUCTS INDUSTRY FORECAST 2016, booming nutricosmetics markets in 
Japan and Europe have greatly contributed to success of the overall global 
nutricosmetics market, which is estimated to reach $5.5 billion by the year 
2018. America is also starting to catch on and RiceBran Technologies expects to 
capitalize on emerging opportunities in nutricosmetic creams and lotions, 
exfoliants and ‘beauty-from-within’ products based on rice bran formulations.”

McKnight continued, “Integrating our proprietary and patented ingredients into 
nutricosmetics is a key target for our company as we move into 2016 and we are 
excited to have developed this new customer relationship to demonstrate our 
capabilities in nutricosmetics formulations. We look forward to building a long 
and profitable relationship with this customer as we work to build our 
nutricosmetics product offerings into a significant driver of high margin 
revenue for our Company in 2016 and beyond.”
