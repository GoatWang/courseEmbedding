	SUNSTOCK,
	INC.











	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	(Unaudited)




	 





	NOTE
	1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS





	 




	Sunstock,
	Inc. (formerly known as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation) (“Sunstock” or “the Company”) was incorporated
	on July 23, 2012 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited
	to, selected mergers and acquisitions. Sunstock operations to date have been limited to issuing shares of its common stock. Sunstock
	may attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with Sunstock. The combination
	will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company
	will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or
	Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that Sunstock will be successful in locating
	or negotiating with any target company.




	 




	In
	December 2014, the Company purchased 100 ounces of silver. In 2015, the Company purchased additional precious metals for $302,429
	and shifting more of its capital to the acquisition of precious metals. The Company holds physical coins and bullion rather than
	contracts for delivery of precious metals or certificates. In time of economic crisis, there may be no guarantee of the delivery
	of precious metals as contracts and certificates may exceed available stock.




	 




	Currently,
	the Company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates
	holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings
	unless the market price exceeds $2,500.




	 





	BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION





	 




	The
	condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, which has been derived from audited financial statements and the interim unaudited
	condensed financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
	Accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities
	and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X. These condensed financial statements
	do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these
	unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and
	notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in the Company’s Form 10-K.




	 




	The
	condensed financial statements included herein as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are unaudited; however,
	they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of the Company’s management, are necessary
	to present fairly the condensed financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2017, the condensed results of its operations
	and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and the condensed cash flows for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results
	to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.




	 








	7

	 









	 








	 






	USE
	OF ESTIMATES





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Significant estimates made by the Company’s management include but are not limited to valuation of marketable securities,
	realizability of inventories and value of stock-based transactions.




	 





	INVENTORIES





	 




	Inventories
	consist of merchandise for sale and are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
	When a purchase contains multiple copies of the same item, they are stated at average cost.




	 




	Inventories
	– silver consists primarily of silver and small amounts of gold held for sale and are stated at cost. Currently, the Company
	anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates holding
	its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the
	market price exceeds $2,500.




	 




	At
	each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for
	excess quantities and obsolescence. Among other factors, the Company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation
	to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence
	and net realizable value. In addition, the Company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net
	realizable value of its inventory. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable
	values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories.




	 





	REVENUE
	RECOGNITION





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
	Certification (ASC”) Topic 605. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, product delivery and acceptance have occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the transaction
	is assured.





	 






	EARNINGS
	(LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE





	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per share represent income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common
	shares outstanding during the period which excluded unvested restricted stock. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment
	to income (loss) that would result from the assumed issuance. The potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate
	to outstanding stock options and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would
	reduce the reported loss per share and therefore have an anti-dilutive effect.




	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, there were no potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share as
	their effect would have been antidilutive for each of the periods presented.




	 





	STOCK
	BASED COMPENSATION






	 





	ASC
	718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payment
	awards to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
	rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based
	payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the
	option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of
	an entity’s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction is recognized as a liability;
	otherwise, the transaction is recognized as equity.




	 








	8

	 









	 







	 




	The
	Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
	505-50 “Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.” Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees
	is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
	issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
	completion date.




	 





	NOTE
	2 - GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of approximately $19,548,197 as
	of March 31, 2017. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
	Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
	to meet its obligaons, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders
	and/or other third parties.




	 




	These
	Condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its
	obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent
	upon financial support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations,
	successfully locating and negotiating with an acquisition target.




	 




	There
	is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to
	reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
	that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	NOTE
	3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	 





	See
	Note 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a description of recent accounting
	pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our unaudited condensed financial statements.




	 





	NOTE
	4 - RELATED PARTY BALANCES







	 






	During
	the period ended March 31, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2016, the Company was provided a non-interest bearing, non-secured
	line of credit by a shareholder.  The line is due on demand.  At March 31, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2016, the
	Company had net borrowings of approximately $30,000, which are due and payable at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 which is
	included in accounts payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. See Note 6 for shares of stock issued to related parties.

	NOTE
	5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGIENCIES





	 




	The
	Company entered into a lease agreement in December 2015 for 2,700 square feet of retail shop space to replace their previous location
	below. The lease requires combined monthly payments of base rent of $1,950 for six months beginning January 2015 with an option
	for an additional one year running through June of 2017.





	 






	LITIGATION





	 




	In
	December 2013, the Company issued 75,000 shares of common stock to a third party (the “Shareholder”) for consideration
	of $16,000. Such consideration was received directly by Jason Chang, CEO, and was not deposited into the Company’s bank
	account. As the funds had not been received by the Company, such amounts have been recorded as compensation to Mr. Chang as of
	December 31, 2014 (see Note 5). In April 2014, the Company received notice from the Shareholder that he had filed a lawsuit against
	the Company and its CEO relating to the delay in the complainants’ stock reaching public listing services. The Company had
	made efforts to settle this issue, without an agreement being reached. As such, the Company has recorded a loss contingency based
	on its best estimate of all costs to be incurred for the ultimate settlement of this matter. The Company has settled on the amount
	$82,660 up from the December 31,2015 accrued amount of $55,200 has reflected these amounts in accrued litigation on the accompanying
	balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Repayment of which is anticipated in the second quarter of 2017.




	 





	INDEMNITIES
	AND GUARANTEES





	 




	The
	Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified
	party, in relation to certain actions or transactions. The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents,
	as permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with its facility leases, the Company has agreed to indemnify
	its lessors for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies,
	and is generally tied to the life of the agreement. These guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the
	maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company entered into a lease agreement in December
	2015 for 2,700 square feet of retail shop space to replace their previous location below. The lease requires combined monthly
	payments of base rent of $1,950 for six months beginning January 2015 with an option for an additional one year running through
	June of 2017.




	 




	Historically,
	the Company has not been obligated nor incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded
	for these indemnities and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheet.




	 





	NOTE
	6 - STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.




	 




	During
	2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 330,000 shares of fully vested non-forfeitable shares of common stock to certain consultants
	of the Company to be earned over a one-year period. The shares were valued at $403,500 (based on the closing market price on the
	measurement date) of which $720 was received in cash and the remaining $402,780 have been recorded as prepaid consulting.
	The Company has amortized the final portion of this prepaid expense of $26,450 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

	NOTE
	6 - STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY (Continued)





	 




	During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 6,660,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain employees
	for future services (See Note 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 for details).
	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded $1,241,730 in stock based compensation expense related to
	the vesting terms of such restricted shares.





	 





	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company received $4,440 for the issuance of 306,000 shares of common
	stock.




	 




	During
	the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 the Company issued 120,000 shares of Common Stock to to a consultant for legal services
	to be rendered through February 28, 2018. The fair value of the stock was determined to be $116,400, of which, $6,000 is included
	in subscription receivable, and the remaining $110,400 was recorded as prepaid consulting. During the three months ended March
	31, 2017, the Company amortized $9,200 to stock based compensation expense based on the vesting term.




	 




	During
	the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the company’s CEO, Jason Chang was awarded 11.5 million shares of the Company’s
	common stock for services valued at $11,253,250 of which $2,500


	was
	received in the cash and the remaining $11,250,750 was recorded as stock based compensation expense in the accompanying statement
	of operations.

	Overview





	 




	Sunstock,
	Inc., formerly Sandgate Acquisition Corporation (“Sunstock”) was incorporated on July 23, 2012 under the laws of the
	State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.




	 




	Management
	intends to develop the Company for the acquisition and operation of hotels, discount retail stores, and residential properties
	in the high demand areas of California, particularly Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area. In December 2014, the
	Company commenced their investment in precious metals. At March 31, 2017 the Company has $413,374 in the investment account.




	 




	In
	analyzing prospective business opportunities, Sunstock may consider such matters as the available technical, financial and managerial
	resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any; prospects for the future; nature of
	present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which may be available and the depth of that
	management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk factors not now foreseeable but which
	may be anticipated; the potential for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance
	of products, services, or trades; name identification; and other relevant factors. This discussion of the proposed criteria is
	not meant to be restrictive of the virtually unlimited discretion of Sunstock to search for and enter into potential business
	opportunities.




	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, The Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of ($19,548,197)
	since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
	which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third
	parties.

	Critical

	There
	have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
	for the year ended December 31, 2016.





	 





	Recently
	Adopted Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The ASU involves several aspects of the accounting
	for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity
	or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. Certain of these changes are required to be applied retrospectively,
	while other changes are required to be applied prospectively. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public business entities for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption will be
	permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
	As a result of the adoption of this ASU as of January 1, 2017, we have made an entity-wide accounting policy election to account
	for forfeitures when they occur. There is no cumulative-effect adjustment as a result of the adoption of this ASU as our estimated
	forfeiture rate prior to adoption of this ASU was 0%. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our condensed
	financial statements and related disclosures.




	 




	In
	November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Current U.S. GAAP requires an
	entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
	financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred
	tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this
	update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred
	tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by
	the amendments in this update. The amendments in this update will align the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
	with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are effective for fiscal years after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU as of January 1, 2017 did not have a material impact on
	our condensed financial statements and related disclosures.




	 




	In
	July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. Topic 330. Inventory,
	currently requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable
	value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which
	includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure in scope inventory
	at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
	business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The amendments in this ASU more closely
	align the measurement of inventory in U.S. GAAP with the measurement of inventory in IFRS. For public business entities, the amendments
	are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments
	should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
	The adoption of this ASU as of January 1, 2017 did not have a material impact on our condensed financial statements and related
	disclosures.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
	This ASU 2014-15 describes how an entity should assess its ability to meet obligations and sets rules for how this information
	should be disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The standard provides accounting guidance that will be
	used along with existing auditing standards. The ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016.
	Early application is permitted. The adoption of this ASU as of January 1, 2017 did not have a material impact on our condensed
	financial statements and related disclosures.





	 






	Results
	of Operations





	 





	Discussion
	of the Three Months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016





	 




	The
	Company generated revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $3,596 as compared to $13,408 in revenues posted for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the reduced emphasis on retail sales to hotel
	management focus.




	 




	For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 cost of sales was $2,550 and $6,703, respectively, which was driven by the decrease
	in revenues as disclosed above. Operating expenses increased to $12,554,701 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from
	$81,893 for the same period of 2016 primarily as a result of share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company posted an operating loss of $12,553,655 as compared to an operating
	loss of $75,187 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, such increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses
	related to increase operating expenses, share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	The
	unrealized gain on investments in precious metals of $51,720 during the three months ended March 31, 2017, is related to the increase
	in the market value of the underlying assets held as of March 31, 2017.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, the Company had $718 in cash and $2,331 in inventory – products and $413,374 in inventory - silver.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $7,940 from the sale of common stock.




	 





	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	The
	Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
	effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
	expenditures or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.

	Information
	not required to be filed by Smaller reporting companies.





	 










	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	 




	Pursuant
	to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
	design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of
	the end of the fiscal year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer
	(who is also the principal financial officer). There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
	that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, he believes
	that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information
	needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized
	and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company.




	 





	Management’s
	Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	The
	Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
	the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017 based on the criteria
	establish in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
	as of March 31, 2017, based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably, not absolute, assurance that the
	objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
	have been detected.




	 







	Material
	Weaknesses




	:





	 




	A
	material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis.




	 




	The
	material weaknesses identified are:




	 




	1.
	Inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the Company’s financial statements in
	accordance with GAAP;




	 




	We
	did not employ an adequate number of people to ensure a control environment that would allow for the accurate and timely reporting
	of the financial statements.




	 




	2.
	Ineffective controls to ensure that the accounting for transactions are recorded in accordance with GAAP financial statements;




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, adjustments were made to the general ledger, which collectively could have a material effect
	on the financial statements.




	 




	Notwithstanding
	the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the financial statements
	in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition in conformity with U.S.
	generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Further, we do not believe the material weaknesses identified had an impact on
	prior financial statements.




	 








	14

	 









	 







	 





	Remediation:





	 




	As
	part of our ongoing remedial efforts, we have and will continue to, among other things:




	 




	1.
	Expanded our accounting policy and controls organization by recently hiring qualified accounting and finance personnel;




	 




	2.
	Increase our efforts to educate both our existing and expanded accounting policy and control organization on the application of
	the internal control structure;




	 




	3.
	Emphasize with management the importance of our internal control structure;




	 




	4.
	Seek outside consulting services where our existing accounting policy and control organization believes the complexity of the
	existing exceeds our internal capabilities; and




	 




	5.
	Plan to implement improved accounting systems.




	 




	We
	believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls
	and procedures. We intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to overcome
	or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until such
	time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed and remediated.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during its current fiscal quarter that
	have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

	SUNSTOCK,
	INC.










	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	(Unaudited)




	 





	NOTE
	1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS





	 




	Sunstock,
	Inc. (formerly known as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation) (“Sunstock” or “the Company”) was incorporated
	on July 23, 2012 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited
	to, selected mergers and acquisitions. Sunstock operations to date have been limited to issuing shares of its common stock. Sunstock
	may attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with Sunstock. The combination
	will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company
	will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or
	Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that Sunstock will be successful in locating
	or negotiating with any target company.




	 




	In
	December 2014, the Company purchased 100 ounces of silver. In 2015, the Company purchased additional precious metals for $302,429
	and shifting more of its capital to the acquisition of precious metals. The Company holds physical coins and bullion rather than
	contracts for delivery of precious metals or certificates. In time of economic crisis, there may be no guarantee of the delivery
	of precious metals as contracts and certificates may exceed available stock.




	 




	Currently,
	the Company anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates
	holding its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings
	unless the market price exceeds $2,500.




	 





	BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION





	 




	The
	condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements and the interim unaudited
	condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
	Accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities
	and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X. These condensed financial statements
	do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these
	unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements and
	notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company’s Form 10-K.




	 




	The
	condensed financial statements included herein as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited;
	however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of the Company’s management, are
	necessary to present fairly the condensed financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the condensed results of
	its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended Septmeber 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed cash flows for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
	not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.




	 





	USE
	OF ESTIMATES





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Significant estimates made by the Company’s management include but are not limited to valuation of marketable securities,
	realizability of inventories and value of stock-based transactions.




	 







	 



	7



	 
















	 





	INVENTORIES





	 




	Inventories
	consist of merchandise for sale and are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
	When a purchase contains multiple copies of the same item, they are stated at average cost.




	 




	Inventories
	– silver consists primarily of silver and small amounts of gold held for sale and are stated at cost. Currently, the Company
	anticipates holding its precious metals as a long term investment. Depending on market conditions, the Company anticipates holding
	its silver holdings until the market price exceeds $50. Likewise, the Company does not plan to sell its gold holdings unless the
	market price exceeds $2,500.




	 




	At
	each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for
	excess quantities and obsolescence. Among other factors, the Company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation
	to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence
	and net realizable value. In addition, the Company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net
	realizable value of its inventory. Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable
	values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories.




	 





	REVENUE
	RECOGNITION





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
	Certification (ASC”) Topic 605. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement
	exists, product delivery and acceptance have occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the transaction
	is assured.





	 






	EARNINGS
	(LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE





	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per share represent income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common
	shares outstanding during the period which excluded unvested restricted stock. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment
	to income (loss) that would result from the assumed issuance. The potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate
	to outstanding stock options and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they would
	reduce the reported loss per share and therefore have an anti-dilutive effect.




	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, there were no potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share
	as their effect would have been antidilutive for each of the periods presented.




	 





	STOCK
	BASED COMPENSATION






	 





	ASC
	718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payment
	awards to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation
	rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based
	payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the
	option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of
	an entity’s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction is recognized as a liability;
	otherwise, the transaction is recognized as equity.




	 




	The
	Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
	505-50 “Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.” Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees
	is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
	issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
	completion date.

	NOTE
	2 - GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,279,466 as of September
	30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
	which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third
	parties.




	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations
	and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial
	support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, successfully
	locating and negotiating with an acquisition target.




	 




	There
	is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to
	reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
	that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	NOTE
	3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	 





	See
	Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
	as of and the period ended June 30, 2016 for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption
	and estimated effects on our unaudited condensed financial statements.




	 





	NOTE
	4 - RELATED PARTY BALANCES





	 




	The
	Company has not incurred any salaries and related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The parents
	of the Company’s officer have contributed their time without compensation, nor any amounts due. They assist with operating
	the Company’s store. In addition, the Company receives consulting services from a shareholder without any compensation,
	nor any amounts due. The Company approximates the quarterly expense would total $15,000 to hire and pay for comparable services.
	No such amounts have been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.




	 




	In
	January 2015, the Company’s CEO has provided the Company with a revolving line of credit of up to $120,000. All principal
	and interest (5%) was due and payable in January 2016. There were no borrowings under the revolving line and it was closed in
	February 2016.




	 




	The
	Company has $30,000 of non-interest bearing, non-secured line of credit with a shareholder. The line is due on demand. At September
	30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had net borrowings of approximately $30,000 and $20,000 respectively, which are included
	in accounts payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheets. The line expires in December 2016.




	 





	NOTE
	5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGIENCIES





	 




	On
	April 8, 2014, the Company entered into a sixty-seven month lease agreement for its second retail store. The lease requires monthly
	payments of base rent of $4,756, with free rent for months one through four, month seven, month nine and month eleven. The base
	rent increases gradually over the term of the lease. This store began operations on May 8, 2014.

	LITIGATION





	 




	In
	December 2013, the Company issued 75,000 shares of common stock to a third party (the “Shareholder”) for consideration
	of $16,000. Such consideration was received directly by Jason Chang, CEO, and was not deposited into the Company’s bank
	account. As the funds had not been received by the Company, such amounts have been recorded as compensation to Mr. Chang as of
	December 31, 2014. In April 2014, the Company received notice from the Shareholder that he had filed a lawsuit against the Company
	and its CEO relating to the delay in the complainants’ stock reaching public listing services. In June, 2016 the Company
	received a judgement of $82,660, which is due on demand and has reflected this amount in accrued litigation on the accompanying
	balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and $55,200 at December 31, 2015.




	 





	INDEMNITIES
	AND GUARANTEES





	 




	The
	Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified
	party, in relation to certain actions or transactions. The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents,
	as permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with its facility leases, the Company has agreed to indemnify
	its lessors for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies,
	and is generally tied to the life of the agreement. These guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the
	maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated nor
	incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities and guarantees
	in the accompanying balance sheet.




	 





	NOTE
	6 - STOCKHOLDER’S EQUITY





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having
	a par value of $0.001 per share.




	 




	During
	the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 180,000 shares of fully vested non-forfeitable shares of common
	stock to certain consultants of the Company to be earned over a one-year period. The shares were valued at $216,000 (based on
	the closing market price on the measurement date) and have been recorded as prepaid consulting in the accompanying condensed balance
	sheet. The Company has amortized approximately $54,000 and $135,000 of such expense during the three and nine months ended September
	30, 2016, respectively




	 




	In
	February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a media consultant to create brand awareness in return for 150,000 shares
	of fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock valued at $187,500 (based on the market closing price on the measurement date) to
	be earned over a six-month period and $1,500 per each filming session. The shares are recorded as prepaid consulting expense in
	the accompanying condensed balance sheet. The Company amortized approximately $49,000 and $188,000 of consulting expense during
	the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,860,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain
	employees for future services. The unearned restricted shares have been excluded from the loss per share calculation. The Company
	also received proceeds of $2,010 related to such issuances. The total fair value of the shares of restricted common stock issued
	of $5,005,800 was based on the market price of the restricted stock on date of grant to be amortized to stock-based compensation
	expense over the term of the requisite service period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
	expensed $930,038 and $1,266,638 respectively related to the vested portion of the shares issued.




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received an aggregate of $24,767 from the issuance of 464,335 shares of
	common stock.

	intends to develop the Company for the acquisition and operation of hotels, discount retail stores, and residential properties
	in the high demand areas of California, particularly Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area. In December 2014, the
	Company commenced their investment in precious metals. At September 30, 2016 the Company has $428,663 in the investment account.
	In September 2013, new management developed plans to open and operate two retail stores in Sacramento, California. On October
	30, 2013, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Dollar Store Services, Inc. to develop, design and build out a retail
	store which the Company began operating in February 2014. Additionally, the Company entered into a lease agreement on October
	30, 2013 for 2,239 square feet of retail shop space for this store in Sacramento, California. The lease requires monthly payments
	for rent and maintenance of $3,733 for thirty six months beginning February 2014.




	 




	Management
	opened an additional retail store in Sacramento, California in May of 2014 and entered into a retail shop lease for sixty-seven
	months beginning May 2014 for approximately 4,756 square feet. The monthly base rent for this location is currently $4,756, with
	seven months of free rent throughout the first eleven months. The base rent will gradually increase until the term expires in
	2019. This store began operations on May 8, 2014 until December 2015 at which time the Company entered into a lease agreement
	for 2,700 square feet of retail shop space to replace their previous location above. The lease requires combined monthly payments
	of base rent of $1,950 for six months beginning January 2016 with a one year option.




	 




	Silver
	and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion
	bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks.
	Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver
	Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and
	precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds
	that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London
	and New York Stock Exchanges.




	 




	The
	Company believes that monetary policies adopted by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan may cause an increase
	in inflation. Gold and silver have traditionally served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and high inflation.




	 






	Going
	Concern






	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, The Company has not posted operating income since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of ($2,279,466)
	since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
	which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third
	parties.

	Results
	of Operations





	 





	Discussion
	of the Three Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015





	 




	The
	Company generated revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $9,966 as compared to $11,696 in revenues posted
	for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the closing of one of the stores in
	August 2014 and sales at the new store not at pace with the third quarter of 2015.




	 




	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 cost of sales was $5,335 and $6,668, respectively, which was driven by the
	decrease in revenues as disclosed above. Operating expenses increased to $1,063,768 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
	from $39,666 for the same period of 2015 primarily as a result of share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	During
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company posted an operating loss of $1,059,137 as compared to an operating loss
	of $34,238 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, such increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses related
	to increase operating expenses, share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	The
	unrealized loss on investments in precious metals of $1,577 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, is related to the
	decrease in the market value of the underlying assets held as of September 30, 2016.




	 





	Discussion
	of the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015





	 




	The
	Company generated revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $33,476 as compared to $48,699 in revenues posted
	for the nine ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to the closing of one of the stores in August
	2014 and sales at the new store not at pace with the first nine months of 2015.




	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the cost of sales was $17,921 and $25,036 respectively, as sales for the periods
	declined as well.




	 




	Operating
	expenses increased to $1,706,652 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $151,376 for the same period of 2015 as a result
	of share-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company posted an operating loss of $1,691,097 as compared to an operating loss
	of $127,713 for the nine months ending September 30, 2015, such increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses related
	to operating expenses, stock-based compensation and amortization of prepaid services.




	 




	The
	unrealized gain on investments in precious metals of $114,055 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is related to the
	increase in the market value of the underlying assets held as of September 30, 2016.




	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used cash in operating activities of $25,751, which was attributable to
	net loss of $1,571,996, common stock issued for services of $1,589,138 offset by unrealized gain of $114,055 in the period. During
	such period, the Company also used cash from investing activities in the amount of $12,479 for the purchase of silver inventory.




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash provided by financing activities which was attributable to cash
	proceeds of $26,777 from the sale of common stock.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company had $2,246 in cash and $23,800 in inventory – products, and $428,663 in inventory - silver.




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received proceeds of $26,777 from the sale of common stock.




	 





	Off-balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	The
	Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
	effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
	expenditures or capital resources that would be considered material to investors.

	Information
	not required to be filed by Smaller reporting companies.





	 









	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
	design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of
	the end of the fiscal year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer
	(who is also the principal financial officer). There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors
	that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, he believes
	that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information
	needed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, summarized
	and processed timely. The principal executive officer is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company.




	 





	Management’s
	Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	The
	Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
	the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria
	establish in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
	as of September 30, 2016, based on those criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably, not absolute, assurance that
	the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
	have been detected.




	 







	Material
	Weaknesses




	:





	 




	A
	material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
	be prevented or detected on a timely basis.




	 




	The
	material weaknesses identified are:




	 




	1.
	Inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the Company’s financial statements in
	accordance with GAAP;




	 




	We
	did not employ an adequate number of people to ensure a control environment that would allow for the accurate and timely reporting
	of the financial statements.




	 




	2.
	Ineffective controls to ensure that the accounting for transactions are recorded in accordance with GAAP financial statements;




	 




	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, adjustments were made to the general ledger, which collectively could have a material
	effect on the financial statements.




	 




	Notwithstanding
	the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the financial statements
	in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition in conformity with U.S.
	generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Further, we do not believe the material weaknesses identified had an impact on
	prior financial statements.




	 







	 



	13



	 
















	 





	Remediation:





	 




	As
	part of our ongoing remedial efforts, we have and will continue to, among other things:




	 




	1.
	Expanded our accounting policy and controls organization by recently hiring qualified accounting and finance personnel;




	 




	2.
	Increase our efforts to educate both our existing and expanded accounting policy and control organization on the application of
	the internal control structure;




	 




	3.
	Emphasize with management the importance of our internal control structure;




	 




	4.
	Seek outside consulting services where our existing accounting policy and control organization believes the complexity of the
	existing exceeds our internal capabilities; and




	 




	5.
	Plan to implement improved accounting systems.




	 




	We
	believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls
	and procedures. We intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to overcome
	or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until such
	time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed and remediated.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during its current fiscal quarter that
	have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

Sunstock, Inc. Launches Rehabilitation Housing Division
SACRAMENTO, CA–(Marketwired – March 8, 2017) – Sunstock, Inc. (the “Company” or “Sunstock”) (OTCBB: SSOK) announced the opening of its No-Frills Rehabilitation Housing Division.
Sunstock’s business strategy combines income producing real estate properties with investments in precious metals.  The management team with over 20 years of hospitality industry experience has identified a distinct need for clean, safe and affordable rehabilitation housing facilities.  Management has developed a plan to implement a strategy to bring no-frills rehabilitation housing facilities to the California market and eventually expand nationally.
Sunstock is in the final stage of negotiating the acquisition of a hotel in California.  After purchasing the hotel, Sunstock plans to convert the hotel to a no-frills rehabilitation housing facility that will provide a clean, safe room and transportation to clients enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program.  Sunstock has hired a management team to oversee the hotel conversion to a no-frills rehabilitation housing facility.
Sunstock’s research has discovered a high demand for these types of rehabilitation housing facilities in California. After the transfer of the hotel ownership, Sunstock forecasts this project will generate over 10 million dollars in gross revenue in the first 18 months.  Sunstock believes that this revenue prediction is sustainable and will prove to be a successful pilot project and springboard to future growth.

Sunstock, Inc.’s Silver Accumulation Plan
SACRAMENTO, CA — (Marketwired) — 02/22/16 — Sunstock, Inc. (the “Company” or “Sunstock”) (OTCBB: SSOK) has concluded that stimulative monetary policies adopted by the United States, European Union, China, and Japan have set the stage that may cause inflation to rise and increase the value of precious metals.

The spot price of silver as of February 16, 2016, was traded at $15.28 per ounce. Sunstock, Inc. believes that this precious metal is currently undervalued, and it is a strategic time to purchase more silver.

Sunstock, Inc. plans to acquire 20,000 ounces of silver by May 31, 2016, and continue to acquire an additional 20,000 ounces of silver every 90 days, thereafter, for a combined total purchase of 80,000 ounces of silver by February 28, 2017.
Upon completion of the planned additional acquisition of 80,000 ounces of silver, Sunstock, Inc. would hold a total inventory of over 100,000 ounces.
Sunstock, Inc. intends to finance the planned additional acquisition of 80,000 ounces of silver from equity sales of the Company’s securities.

Company Background

Sunstock, Inc. is a public company trading under the stock symbol SSOK.
Sunstock, Inc. was founded in 2012 and is based in Sacramento, California.
The Company was founded initially to design, develop and operate deep discount retail stores in the basic consumer goods market.
The Company operates one retail store under the Dollar Green Stores name in Sacramento, California.
The Company intends to acquire:

Income producing properties with strong cash flow.
Affordable residential properties.


The Company plans to divest up to half of it’s cash proceeds in SILVER BULLION.
The Company plans to build a recession based portfolio.

 
Executive Summary
Sunstock, Inc. intends to acquire and operate hotels, rental income properties and hold a strong position in silver commodities.
The management of Sunstock, Inc. believes that stimulative monetary policies adopted by the United States may cause an increase in dramatic inflation of the US dollar currency in the near future.  To avoid economic uncertainty, high inflation and currency losses, the Company intends to strategically target investments in hotels, residential real estate, and the precious metals market.
Sunstock, Inc. has an exciting future as its management team explores all of the new age opportunities presented by the crowdfund platform.  Crowdfunding permits traditional real estate the ability to discover and then acquire or develop properties the Company may not have otherwise known were available and broadens its target from local or regional to national.  Crowdfunding also offers Sunstock the opportunity to identify projects to potentially develop via crowdsourced funding blended in with its own financing sources.
The demand for metals is continuing alongside a growing global population that will have a greater overall need for products such as cars, computers and household goods all of which can’t be produced without metals.  Gold has been the primary accepted tangible asset used as money for thousands of years.  As a result of the recent recession, gold hit an all-time high of $1,900 an ounce in 2011.  Gold which is considered a currency and hedge against inflation has fallen by a third since 2011 to below $1,250 per ounce on average.  While the price of gold has suffered over the past five years, the metal will continue to be stored by central banks as a backup to more common currency.  On the other hand, Silver considered a hybrid metal for its use as a currency and in the industrial application has been hit the hardest in the past three years, falling by more than half to below $20 per ounce on average.  Silver is in a slump, but demand for the metal will continue given its strength and thermal conductivity, which is used in a number of industrial applications from electronics to automobiles.
By comparing the current and future economic outlook, bullion is the safe haven to protect investors against a possible catastrophe in the economic markets.  Therefore, the current significant fallen price of bullion is an opportunity for Sunstock, Inc. to invest in Gold and Silver.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling
Shareholder Shares.


The Company’s discount retail stores are part of a highly competitive industry.
The basic consumer packaged goods market encompasses discount stores and many
other retailers, including mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety
and other specialty stores. The Company’s direct competitors will include retail
companies such as ‘Dollar General’, ‘Family Dollar’, ‘Dollar Tree’, and ’99
CentOnly Store’ to the extent that these competitors are within a similar
geographic area to the Company’s stores. These competitors may have greater
financial and other resources than does the Company.

The Company intends to differentiate itself from other forms of discount retail
stores by targeting low to middle-class consumers in strategic locations in
northern California currently underserved by the dollar store channel.

If the Company does enter the hotel and or residential property industry, it
will encounter significant competition from other hotel, residential and resort
owners and operators. Primary competitors would include branded and independent
hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership
companies.


Company Description
The Company intends to acquire and operate hotels, residential properties and
dollar stores in the high demand areas of California, such as Southern
California and the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Company independently owns and operates a dollar store in Sacramento
California, and intends to open


 additional dollar store retail locations
throughout northern California. Additionally, the Company plans to begin trading
in precious metals. The Company has acquired 100 ounces of silver, a small
amount of gold, and is evaluating further positions in either the commodities
market or bullion. The Company is also interested in acquiring a medium sized
hotel in 2015. The Company may also acquire residential apartment complexes in
years subsequent to 2015.

In September 2013, the Company’s management developed plans to open and operate
two retail stores in Sacramento, California, under the name “Dollar Green
Stores.” In October 2013, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with
Dollar Store Services, Inc., a leading dollar store development and operations
consultant. The Company retained Dollar Store Services, Inc. to advise on the
development, design and build out of retail stores.

In February 2014, the Company’s first dollar store opened in Sacramento and
consists of more than 2,200 square feet of retail store space. In May 2014, the
Company opened its second retail storefront consisting of more than 4,700 square
feet. The Company intends to open additional dollar stores in 2014 and
thereafter pursue expansion into strategic locations currently underserved by
the dollar store channel. In August 2014, the Company’s first retail store
closed for reasons unrelated to the Company’s business. Hence, the Company
currently has only one store open for business.

The Company’s dollar stores offer a wide selection of consumable merchandise
products including packaged food comprised of cereals, canned soups, milk, eggs,
vegetables, frozen and refrigerated foods, candies, cookies, crackers, salty
snacks, carbonated beverages, over-the-counter medicines and personal care
products, such as soap, body wash, shampoo, dental hygiene products, as well as
skin, and foot care products. Additional products include gifts, party goods,
toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, pet supplies, pet food,
gardening supplies, durable housewares, kitchen supplies, cookware, paper
products, plastics, household chemicals, and many other items, including
seasonal goods, such as Easter, Halloween, and Christmas merchandise.

Currently, the Company owns no hotel or residential properties. Althoughthe
Company has no plans to purchase a hotel or residential apartment complex in the
immediate future, The Company may do so in 2015, andis evaluating potential
target properties.

The Company also intends to begin trading precious metals. On December 19, 2014,
the Company purchased 100 ounces of silver. The Company has since purchased gold
and is evaluating potentially expanding its ownership of additional precious
metals.
