Dividends on the issuer common stock held in the issuer stock fund are included in the unit value. The number of shares of issuer stock attributable to the reporting person can be determined at any time by first multiplying the number of units in the reporting person's account by the then current unit price and dividing the total by the price of the issuer common stock. As of 1/10/2012, the reporting person held an equivalent of 1104.29 shares in the issuer 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) plan is a"Qualified Plan" as defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(4).
