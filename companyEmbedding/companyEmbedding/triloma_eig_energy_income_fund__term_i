ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Triloma Financial Group ("Triloma") and EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the "Fund"), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer. 
"Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma's strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners," said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. "Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world."
"The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions," said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. "Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma's team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform." 
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: "We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG's experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis."

                    Triloma Continues Growth, Signs Lease for Additional Office Space
                




                  ORLANDO, Fla. (March 15, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it has leased an additional 9,500 square feet of space in its current downtown Winter Park office building, bringing its total office space to over 17,000 square feet.
                


                    “Having this additional space available will allow us to accommodate our growing team,” explained managing director, Mike Wood. “More importantly, it affirms our commitment to Winter Park, and we’re excited for what the future holds for us here.”
                  

                    To accommodate its rapidly growing team, Triloma has expanded its offices three times since initially leasing 1,763 square feet of space on Park Avenue in late 2013. One of the ways the firm seeks to promote a healthy work/life balance for its associates is by keeping daily commutes as short as possible, which ultimately led Triloma to its current building just a block away on New York Avenue.
                  

                    Triloma now has 58 associates, each averaging 16 years of investment industry experience. The firm has two public investment offerings currently available, and will continue to offer a series of private investment opportunities this year. Additionally, Triloma intends to introduce new products for 2017 in response to the ever-changing investment and regulatory environments.
                  

                    This announcement comes on the heels of Triloma reporting more than $200 million in equity capital raised in 2016, as well as plans for continued growth and increased involvement in industry advocacy in 2017.

We continue to make it our priority as a firm to improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates, and we believe our success to be a direct result of this focus.”
                  

                    In 2017, the firm plans to continue to expand its selling syndicate for the Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds, add additional talent to its operations teams, and further diversify its platform of products.
                  

                    Triloma also will increase its involvement in the Investment Program Association (IPA), the financial service industry’s leading education and advocacy body for Direct Investment programs.

                    Triloma Announces 2015 Growth Activity
                




Investment firm exceeds equity raising goals in its first year of operations

                  ORLANDO, Fla. (Feb. 17, 2016) – Triloma Securities (“Triloma”) announced today the results of its syndication activity in 2015. The firm, which commenced broker-dealer operations on April 23, 2015, surpassed its equity raising goals for the year in just over eight months.
                


                    In 2015, Triloma raised more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings, marking one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date. As part of its capital raising efforts, Triloma signed 57 selling agreements with 23
                    different retail broker-dealer firms throughout the year, with investment offerings in energy, seniors housing and land development.
                  

                    “When we founded Triloma, our goal was to create a company where we could improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities. “As we look back at an extraordinary first year for
                    our firm, we have exceeded that goal. We are also proud to have three outstanding investment partners, and to have added to our team some of the brightest and most experienced professionals in our industry.”
                  

                    In the last year, Triloma and its affiliate, Triloma Financial Group, have grown from 9 to 46 associates. These associates include industry veterans who average 15 years of experience in the investment industry. To accommodate this strategic
                    growth, the company relocated to a larger office in Winter Park, Florida.
                  

                    Plans for continued growth in 2016 are well underway, as Triloma prepares to expand its presence in the broker-dealer community.

Apr 26, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- ORLANDO, FL--(Marketwired - April 26, 2017) - Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I (the "Funds") announced today their participation, alongside certain other private funds and accounts managed by EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG"), in a $300 million Senior Secured First Lien Note issuance by Northeast Natural Energy and its affiliates ("NNE"). The transaction was originated, negotiated and structured by EIG on behalf of its managed investment vehicles and the Funds.  NNE is a privately held oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of natural gas assets within the Appalachian basin. The floating rate notes mature in five years and are secured by mortgages on the proved reserves in addition to other assets.  "We continue to diversify the Funds' portfolios geographically, across energy infrastructure sub-sectors and different geologic basins," said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of the Funds. "This investment in Northeast Natural Energy is another strong addition featuring natural gas production primarily in West Virginia and western Pennsylvania."  This addition to the portfolio closely follows the Funds' second international investment in a large renewable power project located in the United Kingdom.  About Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I  Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I are unlisted investment companies that invest primarily in global portfolios of privately originated energy company and project debt. Their investment objectives are to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Funds are managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, wholly owned subsidiaries of Triloma Financial Group and EIG Global Energy Partners, respectively. For additional information, please visit trilomaenergy.com.

Triloma Financial Group is the parent company to Triloma Securities, a FINRA-registered broker-dealer, and Triloma Energy Advisors, an SEC-registered investment adviser, (collectively referred to herein as "Triloma"). Triloma Energy Advisors serves as the investment adviser to the Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds.  Securities offered through Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC.  Triloma, EIG Global Energy Partners, and Northeast Natural Energy are not affiliated.  About EIG Global Energy Partners  EIG Global Energy Partners (EIG) is a leading institutional investor to the global energy sector with $14.4 billion under management as of December 31, 2016. EIG specializes in private investments in energy and energy-related infrastructure on a global basis.

The respective offerings of Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund and Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund - Term I (the "Funds") common stock can be made solely by means of a written prospectus forming part of the effective registration statement. The prospectuses and their supplements, which contain important information about the Funds, can be obtained upon request and without charge by writing to the Funds at 201 N. New York Ave., Suite 250, Winter Park, FL 32789, or by calling the Funds collect at 407-636-7115. Prospective investors should read the prospectuses and their supplements carefully before investing. Investors are advised to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectuses contain this and other information about the Funds. There can be no assurance that the Funds will achieve their investment objectives.  The Funds' investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated and unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature. Investments in senior secured debt present additional risks, including that there is a higher risk of default than with investment-grade bonds. Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations. The Funds' investments in energy companies expose the Funds to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, a higher volatility of the market and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Funds than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Triloma, EIG and the Funds believe these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Fund's registration statement, as such factors may be updated from time to time in its periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are accessible on the SEC's website at sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in the Fund's filings. Triloma, EIG and the Funds assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events or circumstances.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Investments in senior secured debt present additional risks, including that there is a higher risk of default than with investment-grade bonds. Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations. The Funds' investments in energy companies expose the Funds to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, a higher volatility of the market and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Funds than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries.This press release may contain forward-looking statements identified by the use of words such as "outlook," "indicator," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
