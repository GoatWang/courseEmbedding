Our summer program is a chance for you to get to know us better, experience our unique culture and find out what it's like to be a Paul, Weiss lawyer.
Choose Your Own Program
You'll have the opportunity to shape your summer experience at Paul, Weiss. Choose one department to call your home, or select a variety of work from a number of different practice areas. It's up to you.
 



You'll be matched with a team of lawyers including associates, counsel and partners
In addition to your team, you'll be paired with a partner and an associate who will provide guidance and advice about your summer work


 



You'll receive training in both substantive areas of law and practical legal skills in a mix of highly interactive small group trainings, individual skills development workshops and more traditional classroom-style presentations
You'll have unlimited opportunities to work on pro bono matters


 




From Broadway to baseball games, you'll have plenty of opportunities to get to know your fellow summers, firm associates and partners



 
When you summer with us, we take every opportunity to show you why your work matters and how it will make a difference — whether it's by having you sit in on a merger negotiation, deposition, or conference call, or bringing you to court.









New York
While you enhance your professional skills by attending trials, depositions, closings and client meetings, you will also have the opportunity to experience the best of summer in the city — from sailing around Manhattan to Yankees games to Shakespeare in the Park. There are plenty of opportunities for informal socializing, including an evening at the Museum of Modern Art. At the annual MoMA Reception, more than 700 guests mingle in the Sculpture Garden and roam the galleries while enjoying world-class food, music and art.
 
Washington, D.C.
In our Washington, D.C. office, you will have the opportunity to work on the same variety of litigation and regulatory matters as in the New York office, but in a smaller office environment. This collegial setting allows the D.C. office to offer its unique three-day summer associate mock trial program, which is judged by the partners in the office. Other highlights include weekly lunches featuring high-profile D.C. denizens, including government officials; touring the capital’s landmarks; sporting events; and an evening at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. There will also be opportunities to join Paul, Weiss summer associates from the firm’s other offices for some of our most popular social events in New York City.









 
Asia Track Summer Program
Our summer programs in China and Japan are designed for students who have a demonstrated interest in broadening their experience globally and pursuing their careers in Asia in the longer term.



China Practice This summer program gives summer associates the opportunity to split their time between New York and China. Based in our Beijing or Hong Kong office, summer associates will have the opportunity to work as part of the firm’s China Practice on sophisticated and complex international cross-border M&A, private equity investments and financing transactions in a small office environment. Upon graduation, typically associates spend up to two years in our Corporate Department in New York, and are then given the option to transfer to Beijing or Hong Kong to continue their career.
Japan Practice This summer program is designed for summer associates who have an interest in either Corporate or Litigation and gives summer associates the opportunity to split their time between New York and Tokyo. In our Tokyo office, the summer associates will have the opportunity to work on a variety of capital markets, cross-border M&A transactions, litigation, FCPA and regulatory matters in a small office environment. Upon graduation, associates interested in our Japan Practice can start their careers in either the Corporate or Litigation Departments in either New York or Tokyo.




London
Our summer program in London offers a unique learning experience in a truly global setting. The program begins with several weeks in New York and continues in London. Summers work with leading practitioners on global capital markets transactions, cross-border M&A, private equity investments and financings. In addition to honing your professional skills, you will be able to participate in our most popular New York social events and then enjoy all of the attractions of the British capital.
 
Toronto
