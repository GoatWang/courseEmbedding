Early life[edit]
Born September 4, 1958, Hubbard was raised in Apopka, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. His father taught at a local community college and his mother taught at a high school. Hubbard's younger brother, Gregg, is a member of the country-pop band Sawyer Brown.[4]
Hubbard is an Eagle Scout. A member of the chess team, he was a stellar student who graduated at the top of his class. He scored well enough on his College Level Examination Program to enter the University of Central Florida with enough credits to graduate with two degrees in three years. He obtained his B.A. and B.S. degrees summa cum laude from the University of Central Florida in 1979, and his masters and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
Academic[edit]
Hubbard has been at Columbia University since 1988, being Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics since 1994.[5]
He was named Dean of Columbia Business School on July 1, 2004.
Government[edit]
Hubbard was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1991 to 1993.[3]
From February 2001 until March 2003, Hubbard was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. A supply-side economist, he was instrumental in the design of the 2003 Bush Tax cuts[6]—an issue which split the economics profession on ideological lines, with those leaning left opposed and those leaning right supportive. See Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts.
He was tipped by some media outlets to be a candidate for the position of Chairman of the Federal Reserve when Alan Greenspan retired, although he was not nominated for the position.[6]
Political advisor[edit]
Hubbard served as economic advisor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney,[7] a position he also held during Romney's 2008 presidential campaign.[8] In August 2012, Politico identified Hubbard as "a likely Romney appointee as Federal Reserve chairman or Treasury secretary".[9][10]
Hubbard was an economic advisor for Bush'16.[15] After Trump became the presumptive nominee, Hubbard was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary (which eventually went to Steven Mnuchin),[16][12] and also as a potential Fed chair, a role expected to become open in February 2018.[17][16] Hubbard had been critical of both Trump and Clinton, including after Bush had suspended.[24] In August 2016, Hubbard declined say which candidate he supported in the general election,[25] but did say that Trump's taxation plans and their impact on economic growth were in a "direction" somewhat better than Clinton's plans.[26] Hubbard criticized Trump's plans on trade and immigration for their predicted economic impact.[27]
Other[edit]
Hubbard serves as co-chair of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.

Hubbard is a member of the Board of Directors of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., BlackRock Closed-End Funds, Capmark Financial Corporation, Duke Realty Corporation, KKR Financial Corporation and Ripplewood Holdings. He is also a Director or Trustee of the Economic Club of New York, Tax Foundation, Resources for the Future, Manhattan Council and Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, and a member of the Advisory Board of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse... Director of MetLife and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company since February 2007.[5]

Hubbard is currently a board member of:

Automatic Data Processing[28]
BlackRock Fin.[29]
Duke Realty[30]
KKR Fin. Corp.
Ripplewood Holdings
MetLife Inc.[5]
FiscalNote[31]

Inside Job interview and aftermath[edit]
Hubbard was interviewed in Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning documentary film, Inside Job (2010), discussing his advocacy, as chief economic advisor to the Bush Administration, of deregulation. Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 international banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible conflict of interest. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, "You have three more minutes; give it your best shot."[32] After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.[33] (Columbia Business School professor Michael Feiner, a member of the faculty committee of Columbia's Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. Center for Leadership and Ethics, has recommended that the film be shown to all business school students.[33]) One of Hubbard's consulting contracts was examined in a deposition in 2012. His work for Countrywide Financial for $1200/hr, attesting that the lender's loans were no worse than a control group of mortgages and not fraudulent, was examined by an attorney for MBIA. MBIA was suing Countrywide over its mortgage practices.[34]
Columbia Business School (CBS) Follies[edit]
Hubbard is also frequently featured in skits by Columbia Business School's "Follies" group, ranging from videos of him monitoring students on classroom video cameras[35] to songs about his relationship with Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[36] Hubbard has also publicized his dissatisfaction with Ben Bernanke's nomination as Chair of the Federal Reserve with his comedic YouTube parody of "Every Breath You Take", "Every Breath Bernanke Takes".[37]

During the program, Ferguson explained to Ms. Block, "Well, the entire interview was fairly contentious, as you can imagine. It surprised me somewhat to realize that these people were not used to being challenged, that they'd never been questioned about this issue before. They clearly expected to be deferred to by me and I think by everybody."

Early life[edit]
Born September 4, 1958, Hubbard was raised in Apopka, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. His father taught at a local community college and his mother taught at a high school. Hubbard's younger brother, Gregg, is a member of the country-pop band Sawyer Brown.[4]
Hubbard is an Eagle Scout. A member of the chess team, he was a stellar student who graduated at the top of his class. He scored well enough on his College Level Examination Program to enter the University of Central Florida with enough credits to graduate with two degrees in three years. He obtained his B.A. and B.S. degrees summa cum laude from the University of Central Florida in 1979, and his masters and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
Academic[edit]
Hubbard has been at Columbia University since 1988, being Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics since 1994.[5]
He was named Dean of Columbia Business School on July 1, 2004.
Government[edit]
Hubbard was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1991 to 1993.[3]
From February 2001 until March 2003, Hubbard was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. A supply-side economist, he was instrumental in the design of the 2003 Bush Tax cuts[6]—an issue which split the economics profession on ideological lines, with those leaning left opposed and those leaning right supportive. See Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts.
He was tipped by some media outlets to be a candidate for the position of Chairman of the Federal Reserve when Alan Greenspan retired, although he was not nominated for the position.[6]
Political advisor[edit]
Hubbard served as economic advisor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney,[7] a position he also held during Romney's 2008 presidential campaign.[8] In August 2012, Politico identified Hubbard as "a likely Romney appointee as Federal Reserve chairman or Treasury secretary".[9][10]
Hubbard was an economic advisor for Bush'16.[15] After Trump became the presumptive nominee, Hubbard was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary (which eventually went to Steven Mnuchin),[16][12] and also as a potential Fed chair, a role expected to become open in February 2018.[17][16] Hubbard had been critical of both Trump and Clinton, including after Bush had suspended.[24] In August 2016, Hubbard declined say which candidate he supported in the general election,[25] but did say that Trump's taxation plans and their impact on economic growth were in a "direction" somewhat better than Clinton's plans.[26] Hubbard criticized Trump's plans on trade and immigration for their predicted economic impact.[27]
Other[edit]
Hubbard serves as co-chair of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.

Hubbard is a member of the Board of Directors of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., BlackRock Closed-End Funds, Capmark Financial Corporation, Duke Realty Corporation, KKR Financial Corporation and Ripplewood Holdings. He is also a Director or Trustee of the Economic Club of New York, Tax Foundation, Resources for the Future, Manhattan Council and Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, and a member of the Advisory Board of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse... Director of MetLife and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company since February 2007.[5]

Hubbard is currently a board member of:

Automatic Data Processing[28]
BlackRock Fin.[29]
Duke Realty[30]
KKR Fin. Corp.
Ripplewood Holdings
MetLife Inc.[5]
FiscalNote[31]

Inside Job interview and aftermath[edit]
Hubbard was interviewed in Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning documentary film, Inside Job (2010), discussing his advocacy, as chief economic advisor to the Bush Administration, of deregulation. Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 international banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible conflict of interest. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, "You have three more minutes; give it your best shot."[32] After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.[33] (Columbia Business School professor Michael Feiner, a member of the faculty committee of Columbia's Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. Center for Leadership and Ethics, has recommended that the film be shown to all business school students.[33]) One of Hubbard's consulting contracts was examined in a deposition in 2012. His work for Countrywide Financial for $1200/hr, attesting that the lender's loans were no worse than a control group of mortgages and not fraudulent, was examined by an attorney for MBIA. MBIA was suing Countrywide over its mortgage practices.[34]
Columbia Business School (CBS) Follies[edit]
Hubbard is also frequently featured in skits by Columbia Business School's "Follies" group, ranging from videos of him monitoring students on classroom video cameras[35] to songs about his relationship with Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[36] Hubbard has also publicized his dissatisfaction with Ben Bernanke's nomination as Chair of the Federal Reserve with his comedic YouTube parody of "Every Breath You Take", "Every Breath Bernanke Takes".[37]

Early life[edit]
Born September 4, 1958, Hubbard was raised in Apopka, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. His father taught at a local community college and his mother taught at a high school. Hubbard's younger brother, Gregg, is a member of the country-pop band Sawyer Brown.[4]
Hubbard is an Eagle Scout. A member of the chess team, he was a stellar student who graduated at the top of his class. He scored well enough on his College Level Examination Program to enter the University of Central Florida with enough credits to graduate with two degrees in three years. He obtained his B.A. and B.S. degrees summa cum laude from the University of Central Florida in 1979, and his masters and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
Academic[edit]
Hubbard has been at Columbia University since 1988, being Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and Economics since 1994.[5]
He was named Dean of Columbia Business School on July 1, 2004.
Government[edit]
Hubbard was Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Treasury from 1991 to 1993.[3]
From February 2001 until March 2003, Hubbard was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. A supply-side economist, he was instrumental in the design of the 2003 Bush Tax cuts[6]—an issue which split the economics profession on ideological lines, with those leaning left opposed and those leaning right supportive. See Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts.
He was tipped by some media outlets to be a candidate for the position of Chairman of the Federal Reserve when Alan Greenspan retired, although he was not nominated for the position.[6]
Political advisor[edit]
Hubbard served as economic advisor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney,[7] a position he also held during Romney's 2008 presidential campaign.[8] In August 2012, Politico identified Hubbard as "a likely Romney appointee as Federal Reserve chairman or Treasury secretary".[9][10]
Hubbard was an economic advisor for Bush'16.[15] After Trump became the presumptive nominee, Hubbard was mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary (which eventually went to Steven Mnuchin),[16][12] and also as a potential Fed chair, a role expected to become open in February 2018.[17][16] Hubbard had been critical of both Trump and Clinton, including after Bush had suspended.[24] In August 2016, Hubbard declined say which candidate he supported in the general election,[25] but did say that Trump's taxation plans and their impact on economic growth were in a "direction" somewhat better than Clinton's plans.[26] Hubbard criticized Trump's plans on trade and immigration for their predicted economic impact.[27]
Other[edit]
Hubbard serves as co-chair of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.

Hubbard is a member of the Board of Directors of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., BlackRock Closed-End Funds, Capmark Financial Corporation, Duke Realty Corporation, KKR Financial Corporation and Ripplewood Holdings. He is also a Director or Trustee of the Economic Club of New York, Tax Foundation, Resources for the Future, Manhattan Council and Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York, and a member of the Advisory Board of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse... Director of MetLife and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company since February 2007.[5]

Hubbard is currently a board member of:

Automatic Data Processing[28]
BlackRock Fin.[29]
Duke Realty[30]
KKR Fin. Corp.
Ripplewood Holdings
MetLife Inc.[5]
FiscalNote[31]

Inside Job interview and aftermath[edit]
Hubbard was interviewed in Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning documentary film, Inside Job (2010), discussing his advocacy, as chief economic advisor to the Bush Administration, of deregulation. Ferguson argues that deregulation led to the 2008 international banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch. In the interview, Ferguson asks Hubbard to enumerate the firms from whom he receives outside income as an advisory board member in the context of possible conflict of interest. Hubbard, hitherto cooperative, declines to answer and threatens to end the interview with the remark, "You have three more minutes; give it your best shot."[32] After the release of the film, Columbia ramped up ongoing efforts to strengthen and clarify their conflict of interest disclosure requirements.[33] (Columbia Business School professor Michael Feiner, a member of the faculty committee of Columbia's Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. Center for Leadership and Ethics, has recommended that the film be shown to all business school students.[33]) One of Hubbard's consulting contracts was examined in a deposition in 2012. His work for Countrywide Financial for $1200/hr, attesting that the lender's loans were no worse than a control group of mortgages and not fraudulent, was examined by an attorney for MBIA. MBIA was suing Countrywide over its mortgage practices.[34]
Columbia Business School (CBS) Follies[edit]
Hubbard is also frequently featured in skits by Columbia Business School's "Follies" group, ranging from videos of him monitoring students on classroom video cameras[35] to songs about his relationship with Presidential candidate Mitt Romney.[36] Hubbard has also publicized his dissatisfaction with Ben Bernanke's nomination as Chair of the Federal Reserve with his comedic YouTube parody of "Every Breath You Take", "Every Breath Bernanke Takes".[37]

During the program, Ferguson explained to Ms. Block, "Well, the entire interview was fairly contentious, as you can imagine. It surprised me somewhat to realize that these people were not used to being challenged, that they'd never been questioned about this issue before. They clearly expected to be deferred to by me and I think by everybody."

Nominal Contracting and Price Flexibility in Product Markets

 NBER Working Paper No. w1738


36 Pages
Posted: 19 Jun 2004
		
			 
		
	

R. Glenn Hubbard Columbia Business School - Finance and Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)Robert J. Weiner George Washington University - Department of International Business

Date Written: October 1985

Abstract
The search for microeconomic foundations of non-Walrasian outcomes in labor and product markets has spawned many studies of contracting. This paper emphasizes the role of contracts for market equilibrium -- for many raw materials and basic industrial commodities -- in which long-term contractual arrangements and spot markets coexist. Our principal goals are two -- (i) to explain the existence of contracts and the equilibrium fraction of trades carried out under contract, and (ii) to consider the impact of demand and supply shocks on spot prices when market trades also take place through long-term contracts. We find that the relative importance of contracting depends on, inter alia, the variance of the spot price and the sources of underlying fluctuations. Consistent with the findings of previous macroeconomic studies, we find that contracting and price rigidity are more likely the more important demand shocks are relative to supply shocks. We adapt our static model of contract price and quantity determination to discuss the adjustment of contract prices. Finally, we discuss three important applications of our multiple-price modeling structure -- to (i) analyses of the effects of changes in vertical market structure on market equilibrium in commodity markets (with specific reference to petroleum and copper), (ii) models of the optimal degree of contract indexation,and (iii) aggregate studies of "sticky prices" in macroeconomics.

A key finding is a dramatic narrowing of the spread between the margins of concentrated and unconcentrated industries over this period. We provide evidence that this narrowing is a result of the greater sensitivity of price-cost margins in more concentrated industries to demand fluctuations.

Many central bankers, especially from the U.S., have contributed to the new credit view approach of policy transmission in 1990s which proposes that in addition to the traditional interest-rate channel/money view, credit market imperfections play a crucial role in explaining the effects of monetary policies on economy (SeeGilchrist (1993), Bernanke (1993), Bernanke andGertler (1995), Cecchetti (1995), Hubbard (1994, Oliner andRudebusch (1996)). There exists an agreement that money view and credit view share a common starting point and are complementary, which implies the simultaneous coexistence of the two transmission channels. Perspectives on Monetary Policy and Cost of Capital: Evidence from Turkey[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The target of monetary policy is generally set as to create an environment of manageable employment and affordable long-Term interest rates. However, priorities of central banks may differ depending on economic and financial circumstances of individual countries. Modern approaches to monetary policy transmission can be grouped under two headings, Money View and Credit View. The money view concentrates on interest rates to explain the effects of monetary policy on aggregate spending by creating an interest rate channel. The credit channel transmission approach focuses on the supply of credits by banks following a monetary policy shift in interest rates. In 2010, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) developed an interest rate corridor shaped by one-week and overnight repo lending to the financial banks to absorb excessive volatility caused by short-Term capital inflows. Under this framework, the CBT implements its monetary policy in two ways; firstly it can alter the interest rates of weekly repo as well as O/N lending rate. Secondly, it can configure the funding structure it provides to the financial intermediaries. In such a framework, the interest rate transmission mechanism has been operated by two benchmark interest rates, one of which is the weighted average of the cost of funds provided by the CBT and the other is the interest rate in Borsa Istanbul (BIST) money market transactions at an overnight maturity. There is a strong co-movement between the interest rates and they are affected by the movements in the CBT lending rate in both directions. Interest rates applied to deposits and loans by banks are affected by the policy rate (CBT Average Funding Rate) and the market rate (BIST O/N Repo Rate).

This latter effect seems to have been important in explaining investment in oil drilling equipment, which was expensed (see Hubbard and Reiss, 1988). Thus so long as firms faced upward sloping cost of fund schedules, these various influences could lead us to underestimate some firms' external finance costs. Internal Finance and Investment: Evidence from the Undistributed Profits Tax of 1936-37[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Theoretical work on financing costs under asymmetric information has linked shifts in firm's internal funds and investment spending, holding constant investment opportunities. An impediment to convincing tests of these models is the lack of firm-level data on the relative costs of internal and external funds. The authors use a tax experiment, the surtax on undistributed profits in the 1930s, to identify firms' relative cost of internal and external funds by calculating surtax margins. The investment of high-surtax-margin firms was sensitive to shifts in cash flow, holding constant investment opportunities. Other firms did not display sensitivity of investment to internal funds.

CalomirisRead full-textEquilibrium in international markets under the classical gold standard simultaneously determined gold-denominated interest rates and specie flows to equilibrate the markets for goods and money (Calomiris and Hubbard 1996). The supply of national bank notes adjusted endogenously to the level of interest rates set in the money market. Resolving the puzzle of the underissuance of national bank notes[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Much of the puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes can be resolved for the period 1880–1900 (the period when detailed, bank-level data are available) by disaggregating, taking account of regulatory limits, and considering differences in banks’ opportunity costs cross-sectionally and over time. Banks with poor lending opportunities issued more, within regulatory limits. Banks tended to issue more when bond yields (the backing for notes) were high relative to lending opportunities. The profitability of note issuance was insufficient to attract entrants primarily or mainly for the purpose of note issuance. The observed lack of a general relationship between note issuance and reserve demand is inconsistent with the view that redemption costs from note issuance explain low note issuance in general. However, some variation in the propensities of urban banks to issue notes is associated with variation in reserve demand costs associated with the note issues of those banks. Generally, however, note issuance enjoyed economies of scope with deposit banking, including reduced costs of reserve requirements. Full-text · Article · Dec 2004 Charles W. CalomirisJoseph MasonRead full-textAlthough SFAS 123 discusses the measurement bias issue that arises from using pricing models for exchange-traded options to value employee stock options, the adjustments discussed in SFAS 123 are subjective and may not address all value-relevant differences. In addition, there is not a consensus among financial economists as to which pricing model provides the most reliable fair value estimate for SOC (Hassett and Wallison 2003; Calomiris and Hubbard 2004). Do Voluntary Disclosures that Disavow the Reliability of Mandated Fair Value Information Reflect Legitimate Concerns About Reliability?[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: One consequence of the shift to fair value measurement is the emergence of voluntary disclosures in audited financial statements that question the reliability of mandated fair value information. We refer to these disclosures as reliability disavowals and address three questions: Are fair value estimates less reliable for firms that disavow? Do managers of disavowal firms have reason to believe that they cannot reliably estimate the disavowed fair values? Are factors indicative of reliability problems associated with the decision to disavow? We address these questions in the context of managers’ stock option compensation estimates disclosed under SFAS 123. Our results suggest reliability disavowals reflect legitimate reliability concerns, consistent with managers believing that supplemental disclosures about fair value estimates provide useful information about the limitations of the estimates, which is the FASB’s position in SFAS 157.

FredericksonMarilyn Frances JohnsonMelissa Fay Lewis-WesternMelissa Fay Lewis-WesternRead full-textIn a standard model with imperfect competition, a firm's profit maximization yields an optimal price that is a markup over marginal costs. We take stock of the rich industrial organization literature (Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen 1988, Rotemberg and Woodford 1992, for Italy, Marchetti 2001) and define markups as a function of a time-invariant sector component related to technology and market structure, the level of demand (cyclical markups, demand), firm size (size), the degree of competition and, in line with Bernard et al. (2003) and Ottaviano (2003), firm total factor productivity (tfp). We make a distinction between domestic (domcomp) and foreign competition, and we further break down the latter into import penetration from China (impen china) and from the rest of the world (impen other). The Age of the Dragon: The Effect of Imports from China on Firm-Level Prices[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We analyze the impact of increased import penetration from China on the dynamics of firm-level output prices in Italy. Accounting for potential endogeneity biases we find a significant and negative causal relationship: a 0.1 percentage point higher Chinese import penetration restrains price growth by 0.17 percentage points per year. This relationship reflects a procompetitive effect induced by cheaper imports, and, thanks to the firm-level dimension of our data, we show that it is driven by low-productivity firms within less skill-intensive sectors. Finally, we show that Chinese import competition also had a dampening effect on Italian overall inflation.

Credit spread or default spread has long been used in the literature as a proxy of credit market conditions, see for example Chen, Roll andRoss (1986), Gertler,Hubbard and Kashyap (1990), Kashyap, Lamont andStein (1994), Keim andStambaugh (1986), Perez-Quiros andTimmermann (2000), Griffin, Ji and Martin (2003), Gulen, Xingand Zhang (2011), etc. We define credit spread as the difference in yields between high-yield corporate bond 4 and 10-year UK government bond. Macroeconomic Determinants of Cyclical Variations in Value, Size and Momentum Premium in the UK[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The paper examines the asymmetries in size, value and momentum premium over the economic cycles in the UK and their macroeconomic determinants. Using Markov switching approach we find clear evidence of cyclical variations of the three premiums, most noticeably variations in size premium. We associate Markov switching regime 1 with economic upturn and regime 2 with economic downturn as per OECD’s Composite Leading Indicator. The macroeconomic indicators prompting such cyclicality the most are interest rates, term structure and credit spread. The role of GDP growth, money supply and inflation is less pronounced in our sample. Full-text · Article · Jan 2014 Golam SarwarCesario MateusNatasa TodorovicRead full-textThe first critique is particularly important because the positive sensitivity of investment and cash flows can be a sign of higher investment opportunities, not financial constraints. To overcome the endogeneity problem, some authors suggest quasi-experimental methods (treatment effects) analysing the existence of financially constrained firms (Calomiris, Hubbard, 1995;Blanchard, Lopez-de-Silanes, Schleifer, 1994;Lamont, 1997;Rauh, 2006;Almeida et al., 2012;Lemmon, Roberts, 2010). An alternative approach is to use survey methods (seeCampello et al., 2010;Šonje, Kukavčić, 2014). Estimation of the firm‘s balance sheet channel effects during the economic crisis: Case of Croatia[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Economic theory recognizes the importance of the firm’s balance sheet channel. This stands in stark contrast to the neoclassical theory of investment. This paper analyses the response of firms to the economic crisis in the sample of Croatian firms. Our main variables of interest are investment and employment. We estimated the OLS model that accounts for a heterogeneous response to the crisis shock of differently leveraged firms. The empirical model is augmented so that it accounts for industry and county effects. The robustness checks are performed for different dependent as well as control variables and interactions. The results strongly and robustly confirm the importance of the firm’s balance sheet channel.

More specifically, medical expenses hit the budget constraint (as inHubbard et al. (1995) andHubbard et al. (1994)) as an exogenous shock to resources. The budget constraint is thus modified as follows Saving and wealth inequality[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Why are some people wealth rich while others are poor? To what extent can governments affect inequality? Which instruments should they use? Answering these questions requires understanding why people save. Dynamic quantitative models of wealth inequality can help us to understand and quantify the determinants of the outcomes that we observe in the data and to evaluate the consequences of policy reform. This paper surveys the savings mechanisms generated by the transmission of bequests and human capital, by preference heterogeneity, by rate of return heterogeneity, by entrepreneurship, by richer earnings processes, and by medical expenses. It concludes that the transmission of bequests and human capital, entrepreneurship, and medical-expense risk are crucial determinants of savings and wealth inequality and that we need to look at more data to measure their relative importance.

Typically, a firm or farm would make the threshold investment itself to mitigate the effects of a shock. Climate-smart food supply chains in developing countries in an era of rapid dual change in agrifood systems and the climate[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Food supply chains are essential to food security in developing regions where today the great majority of food consumed is purchased from rural-urban, rural-rural, and urban-rural supply chains. Disrupting those supply chains means disrupting food security. Yet short-term climate shocks and long-term climate change threaten to cause that disruption. This chapter does four things: (1) analyzes the types and determinants of vulnerabilities of food supply chains to climate shocks and change; (2) considers how those vulnerabilities are conditioned by urbanization, diet change, and rapid transformation of food systems; (3) discusses how supply chain actors, from farmers to processors and distributors and input suppliers, invest in mitigation of the risks of these shocks and reduction of their vulnerabilities; (4) discusses policy implications and lays out an agenda for research for climate-smart food supply chains in developing regions.

Although contract price can include a premium (e.g., Brown, 1989; Hubbard and Weiner, 1992), it is not a modeling assumption for deriving the optimal procurement policy. The numerical analyses (refer to Table 1a and Table 1b) in Section 6 illustrates the model's results when the contract price has and does not have a premium over expected market price. Market Price Uncertainty, Risk Aversion and Procurement: Combining Contracts and Open Market Sourcing Alternatives[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We evaluate the implications of concurrent utilization of “contracts” and “open market” arrangements by a risk averse buyer in continuous procuring of a standardized product of known demand over a specified time period. The buyer being risk averse is concerned about the magnitude and uncertainty of expenses. The contract price is deterministic and the market price is stochastic. Cases when the two price processes are exogenous, and when the contract price is endogenously linked to volume of procurement and market price are examined. Models are developed to determine the optimal pattern of procurement from the two arrangements for specified price, risk aversion and contract duration parameters. The study finds that optimal procurement from market increases with contract price premium but decreases with degree of risk aversion and market price uncertainty. Usefulness of alternate forms of contracts when contract and market alternatives are used concurrently is discussed. Application of the models to hypothetical datasets compares the relative usefulness of alternate forms of integrating contract and market alternatives, and of complete reliance on “contract” or “market” alternatives.

Further, it is expected that increase ownership in the hands of managers will lead to greater equity value for shareholders (Hubbard & Palia, 1995). This theory has been shown to be under-specified in explaining equity ownership effects. A TEST OF MODERATED MEDIATION BETWEEN FIRM SIZE AND LEVEL OF VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE IN THAILAND[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Despite intensive efforts to determine the nature of the relationship between the firm size and the level of voluntary disclosure (VDI), empirical studies of this issue have produced mixed results. This paper attempts to delve deeper into this complex phenomenon by employing a resource dependency perspective to hypothesize a model of mediation as board of directors' quality index (BOQI) is moderated by CEO's ownership. The findings suggest that the larger firm size, the higher is the BOQI as a mediating link to the higher is the VDI. In contrast, when further moderated by a high concentration of CEO's ownership on the BOQI, these associations appear to be weaker. Further, board size as control variable is found to have positive significant influence on the BOQI and the VDI. In contrast, board size is found to have negative significant when further moderated by a high concentration of CEO's ownership on the BOQI.

Hubbard and Weiner [12] have estimated an equation for private oil inventory behavior in the United States and discussed public–private interactions in stockpiling. Oren and Wan [13] have proposed a stochastic dynamic programming approach to quantifying the optimal size, fillup and drawdown rates for the SPR of the United States under various assumptions. The effect of an SPR on the oil price in China: A system dynamics approach[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This paper builds a system dynamics model to simulate the effect of China’s strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) on stabilizing the domestic oil price. By setting the sensitivity of the market to the domestic oil price and the increase in international oil price, this paper discusses three different SPR sizes, namely, 30 days, 60 days and 90 days SPR, and analyzes the effects of releasing the three different sizes of SPR on domestic oil price in 2015 at three international oil price scenarios: low, baseline and high. The results show that the suppress effect of SPR release on domestic oil price is not obvious under a low oil price scenario. Only when the increase in the international oil price is greater than 81% in an insensitive domestic market and 94% in a highly sensitive domestic market, 90 days SPR release can suppress the rising domestic oil price. In the baseline scenario, the SPR fails to suppress rising oil prices when the increase in the international oil price is less than 25%. However, in the high international oil price scenario with a notably small fluctuation in the international oil price, the SPR can arrest the rising oil price. In addition, the suppressing effect of SPR is related to the sensitivity of the domestic market to oil price. The greater the sensitivity of the domestic markets to oil price, the weaker the effect of the SPR on suppressing oil price. Finally, the SPR size should reach to 90 day in China.Article · Nov 2014 Jian-Ling JiaoKuang-Yi HanGang Wu+1 more author...Lan-Lan LiReadFollowing the seminal papers by Domowitz et al. (1988) and Bernard and Jensen (1994) and the influential contributions of Bernard et al. (2003) and, it is today uncontroversially recognized that firms are heterogeneous along different dimensions , even within the same sector and geographical market. Despite this evidence, the presence of an encompassing theoretical framework, that incorporates several aspects of heterogeneity, is still lacking Verti-Zontal Differentiation in Monopolistic Competition[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The pattern of trade observed from firm-product-country data calls for a new generation of models. To address the unexplained variation in the data, we propose a new model of monopolistic competition where varieties enter preferences non-symmetrically, capturing both horizontal and vertical differentiation in an unprecedented way. Together with a variable elasticity of substitution, competition effects, varying markups and prices across countries, this results in a tractable model that rationalizes the empirical finding that firm-product quantities show systematically more variability than prices across export destinations. Accounting for unexplained data variation, our model can thus be used to improve demand identification.

The purpose of these restrictions was to limit the growth and activities of commercial banks to fund big pieces of the capital required by the large American firms emerging at the end of the 19th century. The Political Economy of Financialisation in an Age of Growing Inequality[Show description] [Hide description] DESCRIPTION: This article proposes a re-interpretation of the political economy of financialisation in the OECD countries, which have experienced a continuous rise in income inequality. I show that changes in the income distribution may threaten the socio-political foundations of financialisation. First, whereas the continuous increase in income inequality maintain the alliance between financiers, managers and high-skilled workers intact to support the adoption of pro-minority shareholder, all the consecutive changes in financial and labour markets have produced increasing institutional incoherence and labour market dualisation, making the previous alliance more fragile. Second, despite stagnant incomes, middle-class and low-income households are in favour of higher financialisation because easy credit stimulates their consumption level. Encouraging
credit supply contributes to the rise in household debt, thereby increasing workers’ vulnerability.
