Publication number:  20170203022
                                            

Abstract:  A system that fills multiple containers includes a filter with an inlet port and multiple outlet ports. The outlet ports are pre-attached to containers by respective filling lines of each container. Each container has an interior and each of the respective filling lines is connected to a respective container interior. All of the respective filling lines are sealed to the outlet ports and the containers such that the container interiors are isolated from an external environment except the inlet port, via the filter, forming a combined interior volume which is sterile. The system can produce batches of multiple sterile containers with sterile medicament in the containers.

Peritoneal Dialysis Systems, Devices, and Methods



Publication number:  20170203027
                                            

Abstract:  A method of performing a peritoneal dialysis treatment includes connecting a disposable unit to a source of water, the disposable unit including at least a first container holding a sterile concentrate containing an osmotic agent, a second container holding a sterile concentrate containing electrolytes, an empty sterile mixing container, and a tubing set with a pre-attached peritoneal fill/drain line. The method further includes receiving a prescription command by a controller, indicating at least the fill volume and desired final concentration of the osmotic agent to be used for a current fill cycle under said treatment, and using the controller, pumping a quantity of the concentrated osmotic agent that is at least sufficient to achieve the desired final concentration into the mixing container. The contents of the mixing container are mixed, further diluted or concentrated, and then flowed to a patient.

Peritoneal Dialysis Systems, Devices, and Methods



Publication number:  20170203026
                                            

Abstract:  A method of performing a dialysis treatment includes using a pump and a dialysate supply line to transport peritoneal dialysis fluid, the supply line having a proximal end into which peritoneal dialysis fluid is supplied and from which spend dialysate is withdrawn, and a distal end which is connected to a patient's peritoneal access. The method further includes generating proximal and distal pressure signals using pressure detectors located at both the proximal and distal ends, respectively, of said supply line. During a drain cycle in which spent dialysate is pumped from the patient, the method includes, responsively to the proximal and distal pressure signals, detecting a characteristic of a pressure difference between the distal and proximal ends whose magnitude is determined by a predicted change in dialysate properties, and responsively to the characteristic, generating a signal indicating the change in dialysate properties.

Abstract:  Systems, methods, and devices for preparation of water for various uses including blood treatment are described. In embodiments, fluid is passed either by pump or passively by gravity feed, through various filtration elements from a fluid source to a treatment fluid container. The latter forms a batch that may be used during treatment. Methods and systems for creating multiple-treatment batches are described. Advantages of creating a multitreatment batch include the fact that the burden of treatment preparation can be reduced and the timing of the preparation of the batch can be independent of the treatment time. As described, there are various trade-offs and concerns with this approach which are addressed by the inventive embodiments.

METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MACHINE ERROR DETECTION BY COMBINING MULTIPLE SENSOR INPUTS



Publication number:  20160206803
                                            

Abstract:  One of the most significant safety concerns in the automation of extracorporeal blood treatments such as dialysis is the risk of blood leakage. Extracorporeal blood treatment systems draw blood at such a high rate that a loss of integrity in the blood circuit can be serious. There are a number of mechanisms for detecting and preventing leaks, but none is perfect. This tends to limit the use of such equipment in unsupervised settings, such as the home will be limited. Some leak detection schemes can be made sensitive enough to detect the barest of leaks, but when this is done, they result in too many false positives. The invention combines information from multiple inputs to enhance sensitivity in leak detection and reduce the problem of false positives.

Abstract:  The disclosed subject matter includes a structure and method for making a dual-lumen needle from single lumen needles to take advantage of the much higher economies of scale. Variations include two needles joined by a flow junction and one needle and a single cannula joined by a flow junction. In addition disclosed are methods of using a dual-lumen needle in a two needle access for blood treatment is disclosed in which at least venous flow is provided through a dual-lumen needle with arterial flow just sufficient to provide air infiltration detection in the event of withdrawal of the dual-lumen needle.

WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS, DEVICES, AND METHODS FOR FLUID PREPARATION



Publication number:  20150374895
                                            

Abstract:  A water purification component, which may be integrated in a medicament production plant and/or a blood treatment system, removes chloramine and other chlorine compounds and deionizes water. The deionization is selected to be effective for providing product water whose resistivity is sufficiently high to allow chloramine to be detected in the product water if the chloramine removal filtration fails. This allows a chloramine removal filter to be changed based on a predicted exhaustion schedule with the safety of automatic chloramine breakthrough provided.

METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MACHINE ERROR DETECTION BY COMBINING MULTIPLE SENSOR INPUTS



Publication number:  20150196702
                                            

Abstract:  One of the most significant safety concerns in the automation of extracorporeal blood treatments such as dialysis is the risk of blood leakage. Extracorporeal blood treatment systems draw blood at such a high rate that a loss of integrity in the blood circuit can be serious. There are a number of mechanisms for detecting and preventing leaks, but none is perfect. This tends to limit the use of such equipment in unsupervised settings, such as the home will be limited. Some leak detection schemes can be made sensitive enough to detect the barest of leaks, but when this is done, they result in too many false positives. The invention combines information from multiple inputs to enhance sensitivity in leak detection and reduce the problem of false positives.
