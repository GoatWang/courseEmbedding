Tiff’s Treats Holdings Inc., a local cookie maker, reported raising $5.7 million of a planned $8.2 million financing.
The Austin company collected the capital from 28 investors, according to a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company dates back to 1999 when Leon Chen and friend Tiffany Taylor started a cookie delivery service at the University of Texas. In 2003, they opened their first store at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Nueces Street, which continues to be their headquarters. In the meantime the business partners have gotten married.
Tiff’s Treats operates 15 stores in Austin, Dallas and Houston, including five in the Austin area.




Last month, Tiff’s Treats disclosed plans to open its first cookie bakery and delivery shop in Fort Worth and followed by another store in San Antonio.
In 2014, Austin Business Journal named Tiff’s Treats’ top executive, Leon Chen, as CEO of the year in the small company category.
