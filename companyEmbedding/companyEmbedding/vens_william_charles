Natural with a JOB: Venus Williams





When you read that title, you must spell it out - J - O - B! Does it ever feel to you that the only 'celebrity' naturals you see are always either models, actors or singers? It sort of feeds the mentality that natural hair is only acceptable for some. Well here to bust that myth wide open is Venus Williams - 5 time Wimbledon Champ.

TV was never big in my house but tennis was something that everyone loved (anyone remember Zina Garrison?). I grew up on a steady diet of Venus Williams as a hard working, super aggressive and hard hitting tennis player. Her work ethic is admirable as is the fact that she has interests outside of tennis.

She also happens to be natural! Here she is in a recent ESPN interview, still living her life by her own rules and still so funny! If you want insight into her world and want to see her natural hair, here it is! 








In the event it was not clear by the obvious gushing, yes this is a Venus Williams fan zone. Thanks to @jaimuziq for showing me this video! :)

Venus Williams’ Mom On Crash: ‘She Just Has to Live With It’ 
Venus Williams’ Mom On Crash: ‘She Just Has to Live With It’


EXCLUSIVE
Venus Williams‘ mother says the tennis superstar is still reeling from the car crash that left 1 man dead — but says she’s able to cope because she’s a very strong person.
Oracene Price tells TMZ Sports … Venus is “very much” upset and affected by the June 9 crash in Palm Beach Gardens, FL — but her family, including Serena, is rallying around her.
When asked what advice she’s given Venus on how to deal with the situation, Price says: “It’s something that you kinda have to do internally yourself but you’ll never forget it. But it’ll always be there so you just have to live with it.”
As we previously reported, Venus’ car was T-boned by another vehicle in an intersection, killing a 78-year-old man. Venus has not been charged with a crime (and likely won’t be) but cops are still investigating.
The victim’s family has filed a civil suit against Venus — but Oracene says her daughter isn’t worried about it.
As for Serena, Oracene says she’s SUPER excited about the pregnancy and can’t wait to be a grandmother.
But don’t expect the baby to keep Serena off the court too long — Oracene says Serena is planning to return to pro tennis ASAP because “she likes to compete.”
 
 Venus Williams’ mother says the tennis superstar is still reeling from the car crash that left 1 man dead — but says she’s able to cope because she’s a very strong person. Oracene Price tells TMZ Sports … Venus is “very much” upset and affected…
