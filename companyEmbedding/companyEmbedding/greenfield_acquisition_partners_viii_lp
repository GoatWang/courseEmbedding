 formed Greenfield Partners in 1997, determined, from the outset, to lead an organization that excelled in real estate investment management. I believed  that the entrepreneurial energy of a start-up needn't be stifled as it matures. On the contrary, I felt, with the right group of skilled, committed professionals, we could surprise people with our ability to both create and sustain as we grew.

My primary objectives were straightforward. First was to build a strong team with unparalleled dedication to their work and to each other. Second was to operate with a proactive, flexible outlook, anticipating changes in the investment environment. Notwithstanding inevitable periods of market turmoil, we have achieved this and more, as our staying power and stature in the industry attests. We are a unified group of talented individuals, joined together by a deep commitment to creating special places to live, work, and play. 

Now, well into our second decade, I am proud of the way we have applied our principles to improve the investment process, and even more gratified, that we did it as a team.

In the end, it's about having disciplined people implementing innovative strategies in a principled way â people implicitly trusted by their investment partners to protect their interests, and maximize the value of their holdings, regardless of shifting financial conditions.

To help establish a ballpark figure for the number of financial funds with dedicated capital to acquire hotels, Hotel News Now has started compiling the Hotel News Now Hotel Acquisition Funds List. Please bookmark this page and return often for updates. The latest update was completed 2 December 2013. 

We’ve confirmed as many as possible, and we know this list is incomplete. We’re hoping our readers can help fill in the blanks. If you know of funds missing from this list, please drop Finance Editor Shawn A. Turner a line at shawn@hotelnewsnow.com with some of the details. We’ll keep your tip anonymous, and we’ll do everything we can to confirm the funds with the sponsoring fund and/or company. Highlighted funds are recent additions to the list.
