Product Details



Garments for Good: Founded in 1977, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust rescues and protects orphaned elephants and rhinos in East Africa from ivory poaching and extinction. To date, they've successfully rescued, hand raised and rehabilitated 190 elephant orphans before reintegrating them into the wild. In their honor, we teamed up with London-based illustrator Marcel George to create this limited-edition T-shirt. Fifty percent of the retail price from the sale of this T-shirt will be donated to the Trust. Learn more about the elephants. .

How J.Crew Can Weather the Rough Seas

    World Class Faculty & Research

SMITH BRAIN TRUST – J.Crew is battling some choppy seas.
It's had 10 consecutive quarterly sales declines, two straight years of losses, and now the iconic, classic clothier is swimming in more than $2 billion in debt.
Its longtime style maven and creative director Jenna Lyons is out, after 26 years of helping to define American preppy chic, as is the company's once-celebrated chief executive Mickey Drexler. It's paddling against unprecedented challenges from fast-fashion retailers and e-commerce competitors.
And now as J.Crew looks to right its course, it's facing another crisis: an identity crisis. 
"People are confused now about who is the target consumer for J.Crew," says Yajin Wang, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
J.Crew's fashions used to be aimed at young professionals in search of "less-boring office attire" and natty weekend apparel, says Wang.
"But it started to reach out to younger, teenage consumers, and older consumers started to wear J.Crew as well, and that started to dilute the brand image," she says. Gradually, the products began to span an ever-widening range of price points as well.
Take any kind of "Branding 101" or marketing strategy course, Wang says, and it will tell you that in retail, a consumer target that's too broad is like having no target at all.
"You have to find your niche, your point of differentiation," Wang says.
The American stylebook
"J.Crew for a long time was an iconic brand, an aspirational brand," says Jie Zhang, professor of marketing and the Harvey Sanders Fellow of Retail Management at the Smith School.
It debuted in 1983 with the mailing of its first catalog, surged to prominence in the 1990s and stayed there.
"J.Crew was really writing the American stylebook," says Zhang. "They were saying essentially: ‘If you are an upper- or middle-income white-collar professional, this is what you should wear.' "
"Consumers don't shop that way anymore," Zhang adds. They shop around, are less brand loyal, and prefer to pick and choose looks across a tableau of labels. 
"This idea of one brand, one fashion retailer that will tell you what you should wear, that idea is gone," she says. That's been hard for J.Crew and total-look peers like it: Banana Republic, Tommy Hilfiger, Ann Taylor.
There were other problems as well. "Over the years it became overpriced and had under-delivered on style," Zhang says. "And that's a huge problem."
Online, J.Crew's prices and their bored-looking (or drunk-looking) catalog models were ruthlessly mocked.
‘Tsunami for the fashion industry'
With Lyons at the creative helm, J.Crew began churning out more fashion-forward pieces in recent years, tuxedo pants with leather trim, sequined skirts and boldly beaded blouses. But younger consumers were increasingly lured to cheaper, fast-fashion rivals for on-trend pieces and, eventually, were also turning to them for J.Crew-ish retro preppy looks.
"Fast fashion has created a tsunami for the fashion industry," says Zhang.
J.Crew, like many of its peers, began building more and more factory outlet stores, seeking to appeal to the price-conscious shopper, with faster, cheaper versions of its mainstay fashions, with limited success.
J.Crew can't reasonably compete, Zhang and Wang both say, with the likes H&M and Zara, whose turnaround from design concept to production to sales floor is just seven days.
Online sales posed another challenge, and J.Crew didn't keep up. 
Leaving the CEO post, Drexler, who will stay on as chairman, acknowledged his own failures, including sluggish adaptation to e-commerce. To his point: J.Crew remains slow to realize that shoppers don't like paying for shipping.
Value of the sub-brand
J.Crew is regrouping now under new CEO James Brett, formerly president of the West Elm home furnishing chain. It's facing the need to restructure its large debt load and a need to redefine its place in fashion.
Zhang and Wang say J.Crew should begin by reinventing its clothing lines and defining sub-brands that offer homes for different types of customers – touting J.Crew Collection as the hub for fashion-forward elite clientele, the original J.Crew for its core aspirational shopper, and Factory J.Crew for its price-conscious and teenage fans.
Wang says each line needs its own distinct clothing designs and labels, "fully establishing" three unique sub-brands.
Zhang recommends that J.Crew focus its core brand on its original target consumer – the more-established, affluent professional who can afford premium, slower-fashion pricing.
With the rise of coworking spaces and the growing influence of a startup culture that shuns the buttoned-up business attire of old, Zhang says, there's demand for well-made work essentials with a casual sensibility. That's a niche that J.Crew is well positioned to fill, she says.
"Even though office wear is becoming more casual, people want to get that vibe right, that nuance in fashion," Zhang says.
J.Crew Collection, which is sold online and in limited quantities in the mainline stores, boasts couture-quality fashions and couture-type prices. It appeals to a more well-heeled customer, but J.Crew does little to set it apart from its everyday fashions. And that's a marketing goof.
Dresses from J.Crew Collection often carry price tags of $350 or more; skirts can sell for $700; blouses for $500.
"The people spending $600 on a dress don't want to be thinking that the teenagers are wearing the same brand, but spending $10 on a Tshirt," Wang says. "There has to be a way to differentiate."
Going big on outlet-mall locations and constant sales promotions, Wang says, "was great to get consumers in to buy your stuff in the short term." But in the long run, chintzier fabrics, lower price points and less-quality construction threatened to alienate those who prize the brand's more-luxury ethos.
Coach leather goods took a similar route, expanding its customer base with factory outlet stores and less-expensive handbag options, but ultimately diluting its brand appeal. Wang says she uses Coach as a case study for her students. It's a cautionary tale for J.Crew.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
