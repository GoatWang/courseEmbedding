Strategy — Blum Capital























































































































































 Strategy Blum Capital has consistently pursued its corporate investing strategy since the firm’s INCEPTION in 1975.For over forty years, we have applied our investment strategy focusing on small- and mid-capitalization companies to source strategic block and control investments and subsequently work with the managements and boards of directors to increase shareholder value.  Over time, we have invested more than $10 billion of equity capital and demonstrated a proven ability to play a constructive, active role in unlocking value from our portfolio companies through the implementation of financial, operational, and governance initiatives.The core tenets of our investment strategy have remained constant throughout the firm’s history while still allowing us to take advantage of different opportunities in diverse market environments.  This flexibility has resulted in portfolios that have varied in emphasis over time.  However, the key principles of our investment philosophy have always been consistently applied as follows:  




High Quality of BusinessWe believe in the importance of investing in high quality businesses with defensible franchises, attractive long-term growth potential and attractive returns on invested capital because high quality businesses generate greater compounding of wealth over time.Opportunity for Value-addOur goal is to be the largest or among the largest shareholders and to build a partnership with management and the board of directors allowing us to initiate and often  implement value-added strategies that enhance shareholder returns.  Our proposals include a broad range of financial, operational, and governance initiatives with the objective of maximizing equity value over time.Small/Mid-cap FocusOur primary focus is the small- and mid-capitalization sectors of the market, which we believe tend to offer more attractively valued investment opportunities.  In addition, smaller and mid-sized companies afford greater potential for influence and value-add on our part than larger companies.Long-term HorizonWe are long-term investors.  Our long-term perspective allows us to take a partnership approach with management teams whose time horizons are similar to our own.  The average holding period for private equity investments made by our Strategic Funds has been five years.Concentrated PortfolioOur strategy is to limit investments to a relatively small number of our best opportunities and to focus our efforts on adding value to those portfolio companies.  Combined with our highly selective investment criteria, intensive research and ability to implement value-creating initiatives, we believe concentration is critical in achieving our goal of superior returns. Rigorous Research ProcessConsistent with our private equity approach, we apply a highly rigorous process in researching potential investments.  We believe our concentrated portfolio strategy requires this level of private equity due diligence in order to minimize investment risk.

About Blum
   Blum manufactures functional kitchen cabinet hardware of the highest quality under the philosophy, "We don't make kitchens; we make kitchens work easier." Since 1977 Blum has been creating innovative functional kitchen cabinet hardware unlike any other company. It got its start in a small warehouse in Hickory, North Carolina and quickly outgrew the establishment. Today the company operates out of a 450,000 square foot building and employs almost 400 people. Once you have experienced the quality craftsmanship of Blum hardware you will understand how the company has grown so rapidly. Browse PullsDirect.com to become familiar with the extraordinary offerings from Blum.  Blum BLUMOTION is a favorite among kitchen owners all over the world and is available in several of its products. BLUMOTION is a technology that allows for the smooth and silent closing of a cabinet door or drawer on every repetition. BLUMOTION is available as an integrated featured on select Blum hinges. The functionality is built into the internal mechanism so it operates out of sight. It is also available as a clip on device to add BLUMOTION to your existing cabinet hinges. The technology adapts to different situations, resulting in a consistent soft close, regardless of weight or closing force. Once you experience the freedom from banging cabinet doors, you will never stray from BLUMOTION by Blum. Blum hinges are designed to satisfy the needs of today's kitchen. They are extremely functional, quiet, and long-lasting. This is what makes thousands of consumers and cabinet makers choose hinges by Blum every day. Another thing you'll want to consider when selecting a cabinet hinge is a good opening angle. The most common Blum hinge angles are 110 and 120 degrees. Blum 110 hinges allow you to view all of the contents in your cabinets without having the door in your way. Blum also offers the ultimate in opening angles, offering a 170 degree angle. This may be necessary in certain applications but in most instances the 110 hinge will suffice. All of Blum's cabinet hinges have a concealed design, meaning they are hidden from view when the cabinet is door is closed. Concealed hinges work well on any application, but are especially beneficial for cabinets with face frame construction. Within this lineup of concealed hinges, Blum has several styles to choose from. The most popular is the compact 33 hinge. The 33.3600 is a prime example of a compact hinge that offers every feature in a condensed package. It features a 110 degree opening angle, is face or edge mount, and is height and side adjustable.  Drawer slides by Blum feature many of the same innovative technologies as its cabinet hinges. Often referred to as drawer runners, these products work well with any type of drawer. Blum TANDEM is the premier concealed slide for wooded drawers. TANDEM offers a wide range of drawer lengths and works well with drawer material ranging in widths from ½" to ¾". Weight capacities are available up to 110 pounds to accommodate drawers with the heaviest of objects. TANDEMBOX is a complete drawer system that can be used to build a new drawer. Both of these styles feature BLUMOTION to make them a desirable addition to any kitchen, bathroom, or office. The METABOX collection is also used to construct a drawer. The METABOX system doubles as the sides of the drawer as well as the slides, making construction very simple. No joinery, glue, or clamping is required for attachment of the bottom or back of the drawer. The bottom of the drawer rests on the pins of the METABOX system and the back is screwed on. The drawer is completed by screwing the included brackets onto the drawer's front, and then clipping them onto the METABOX slides/sides. This fast, easy, and accurate system is ideal for both new construction and updating existing cabinetry. Designed to perfect the motion of lift systems for wall cabinets, Blum recently launched the AVENTOS collection. This innovative line is focused on perfecting motion and design while keeping the installation process simple. Within the Blum AVENTOS collection are sub-categories to accommodate each type of wall cabinet. Blum offers bi-fold, up-and-over, lift-up, or stay-lift, to ensure the proper lift system for your application. Once you have experienced the convenience and fluid motion of Blum hardware you will not want to revert to standard hardware. With the quality materials and expert craftsmanship that goes into Blum products, you are sure to have a piece of hardware that will last a lifetime. Bring Blum into your home or office by searching our selection at PullsDirect.com today.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, PullsDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require PullsDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at PullsDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					PullsDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. PullsDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
