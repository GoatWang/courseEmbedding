			Lambertus J.H. Becht joined the Board as Chairman in November 2011 and became Coty's interim CEO in September 2014. He also serves as the Chairman of the board of directors of Jacobs Douwe Egberts B.V. and Chairman of the board of directors of the parent of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., as well as a non-executive director of Peet's Coffee & Tea, Inc. and the Caribou Coffee Company, Inc./Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Inc. Mr. Becht is also a partner and Chairman of the JAB Group. From 1999 to August 2011, Mr. Becht was Chief Executive Officer of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a leading global consumer goods company in the field of household cleaning and health and personal care. Prior to that, Mr. Becht was Chief Executive Officer of privately held Benckiser Detergents, which in 1997 became Benckiser N.V. and listed on the Amsterdam and New York Stock Exchanges, and in 1999 merged with Reckitt & Colman plc and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Before becoming Chief Executive Officer of Benckiser Detergents in 1995, Mr. Becht held a variety of marketing, sales and finance positions at P&G in the United States and Germany and served within Benckiser Detergents as General Manager in Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Mr. Becht holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.
We believe Mr. Becht is well qualified to serve as Chairman of our Board. Mr. Becht has many years of experience in the consumer products industry, including executive, operating, marketing, finance and international business experience, and was Chief Executive Officer of Reckitt Benckiser. We believe these experiences are advantageous to us and are critical to his ability to identify, understand and address challenges and opportunities that we face. 
Mr. Becht will step down as Coty's interim CEO effective as of the day following the closing of the Transactions, but will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
