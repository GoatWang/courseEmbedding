The Midtown Financial Group
Director of Business & Estate Planning
 
Financial success is not something that can be achieved through mere chance.  The success you aspire for takes acumen, hard work, discipline and strategic financial planning.  Each decision you make and action you take will have a significant impact on your future financial circumstances.  A good financial blueprint will lay out what you need to do today, in order to achieve your goals tomorrow.
As your Wealth Management Advisor, I will observe and help facilitate your goals and aspirations before developing a personalized financial plan designed to help you achieve your vision for the future.
If I were to assist you in my capacity as a fee-based advisor, you can be assured of receiving unbiased, in-depth analysis of your situation.  In other words, for a fee you could receive essential guidance with no expectation that the plan will be implemented with us.  
My compensation is derived from the time and expertise I put into tailoring a personal financial plan that is suited specifically for you.  More importantly, I feel that this role dictates that I have a responsibility to ensure your interests and goals are always the prime concern.
In the end, my predominant motivation during our arrangement will be to make sure your financial needs are met with care, with proficiency and with an understanding of your unique circumstances and individual goals. Together, we can agree on the appropriate fee structure based upon those needs and the specific services required.
