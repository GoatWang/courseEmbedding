Wouldn’t you like to consolidate legacy hierarchical architectures based on north/south design with oversubscription bottlenecks into a flat, east/west architecture to increase data throughput and reduce latency with only a single hop within large domains of virtual machines or Synergy Compute Modules?

The HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module for HPE Synergy, master module, based on composable fabric is designed for Composable Infrastructure. Its disaggregated, rack-scale design uses a master/satellite architecture to consolidate data center network connections, reduce hardware and scale network bandwidth across multiple HPE Synergy Frames. 

The master module contains intelligent networking capabilities that extends connectivity to satellite frames through Interconnect Link Modules. This decreases top of rack switch needs and substantially reduces costs. The components reduction simplifies fabric management at scale while consuming fewer ports at the data center aggregation layer.

Features

Improve Fabric Efficiency, Reliability and Manageability with HPE Composable Infrastructure
The HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module for Synergy consolidates data center network connections, and reduces hardware and scale network bandwidth across multiple frames with the HPE Synergy innovative disaggregated, rack-scale design.
Efficiently extend flexible pools of network resources from each HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module for Synergy to scale bandwidth across multiple frames.
Improve network reliability with resilient fabric connectivity to upstream switches using Hewlett Packard Enterprise Synergy Multi-module LAG (MLAG) technology.
Enjoy simple, reliable and fast provisioning Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Modules using the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Synergy software-defined intelligence with template-driven programming
Orchestrate frictionless Virtual Connect SE firmware updates in concert with an entire Synergy infrastructure using one-tool, one-step template-based operations from HPE Synergy Composer.
Based on Industry's Proven Virtual Connect Technology
The HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module for Synergy provides one flexible interconnect interface to the network. One device supports common data center networks protocols like; Ethernet, Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and iSCSI.
Fine-tune the performance of each data and storage connection to meet the needs of each of your virtual machines and targeted workloads.
Optimize the hypervisor I/O requirements with Flex-10 and Flex-20 adapters. With two modules you can provide six FlexNICs and two FlexHBAs connections to each Synergy Compute Modules, delivering a best practice network configuration for most hypervisors.
Connect to Synergy Compute Modules using full hardware offload of iSCSI and FCoE protocol processing and minimizing the impact on host CPU performance to increase storage connection performance.
Perform ultra-fast communication between virtual server hosts during migrations and recoveries with hardware based 10/20GbE performance.
Upgrade Your Network with Investment Protection and No Process Changes
The HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module for Synergy is compatible with current networks. Providing seamless connection to existing industry standard data and storage networks avoids replacing each piece of equipment.
One HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module meets data and storage connection needs with multi-protocol support for Ethernet, Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Accelerated iSCSI connections.
Maintain current IT processes with direct uplink connections to LANs and SANs to maintain your current IT practices, unlike other solutions that reroute SAN traffic to the LAN.

Overview

What if you could connect HPE Synergy master and satellite interconnect modules with the flexibility to use either copper or optical cables?

The HPE Synergy Interconnect Link Cable is designed for the HPE Synergy composable fabric which connects pools of compute resources. It links multiple frames through connecting the master module to the satellite module.

It gives you the flexibility to choose either direct attached copper cable (DAC) or active optical cable (AOC) with different length.

Features

Facilitates Reduction of Fixed Ratios of Interconnects to Decrease Cost and Complexity
The HPE Synergy Interconnect Link Cable is specially designed for HPE Synergy Composable Infrastructure. These cables enable the HPE composable fabric to extend connectivity from a master frame to satellite frames.
The master/satellite architecture enabled by HPE Synergy Interconnect Link Cable offers better ROI due to consolidation and aggregation of all traffic, reducing the number of interconnect and corresponding cables/options.
Both AOC and DAC Options for Connecting HPE Synergy Master Modules to Satellite Modules
The HPE Synergy Interconnect Link Cable provides 120 Gb connection for HPE master satellite architecture.
The AOC cables deliver low weight, small bend radius, lower power consumption and ease of installation and can be used up to 15m.
The DAC cables provide low-cost solution for short distance connectivity up to 2.1m.

Synergy invests in Africa Terminals 




                  	By Staff Writer | Africa Global Funds					February 24, 2016







Synergy Capital Managers has invested in Africa Terminals, a spin off from DuPort Marine, a trading logistics and maritime company with over eight years’ experience operating in the Nigerian downstream segment.
Africa Terminals as the first independently owned regional Terminal and Storage Company will offer storage capacity to both local and international multi-country petroleum products trading companies across West Africa.
Africa Terminals is seeking to leverage its experience and understanding of the oil & gas value chain in West Africa to secure a leading competitive position in the largely under-served storage segment.
This investment by Synergy will enable the company acquire and develop storage terminals for petroleum products (DPK, AGO, PMS, JET A1 and LPG) in strategic locations across the West African coast including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia and Senegal.
Tosin Odusanya, Promoter and CEO of Africa Terminals, said: “Africa Terminals as a pure play storage company is an attractive choice for trading companies in the region and this enhances the forward prospects for Africa Terminals. The company already has confirmed off-take agreements for 60% of its storage capacity per development/acquisition from four international and local operators.”
“We are delighted and also excited to partner with Synergy Capital to roll out the first multi-country petroleum products and gas Storage Company across West Africa. The existing storage capacity shortage will only exacerbate with the on-going deregulation of the industry across the region, as these efforts will result in the revitalization of existing refineries even as new refineries are developed to take advantage of changing regulations. All of these will further boost the demand for storage, as more products are made available in markets across the region,” he added.
The investment in Africa Terminals is the fifth investment of Synergy Private Equity Fund LP (SPEF) since its first close in September 2014. SPEF is focused on making investments in select high growth sectors in Nigeria and Ghana, and the mid stream segment of the oil & gas industry in West Africa is a target sector of the fund. Synergy is seeking to work with Africa Terminals to roll-out the first independently built storage terminal business across West Africa over the medium term.
Ayodele Arogbo, Partner at Synergy Capital Managers, said: “The CEO’s antecedent in building a strong and profitable business in this sector gives us confidence. We are assured that he and his team coupled with the Manager’s track record possess the requisite experience and capabilities to seamlessly execute the plan for Africa Terminals.”
SPEF remains active in sourcing and completing deals in its target sectors both in Nigeria and Ghana. “We are on track to meet our portfolio allotment for 2016 with planned investments in media/entertainment, financial services and manufacturing in the course of the year,” said Arogbo.
