Seattle investor buys Lydig Construction’s Valley campus
Contractor signs 10-year land, building leaseback
Mike McLean
May 11th, 2017















	Two real estate holding companies affiliated with prominent Spokane Valley-based general contractor Lydig Construction Inc. have sold the Lydig campus to a Seattle real estate investment company.

	As part of the transaction, Lydig has entered into a 10-year lease with the buyer, BearRock Investment VI, says Larry Swartz, Lydig CEO.

	The two adjacent parcels at 11001 E. Montgomery and 10924 E. Marietta include a total of 5.5 acres of land occupied by a 21,000-square-foot office building, a 10,000-square-foot warehouse, and a 5,500-square-foot service garage, which make up the campus Lydig has occupied as its headquarters since 1999.

	BearRock acquired the property for a total of $5.8 million from New Millennium Land Development LLC, and New Millennium Land Development II LLC, state tax records show.

	Swartz and Mark Bray, Lydig’s chief financial officer, are the managing members of New Millennium Land Development, and Swartz is the managing member of New Millennium Land Development II.

	Swartz says the decision to sell is related to long-term succession planning for Lydig and the strength of the current real estate market.

	Lydig, which was founded here in 1956, currently has 150 employees, 90 of whom are based in Spokane Valley. The company also has offices in Bellevue and Kennewick.

	Lydig manages and constructs large projects, including medical, retail, educational, detention, government, office, hospitality, industrial, and distribution facilities. The contractor also handles smaller projects, including historic renovations, tenant improvements, and capital improvements.

	Swartz earlier told the Journal that the company is projecting it will have $300 million worth of work this year.

	Commercial real estate broker Mike Livingston, of Spokane-based Kiemle & Hagood Co., represented the sellers in the transaction.

	 

Manufacturing & Industrial

509 Fabrications Inc., a new maker of fuel-log burning stoves, has leased 7,100 square feet of office and manufacturing space at 6512 W. Seltice Way, in Post Falls. Craig Hunter and Rob Kannapien, both of Coldwell Banker Commercial Schneidmiller Realty, and Sam Morse, of Cantu Commercial Properties LLC, handled the transaction.

North Point Land Co., the real estate holding affiliate of North Idaho cabinet maker Advanced Custom Cabinets Inc., has leased a 25,700-square-foot warehouse building at 250 W. Anton, in Coeur d’Alene, and plans to move there from smaller quarters at 9896 N. Chelsea Court, in Hayden. Craig Hunter and Rob Kannapien, both of Coldwell Banker Commercial Schneidmiller Realty, handled the transaction.

Williams Automotive has leased a 2,610-square-foot industrial building at 3711 E. Nebraska and has moved the service and repair shop there from smaller quarters at 1923 N. Hamilton. Jim Orcutt, of NAI Black, handled the transaction.

	 

Office

Parsons Construction Inc., a Spokane general contractor and custom homebuilder, has bought a 4,700-square-foot building and 1.2 acres of land at 7721 E. Trent, where the company plans to expand by moving its office operations from its present location on an adjacent parcel at 7703 E. Trent. The company also plans to construct a new façade for the structure and lease out two portions of it. Matthew Byrd, of SVN Cornerstone, and Jim Orcutt, of NAI Black, brokered the transaction.

Coeur d’Alene Moving Inc. has leased 700 square feet of space at 3655 N. Government Way, in Coeur d’Alene, where it plans to move its office from a home base. Craig Hunter and Rob Kannapien, both of Coldwell Banker Commercial Schneidmiller Realty, handled the transaction.

Jonathan and Lycia Clark, of Spokane, have bought as an investment an 1,800-square-foot shop building at 7002 N. Market. Dallas Lightner and Ryan Towner, both of NAI Black, and Marshall Clark, of Clark Pacific Real Estate Co., handled the transaction.

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 3/31/17. Based on 815 ETFs and $1.42 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).
