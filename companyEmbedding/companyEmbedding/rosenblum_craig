    This doctor was fine until he had to fill out my paperwork sent from my employer.  Then he throws it down and says  when asked "I'm not filling that out" . Can you believe that ! Also when talking...
    






  
  
            <p>Dr. Craig Rosenblum is an anesthesiologist and pain management specialist. It can prescribe painkillers for those suffering amounts of pain that cannot be controlled with over-the-counter drugs.

Agiloft Service Desk Suite Review By Craig Rosenblum, Sales and Marketing | IT Central Station







Sign InHelp Desk Software » Agiloft Service Desk Suite » ReviewAgiloft Service Desk Suite ReviewIt's customizable, can be developed easily, and free, but only up to a certain number of users. 860LinkedInTweet ItImprovements to My Organization:

This product has provided us with a tool to perform a successful trial with our customer and receive their stamp of approval to move beyond the trial phase. Because this product is infinitely customizable and easily developed, we are using it for other applications.

Use of Solution:

60 days

Deployment Issues:

None

Stability Issues:

This is actually interesting. Their model is that the software is basically free, to a point based on number of users. We developed a functioning product and it ran on their test server without a hiccup. 

Scalability Issues:

For our application, the product has scaled perfectly.

Customer Service:

Excellent. They provide free support for 30 days for free software!  Seriously.

Technical Support:

Excellent

Previous Solutions:

We tried (and paid for) the Interneer (Intellect) BPM solution. We experienced too many problems which challenged our confidence in the product to move forward. Even after we paid for it, we felt that we would be better off abandoning the Intellect product and going with another solution. 

Implementation Team:

We developed it ourselves in-house. In 2 weeks, we had a usable solution. 

Cost and Licensing Advice:

This is a great question because this is an area of diversity. Due to the nature of BPM, the workflow and processes will change and improve over time which will require modifications to the software. For this reason, it makes sense to be able to do it in-house. I would recommend that you try either the Agiloft product or the BonitaSoft product because you can develop them without a fee to a point to see if it is right for you. The product that we paid for upfront, the Interneer (Intellect) solution, doesn't seem to have the same capabilities or latest technology look and feel as the free version.

Other Solutions Considered:

Intellect, BonitaSoft

Craig Rosenblum

Optimos International, LLCCraig Rosenblum 

























Craig Rosenblum is Optimos International’s head of Sales and Marketing. His primary responsibility on a global basis includes Company’s branding and leading the Sales and Marketing strategies, implementation and execution.
After finding success in sales in his hometown, Detroit Michigan, Craig ventured to Boca Raton, Florida where he took a floundering branch office for a distributor of connectivity products and turned it into the #1 location in the company maintaining a controlling market presence in the southeast US and Caribbean. Created and launched a product line of sound products, AccuSound as part of a foray into the Home Theater market. Following a promotion to Vice President in 1996, he opened a branch in North Carolina solely focused at the Telecom Market. This location would quickly exceed revenue expectations culminating in the creation of a product line developed for the Central Office with one product generating an estimated annual revenue of $60MM and becoming integral to numerous CLEC’s networks. A series of promotions would follow, Director of Operations, V.P. of Sales and then Executive Manager of Sales & Operations for the Southeast after the company was acquired giving him full responsibility for a $120MM territory.  Under his direction, the territories profitability would exceed projections and the company would adopt a number of his forecasting and growth methodologies companywide.
Relocating to his current home, Atlanta Georgia, as Director of Sales of a cable fabrication company, he would lead them for 7 years thru the recession and emerge a leader in their market.
Craig’s next challenge was to create a sales team for a Network Deployment division at a $1B, 35 year old company. After 4 years, division sales had increased 60%. In 2011, he joined Optimos International and hasn’t looked back sustained by Family, friends and food.
