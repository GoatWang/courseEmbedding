“With the new scheduler and EHR, we get a lot of the information up front, so when the patient comes in, unless they have something changed insurance-wise they’re already verified and ready to be taken back right away, it also makes it much easier for billing.”
Nancy Sutter
Office manager






 



“[Our] patients are very well-educated and well-informed, and they want to see results quickly. The practice has to run extremely efficiently and be accessible to them. The nice thing about [AdvancedMD] is it has allowed me to be more efficient both in and out of the office. Now I don’t have to come back into the office, which is great for my family and everything else. It saves me a lot of time – probably an hour a day on the three days I work in the second office.”

TechPath is our distinctive learning approach that grew out of the understanding that students need a different kind of education to prepare them for a world that’s tech-intense, constantly changing and connected as never before through the digital mesh – an ever-expanding dynamic interaction of smart machines, information, applications and human beings.

P2D2 is a key component of what makes TechPath a smart, new way of getting the knowledge you need to be ready to hit the ground running in the new way successful companies work today.
We’re proud to offer our TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1. TechPath degree programs are noted below
1TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017.

Get started in a tech-infused undergraduate certificate or bachelor’s degree program and earn a credential employers recognize.



    Take the TechPath
  


TechPath is our distinctive learning approach that grew out of the understanding that students need a different kind of education to prepare them for a world that’s tech-intense, constantly changing and connected as never before through the digital mesh – an ever-expanding dynamic interaction of smart machines, information, applications and human beings.
Every TechPath class you take, whether it’s in a business, health or tech program, revolves around a unique learning rubric developed at DeVry. We call it People-Process-Data-Devices or P2D2. You’ll gain real skills in collaboration, be able to adapt to new structures, create innovative ways of working, and be comfortable working with data and using a wide spectrum of tech-forward tools.
P2D2 is a key component of what makes TechPath a smart, new way of getting the knowledge you need to be ready to hit the ground running in the new way successful companies work today.
We’re proud to offer our TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1. TechPath degree programs are noted below
1TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017.

It’s a tech-forward, career-focused education created to bring distinct value to our students and help our graduates stand out in the modern, dynamic workplace.
We believe our students can, and should, be part of the solution to the tech skills gap faced by so many of today’s employers. Because the skills and understanding that TechPath facilitates can help distinguish DeVry University and our graduates, we’ve decided to offer our TechPath associate and bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1.
1 TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017. New TechPath pricing savings do not apply to certificate programs.





        TechPath Savings






      Tuition Rate Eligibility

To be eligible for the TechPath tuition rate, you must be enrolled in a TechPath program at DeVry University.  TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609.  20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017.  New TechPath pricing savings do not apply to certificate programs. 
The TechPath tuition rate of $487 per credit hour will be charged for the following programs:Medical Billing & Coding Certificate 
        Website Design Certificate2
Website Development Certificate2
Associate in Electronics and Computer Technology 
Associate in Health Information Technology 
Associate in Network Systems Administration 
Bachelor’s in Accounting (online)

Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering Technology  
Bachelor’s in Healthcare Administration

The $609 credit hour rate will be charged for the following non-TechPath programs:Bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering Technology 
Bachelor’s in Business Administration 
Bachelor’s in Communication 
Bachelor’s in Justice Administration 

If you have a corporate partner group tuition rate, check with your education benefits coordinator for more details on how you may take advantage of the TechPath rate and your partner tuition savings benefits.
For current or continuing students3, fees and tuition rates will not change. Current and continuing students will maintain their scholarship and grant awards as well as the Fixed Tuition Promise if they maintain their eligibility for those awards. To review your option for TechPath tuition, contact your Student Support Advisor and set up a financial plan review no later than August 25, 2017 to compare the costs associated with your current pricing versus the TechPath tuition rate. To review your option for TechPath tuition for the July 2017 session, the deadline is June 30, 2017.  If a TechPath current or continuing student, or a non-TechPath current or continuing student wants to transfer to a TechPath Program, they may opt in to the TechPath rate.  By opting in, the current or continuing student’s Fixed Tuition Promise and Scholarship eligibility will expire, and they will not be eligible for the Opportunity Grant. Additionally, the student must sign a new Enrollment Agreement and a Student Service Fee of $25 per session and a one-time $400 LMS Access Fee will be charged. 
2 The complimentary course offered in the third semester for Web Design and Web Development Certificate programs will no longer be offered for new students effective August 2017 session and forward.
3 Check with a Student Support Advisor to determine if you are a current/continuing student.

 EARN A TECH-INFUSED BUSINESS, TECH OR HEALTH DEGREE





FROM A UNIVERSITY WITH INNOVATION AT ITS CORE












 























  

    INNOVATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
  


Technology is at our core here at DeVry University. Because it’s at the core of business, healthcare and tech, everywhere. Our students dig deeper into understanding technology’s role in all things…so they can be ready for whatever comes next, equipped to find better solutions.We are constantly improving and innovating. The tireless pursuit of ‘better’ is our tradition. The example set by our founder, Herman DeVry, inspires us to elevate our programs, monitor the landscape, and partner with employers – so what we teach and how we teach is current, relevant, and effective. 



    Take the TechPath
  



TechPath is our distinctive learning approach that grew out of the understanding that students need a different kind of education to prepare them for a world that’s tech-intense, constantly changing and connected as never before through the digital mesh – an ever-expanding dynamic interaction of smart machines, information, applications and human beings.
    Every TechPath class you take, whether it’s in a business, health or tech program, revolves around a unique learning rubric developed at DeVry. We call it People-Process-Data-Devices or P2D2. You’ll gain real skills in collaboration, be able to adapt to new structures, create innovative ways of working, and be comfortable working with data and using a wide spectrum of tech-forward tools.

    P2D2 is a key component of what makes TechPath a smart, new way of getting the knowledge you need to be ready to hit the ground running in the new way successful companies work today.

    We’re proud to offer our TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1. Degree programs that offer a TechPath option are noted below.
1TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017. New TechPath pricing savings do not apply to certificate programs.




    TRANSFER UP TO 80 CREDIT HOURS



When transferring colleges or finishing your degree, you deserve credit for coursework you've already completed. DeVry University will help you apply qualifying credits — up to 80 credit hours — toward your degree program. If you’ve already earned an associate degree, you may be eligible for a “Block Transfer2” when enrolling in a related bachelor’s degree program of study. We work with students like you every day to help maximize qualifying transfer credits within DeVry’s degree programs and help make earning a degree more affordable. Your prior education matters. We want you to make the most of it.
Explore DeVry’s Program offerings below and request more information to learn how your transfer credits could help you complete your degree.
2The awarding of block credits varies by program and state. Additional coursework may be required in some programs to meet the prerequisites for upper-level courses in the major and/or to meet the state’s general education credit-hour requirements to confer a degree which may increase program length and financial obligations. Because of the differences in educational systems, a course-by-course evaluation will be completed for international students with foreign credentials/transcripts.

MTBC’s ICD-10 Compliance Roadmap


The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, or ICD-10 is a coding system that went into effect in the U.S. healthcare industry on Oct. 1, 2015. It is used to standardize codes for medical conditions and procedures. The ICD-10 codes have enabled more accurate medical billing by offering many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor ICD-9.
For thousands of physicians and other clinicians in the United States, the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 was a major concern demanding time, preparation, and a lengthy period of adjustment.  MTBC has proven to be an ideal ICD-10 compliance partner and remained fully committed in meeting all applicable time frames for ICD-10 compliance prior to October 2015.



 We have worked closely with our clients to ensure their smooth transition to ICD-10. To find out more about ICD-10 and its latest updates, please visit the  CMS site.

During the transition to ICD-10 period, we had implemented an ICD-10 adoption strategy that mainly focused on:

A mapping solution to ensure that our practices can look up ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes as well as ICD-10 to ICD-9 codes.
Targeted external testing with our clearing houses, such as Emdeon.
Targeted external testing with payer-organizations.
Internal ICD‐10 testing to ensure proper implementation of processes & policies.
Providing adequate guidance and training to our clients for a smooth transition from ICD 9 to ICD 10.
Extensive training on an organizational scale to equip our workforce with the required knowledge and competency.

Our streamlined business processes and technological solutions seamlessly accommodated this coding shift.  By October 1, 2015, the ICD-10 modifications to our practice management and EHR product suite were completed and fully functional. This has helped guarantee our clients’ successful and hassle-free transition to ICD-10.




MTBC ICD-10 Training and Coaching Services
Our ICD-10 coaching services encompassed the entire ICD-10 lifecycle from initial assessment to testing, and post-transition/implementation support. To simplify the coding transition, our HIT specialists:

FAQs regarding ICD-10 Transition for MTBC Clients






What is the current status of MTBC in regards to ICD-10?




MTBC successfully completed all the transition tasks well before the October 2015 deadline. MTBC made its ICD-9 to ICD-10 products available to clients to help them in testing their system and processes.








Was any mapping or crosswalk strategy used between ICD-9 and ICD-10 code sets? Were there any tools available as a crosswalk between ICD-9 and ICD-10?




MTBC did provide a mapping solution to ensure that all of its practices can look up ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes and vice versa. In some cases, there is a one-to-one match. However, in many cases, there is one ICD-9 code that maps many ICD-10 codes due to laterality and specificity within ICD-10. In other cases, there are many ICD-9 codes that map to a single ICD-10 code due to having more combination codes available in ICD-10. The major tools of MTBC’s WebEHR and Practice Management available for the purpose are:

ICD-9 to ICD-10 Code Converter.
ICD-9 to ICD-10 Converter Smart App.









In what time frame was the system modification process completed? What role did MTBC play in system testing?




MTBC successfully completed all ICD-10 modifications to its Practice Management and EHR solutions and made these available to our clients during Q-3 in 2015. This gave us ample time to engage in comprehensive internal testing and targeted end-to-end external testing. The modifications primarily included the development of the ICD-10 Translator in Practice Management as well as all of the EHR systems, increasing the ICD-10 field size to 7 characters along with creation of new CMS 1500 forms. We have also conducted extensive trainings for our coding staff about the ICD-10 coding system and its comparison and contrast with the current ICD-9 coding system.








Was there a cost involved in ICD-10 transition? Were the modifications and upgrades and ‘ICD-10 claims submission testing support’ covered by existing contracts?




No extra cost was passed down to our clients on account of the ICD-10 transition with our Practice Management and EHR solutions. Nor was there any impact on the contractual agreement between MTBC and its clients. Moreover, all the mentioned tools and upgrades during the ICD-10 transition were fully covered and did not interrupt MTBC clients’ cash and clinical workflow.








During the ICD-10 transition phase, have you provided customer support and training for the ICD-10-related functionality, and what were the charges? How did you provide the trainings (i.e. webinars or knowledge hub etc.)?




MTBC devised strategic plans to ensure efficient transition to the ICD-10 system without impacting clients’ workflow processes. In this regard, MTBC organized a series of free webinars to educate clients about the implications of ICD-10 coding standards.








Was there any phased approach for implementing ICD-10?




MTBC adopted a strategic plan for the ICD-10 implementation that encompassed various stages of development. The main phases for the implementation were:

Impact Assessment – (Q2 2013)
Internal Communication – (Q2 2013)
Implementation of ICD-10 development changes – (Q3 2013)
Internal Testing – (Q4 2013)
External testing with payers and clearing houses – (Q1 2015)
Client Education – (Q2 2015)
Going Live – (Q3 2015)









Is there any ICD-10 Translator available for customer use?




MTBC has already released its set of mHealth apps. Our standalone ICD-9 to ICD-10 converter app is available on play store/app store:


 










What was the overall impact of ICD-10 transition on the interfaces in use, such as electronic prescribing, lab interfaces and appointment reminders?




The ICD-10 developments had no impact on these interfaces and they remained fully ICD-10 compliant.








What role did MTBC play in the testing of ICD-10 claims? Have you coordinated with various payers/vendors/clearing houses about the ICD-10 claims?




MTBC successfully completed the testing of ICD-10 claims well before time. Other than the external testing with major vendors and clearing houses (including Emdeon and CMS) – we even remained in constant communication with other payers regarding the ICD-10 claims.








What is MTBC’s commitment to reviewing and troubleshooting the claims post ICD-10 implementation (post 10/01/15)?




MTBC is fully committed to ensure that claims of our clients are not negatively affected by the ICD-10 transition. We are in constant communication with Emdeon (our claims clearinghouse) to make the transition process error free for our clients. Additionally, MTBC’s support staff remains available 24/7 to answer queries and provide technical support or educational resources.

Letter to Medical Transcription Billing Shareholders - Medical Transcription Billing (NASDAQ:MTBC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Letter to Medical Transcription Billing ShareholdersJul.17.17 | About: Medical Transcription (MTBC) Bill Korn Chief Financial Officer, healthcare, tech, micro-capMTBC Investor RelationsSummaryFirst half 2017 revenue was approximately $16 million – an increase of approximately 55% over the first half of 2016.Q2 2017 adjusted EBITDA was positive, likely marking our highest positive adjusted EBITDA in our history as a public company.Q2 2017 GAAP net loss was significantly lower than the Q1 2017 net loss, with almost 90% of the Q2 net loss attributable to non-cash amortization and depreciation.MTBC ended Q2 with approximately $5.8 million cash on our balance sheet.MTBC is well positioned to meet or exceed our full-year 2017 guidance of $30-31 million of revenue with $2.0-2.5 million of positive adjusted EBITDA.

 The first half of 2017 was a breakthrough period for Medical Transcription Billing Corp. (Nasdaq: MTBC). Above are some highlights of what we expect to officially report on August 3, after our independent accountants review our financial statements for the second quarter. We are very grateful to our common shareholders who have enthusiastically responded to the success of our strategy, and the investors in our non-convertible Series A Preferred Stock who purchased an additional $7.4 million of our preferred stock in a follow-on offering in late June. Our successful Q2 capital raise and transition to positive adjusted EBITDA, which will lead to positive cash flow from operations, are empowering us to further strengthen our balance sheet as we increase cash, reduce debt, and invest in growth initiatives. These internal achievements come at a great time, since we view the industry as being at an inflection point that presents significant opportunities to MTBC. During the first half of 2017, we observed a continued acceleration in the transformation of the regulations, business models and insurance reimbursement structures that form the framework of the healthcare industry, and these transformations are driving healthcare providers to our solution. These changes challenge the near- and long-term viability of practicing medicine and obtaining insurance reimbursement without a strong technology partner and support a paradigm shift to a comprehensive solution, such as the one we provide.
 During the most recent quarter, we announced the launch of MTBC WebSoft – the newest addition to our leading cloud-based healthcare IT platform which supports scalability, acquisition integration, and margin expansion – and the successful phase one launch of our next-generation, voice-enabled electronic health records solution, talkEHR. Our global team of approximately 250 software development and technology professionals is ensuring that our platform remains out-front and that we can leverage the opportunities – organic and acquisitive – that we see in the market. I’m fortunate to be part of an accomplished team that is passionate about providing excellent solutions to our clients and leveraging the many growth opportunities that are presenting themselves. Our story is beginning to resonate more clearly and loudly with investors and other stakeholders – and our year-to-date performance marks a pivotal new chapter in our story, which we believe will be followed by additional exciting chapters in the months and years ahead. I hope you will join us at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Thursday, August 3, 2017, when our management team will host a conference call to discuss the first half 2017 results. The live webcast of the conference call can be accessed under Events & Presentations at ir.mtbc.com. A replay of the conference call, as well as investor presentations, interviews with management, press releases and access to all our SEC filings are available at the same link. Many sincere thanks for your support, Bill Korn Chief Financial Officer Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In our earnings releases, prepared remarks, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by SEC Regulation G.

As a result, I am a contrarian. Studying the history of financialization, I have to agree with value investors like Seth Klarman, George Soros, and John Quiggin that markets are ultimately inefficient. However, I am not an orthodox value-investor. I believe in diversified strategy so as to insure maximum gains while maintaining a "margin of safety." Understanding that markets will operate inefficiently, I sometimes find "playing the greater fool's game" will yield nice short term gains. I have been investing for five years and have had proven results. I offer unique insight on fundamentals that most analysts do not consider. Cornelius Vanderbilt has done more than any other man to shape our idea of investing. He was the ultimate contrarian. As an investor he looked for both value and risk. His approach to markets is complex and contradictory but can be learned from.

Since 1931, DeVry University has harnessed the power of technology to innovate education. We bring our founder’s perspective to education. We try new things, look at challenges in new ways, and vigorously question precedent. Then and now, we’ve helped our students understand the ever-changing world. 
Today, DeVry University continues Herman DeVry’s spirit of innovation and inquiry and curiosity and forward-thinking. We teach how technology integrates people, process, data and devices to solve modern business problems. We show a sharp, clear picture of the modern landscape so students can see how to advance in it. 
Technology is at our core and embedded in our programs – because it’s at the core of business, healthcare and tech, everywhere. Our students dig deeper into understanding technology’s role in all things…so they can be ready for whatever comes next.

            "The Career Step training program got me in the door for a medical transcription job without having to have any medical transcription work experience. If I had trained through any other medical transcription program, I don't think that getting a job would have been this easy." -Beth, Texas

            "We've hired a number of Career Step graduates, and we've been very happy with the quality of the work that they've done at our organization. We love the way that the program tests and evaluates them along the process, and it's really helped us select those who are really shining stars." -Dave Jensen, CEO of Aviacode

            "I was able to get a job within 3 weeks of graduating, which was largely related to the Career Step name on my resume. I have talked to people and read that many new grads from other schools are looking for work for 4 to 6 months. I love my job and, while I am still learning the details of the job, I was well prepared for the work!" -Amanda, Texas

            "I just got hired by a prestigious MT company. I graduated from Career Step 1 month and 12 days before. When I heard that honors graduates, on average, get jobs within a month of graduating, I was very skeptical.  . . .Career Step is the main reason I got the job that I did. My new employers said they only hire from Career Step and one other MT program. They are very familiar with the quality of Career Step's training and do not even require testing if you graduated recently.

            " -April

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
