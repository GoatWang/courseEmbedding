 OVERVIEW  
 AUTHOR BIO 



Woody Plants in North America is an interactive multimedia identification tutorial for woody plants found throughout North America. The software was developed over a 15-year period at Virginia Tech in cooperation with tree identification experts at Oregon State University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Georgia.¬†
The software includes a morphology section that illustrates common terms used to describe twigs, leaves, flowers, fruit, bark, and form of woody plants. The main body of the tutorial contains over 23,000 images (including range maps), and full text descriptionsof leaves, twigs, fruit, flowers, bark, and form for 920 speciesof woody plants. Numerous photographs are annotated to highlight the most critical distinguishing features. Both native and common ornamental woody plants are included. Multiple pictures of important distinguishing features help you develop a "feel" for normal variation expected in the field. Each feature of similar species can also be compared side by side with the most distinguishing features highlighted.¬†¬†
The scientific names used in the program for a particular species are those accepted by the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov). Synonyms are displayed while viewing a species by moving the cursor over the plant name.

Advisory Committee on Higher Education Cost Efficiencies 
On September 9, 2009, Governor Rick Perry issued Executive Order RP 73 which directs the Coordinating Board, in cooperation with Texas public institutions of higher education to undertake a broad and comprehensive review of system-wide opportunities for achieving cost efficiencies, including, but not limited to: state funding based on student course completion; restructuring the state‚Äôs financial aid programs to improve administrative efficiencies and to provide financial aid to students who work hard to academically prepare for college; academic program consolidation and elimination of programs that produce relatively few graduates; faculty workload; articulation agreements between two-year and four-year institutions; distance learning; alternatives to creating new campuses; course redesign to improve quality and reduce instructional costs for more courses; cooperative, cross-system contracting and purchasing; space utilization; energy use; and cost of instructional materials. In addition, the 81st Texas Legislature passed House Bill 4149 by Representative Patrick Rose which directs the Coordinating Board to conduct a study to identify achievable cost-saving measures in the management and operation of institutions of higher education, including the use and availability of electronic textbooks. The Coordinating Board created the Advisory Committee on Higher Education Cost Efficiencies comprised of higher education and business leaders to undertake these mandates. The Advisory Committee held its first organizational meeting on December 3, 2009 and will meet once a month in Austin according to the schedule which can be accessed further below. The Coordinating Board will have its final recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature by November 1, 2010.

        In addressing shortage, new dental school to open in Western Texas
    


September 09, 2016

El Paso, Texas ‚Äî In an effort to address a shortage of dentists in the region, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso announced Sept. 6 that it will open the state‚Äôs fourth dental school, estimated to open in 2020.

The Woody L. Hunt School of Dental Medicine will be the first dental school to open in the state in nearly 50 years and the first to be located in West Texas and on the U.S.-Mexico border. The school is expected to admit about 25 students in its first year.

‚ÄúOur region is severely underserved when it comes to dentistry, and by establishing a school here in the heart of the [region], we expect to retain dentists in our area to help fill this gap,‚Äù said university President Richard Lange, M.D.

El Paso County has been classified as a dental Health Professional Shortage Area by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a news release. The county currently has about one dentist for every 5,000 residents, compared to the state average of one for ever 2,760, according to a Texas Department of State Health Services study.

The shortage has significant consequences on access to health care and overall health, according to Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, adding that less than half of El Paso adults visit the dentist annually.

The opening of the new dental school is made possible due to a $25 million gift from the Woody and Gayle Hunt Family Foundation, a private family foundation founded in 1987.





Opening 2020: (From left) Richard Lange, M.D., president of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso; Gayle Hunt and Woody Hunt, of Gayle Hunt Family Foundation; Rick Frances, Texas Tech University System regent; and Robert L. Duncan, Texas Tech University System chancellor pose for a photo during the Sept. 6 announcement event of the opening of the Woody L. Hunt School of Dental Medicine. The dental school, set to open in 2020, will become Texas‚Äô fourth dental school and the first in West Texas.





‚ÄúThis landmark gift from the Woody and Gayle Hunt Family Foundation, in partnership with [the university] and its mission to improve the lives of our community members, is a testament to the tremendous impact that a few can make by touching the lives of many,‚Äù said Victoria Pineda, associate vice chancellor.

Currently, Texas‚Äô three dental schools are located in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas ‚Äî all more than 500 miles away from El Paso. Together, the three schools graduate about 300 students a year, according to the news release. However, between 2007 and 2011, only 13 graduates or 1.25 percent took up practice in El Paso.

‚ÄúOur immediate goal is to attract bright medical talent and young men and women who are eager to stay in El Paso to practice dentistry,‚Äù said Woody Hunt, foundation chairman. ‚ÄúIn the longer term, the school will help alleviate oral health problems in our region, as well as serve as a significant enhancement to our overall quality of life in the [region].‚Äù

The new dental school will apply for approval from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and accreditation from the Commission on Dental Accreditation.
