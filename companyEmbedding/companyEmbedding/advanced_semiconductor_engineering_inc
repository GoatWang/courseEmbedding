About ASE
Global Leadership
The ASE Group is the world’s largest provider of independent semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and test. The group develops and offers complete turnkey solutions covering IC packaging, design and production of interconnect materials, front-end engineering test, wafer probing and final test, as well as electronic manufacturing services through USI, Inc. As global leader, ASE provides a complete scope of services for the semiconductor market, driven by superior technologies, breakthrough innovations, and advanced development programs.



Semiconductors are the basic building blocks used to create electronic products and systems. Increasingly we are moving towards more sophisticated semiconductor applications, driven by market demands for faster, smarter, portable and integrated electronic products. In such products, the tiny semiconductor chip is constantly being pushed to greater limits.


Semiconductor manufacturing consists of many processes - design of the integrated circuit (IC), preliminary testing of the viability of the design, wafer fabrication, packaging and final testing of the IC.

Our Capabilities
ASE is capable of providing services at all stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process, with the exception of wafer fabrication.
Our service capabilities range from front-end engineering testing, wafer probing, packaging and final test. We also provide design manufacturing service from board design to systems assembly through USI, Inc., an ASE group member.

Front-end engineering test is the testing of semiconductor prototypes before they go into volume production. Our services include software development, electrical verification, reliability analysis and failure analysis.

Wafer probing is a process whereby each individual die (chip) on the wafer is tested for defects to identify operable semiconductors for packaging.
Packaging, also known as assembly, is the processing of bare semiconductors into finished semiconductors, serving to protect the die and facilitate electrical connections and heat dissipation. We offer a broad range of semiconductor packages meeting the diverse function and cost requirements of our customers.

Final testing of semiconductors ensures that they function properly before being shipped to customers or assembled in electronic products.

Members of the ASE Group
Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc.(TAIEX: 2311, NYSE: ASX), a leading company of semiconductor assembly and test services.
USI, Inc., a leading electronic manufacturing service provider.

State-of-the-art Process Technologies
As the industry focuses on integrating more functions onto a single chip and chip performance increases with improvements in process technologies, packaging has gained even greater importance. Computing frequency of next generation chips are becoming higher and functions packed onto each chip are increasing. Consequently, requirements for thermal and electrical reliability are rising exponentially. Semiconductor designers need to explore advanced packaging methods to satisfy these requirements.

Innovation and quality are values that ASE prides itself for delivering leading-edge technologies and solutions to customers, meeting their demanding requirements such as electrical performance, heat dissipation, cost and aggressive cycle time. ASE continues to invest the maximum in research and development through its high caliber engineering teams and advanced manufacturing processes.

The advanced manufacturing process technologies that we provide include flip chip and wafer bumping, 300mm wafer bumping and test, Chip Scale Packaging (CSP), 3D packages and System in Package (SiP). We also offer standard products such as PDIP, SOJ, SSOP and PLCC. Our broad product portfolio provides customers the flexibility to select package types that best suit the needs of their chip designs.

ASE has also developed lead-free solutions to eliminate lead in electronic interconnections from both the legislative and competitive sides. We have investigated and tested the performance of various types of lead free solders to generate alternative semiconductor package applications that grant our customers environmentally-friendly chip packages without compromising the reliability.

Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. Pins Modest Guidance on Smartphone Delays
The chip packaging veteran's customers are running into inventory gluts in China and delayed phone designs everywhere.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)

Semiconductor packaging and testing expert Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (NYSE:ASX) reported first-quarter results early Friday morning. Here's what investors need to know about this business update.

Data source: Advanced Semiconductor Engineering.
What happened with ASE this quarter?
ASE's revenues rose 7% year over year in local currency. Currency exchange effects added another 6% growth in U.S. dollar terms.

The company reported solid year-over-year sales growth in the three largest of its five business segments. Electronic manufacturing services led the way with 19% higher sales in local currency, followed by 6% gains in the testing and packaging divisions.
Bottom-line earnings fell despite strong sales growth, mainly due to a $127 million non-cash charge to account for valuation changes in ASE's financial assets and liabilities.
The pending merger with industry rival Siliconware Precision Industries (NASDAQ:SPIL) moved closer to completion this quarter. In April, China's Ministry of Commerce formally accepted the merger contract with no objections. The companies hope to close this deal "as soon as possible," awaiting a final rubber stamp from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Management provided guidance for the next quarter in sweeping terms:

For electronic manufacturing services, the "business should be similar to the average of 2Q16 and 3Q16 levels." That would work out to segment revenue near $850 million and gross margins for that segment in the 10% range, down from $974 million and 10.6% in the first quarter.
Together, the remaining four segments should deliver results similar to the first quarter. That's $1.3 billion in combined segment sales at a gross margin of roughly 23%.
Total sales growth based on these targets would work out to approximately 6% in local currencies, and gross profit margins are holding steady in general.

What management had to say
In a conference call with analysts, company representative Ken Hsiang offered an overview of how the semiconductor industry is shaping up around ASE right now. According to a transcript from Seeking Alpha, Hsiang said:

We believe that some of our customers are actively controlling component inventory related to smartphones in China. This seems to indicate that the China smartphone market is taking sometime to digest inventory, after showing surprising resilience during 2016.
Further, we also have noted that some end products have adjusted their launch timing not matching their previous generations launch times. Some of these times are off by weeks, some by potentially months. We believe these product launch shifts have created timing shifts in various smartphone manufacturing cycles.

Looking ahead
Positioned at the center of the semiconductor manufacturing process flow, ASE can be a useful barometer for the state of the chip industry and other markets. Hsiang's comments point to delayed smartphone designs in China and elsewhere, but the sales growth curve remains strong despite that caveat.
That being said, the Siliconware merger is inching close to the finish line, here, and ASX can't wait to get its hands on those predictably positive cash flows.
