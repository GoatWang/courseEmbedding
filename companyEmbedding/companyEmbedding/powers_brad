By Shawn Parr6 minute Read“Brand” as a concept is misunderstood, underappreciated,  and very often underutilized.advertisementWhen brand comes up in a meeting, it often means different things to different people, and many executives speak the language of brand the way some of us speak Spanish: with a limited vocabulary and rotten accent. And while being fluent in another language is helpful, not understanding the definition, and differentiating value and places to deploy it properly can be highly problematic. Despite the excellent books, many courses, and conferences dedicated to brand, there is still confusion surrounding its meaning and how it should be operationalized even within the most sophisticated companies.At Bulldog Drummond, one of our key practices guides a wide range of organizations, from multi-billion dollar internationals to passionate startups and not-for-profits, to define and unlock the power of their brand (whether it’s refreshing or repositioning tired brands or building new-to-world brands from scratch). We are most often hired by the executive team, venture firm, or private equity group driving the business to help explore and define the brand’s relevance and reason for being–and we’re often asked to explore the permission that brand has to stretch or expand.After working with so many leadership teams to develop and refresh brands, I’ve come to the realization that brands are like people and people are like brands. They are complex, and like great people great brands are dimensional; they have a soul, personality and behaviors that differentiate them from others. They leave an impression and invite you to engage with them. Great brands are interesting and make it clear why people need them, and it’s from this vantage point that I’d like to offer a few key areas to help you think about the power of brand.Brand is the sum of many parts.
Why do so many executives who talk about brand not understand its full potential as a business asset? Many see it from a single tactical dimension instead of its entirety. Many mistakenly see brand as the logo, an ad campaign or what’s on product packaging. They don’t understand the strategic power that a fully articulated brand platform holds when deployed across all areas of the business.Take a minute to think about a friend who stands out from the crowd, who has made an impression on others. Now think about why they’re memorable? The impression we create when we meet other people is formed by the way we behave, the way we look and dress, the way we communicate and the value we deliver. In the same way we form opinions about people, we form opinions about brands. Brand is the impression we have of a product or a service and is based on the sum of our experiences and interactions with it. Everything a brand does matters.Brand is rational and emotional.
Like people, brands have two sides: the rational and the emotional. Both sides need to be clearly defined and deployed for a brand to unlock its full potential. Think of a brand like a person living with purpose, adding value to people’s lives and operating with a set of guiding principles. Start with being clear why your brand exists and what it’s trying to accomplish and then think about how it should behave to ensure it’s relevant and memorable. The rational side is built on the passion to solve a problem or meet an unmet or unrealized need, and this informs and fuels the brand’s purpose or reason for being. Just like a person who operates with integrity, a brand should have a clearly defined set of principles or values that guide how it behaves. The principles form the rational building blocks for the brand, and combined with a clear mission (what you intend to do to achieve your purpose) and a clear strategy (the immediate actions you will take to deliver on your mission) a working platform is formed to guide the brand’s actions so they are relevant, coordinated and consistent.advertisementThe brand strategy should guide and inform the brand’s personality and behavior, working together to inform the emotional connections it makes with the people it serves. The strategy should inform everything the brand does, the actions it takes, the places it appears and how it engages, educates and entertains. The emotional side of the brand is brought to life by all forms of memorable and relevant brand expression across internal (company culture) and external (consumer-facing) touchpoints. These touchpoints include the experience design of the product or service, visual, written and dimensional communication, advertising, outreach, customer service and the overall experience before, during and after purchase. Brand differentiates.
Just like memorable people, brands that stand out from the crowd do so because they intrigue people, are memorable and different. Compelling brands are relevant, engaging, entertaining and more often than not, courageous. They take a stand for or against something and have the confidence to stand apart from the crowd. People remember compelling brands and know what to expect from them.Your brand is one of the most important assets you possess to drive and differentiate your business. If your brand is not clearly defined, understood and embraced by the entire organization it will never realize its full potential to impact your business. It’s important to ensure that there is understanding and clarity around what brand means in business terms and what it can do to drive innovation, communication and differentiation. And then it is imperative to have complete alignment on your brand platform with your entire executive team. Your brand is one of the most powerful drivers for engagement and performance across all areas of your business. Brand does not belong to marketing. 
Every CEO must be the leading brand ambassador and ensure every department head understands how to bring the brand to life at their level of the company. Because finance experts or lawyers lead many corporations, they often rely on the CMO to own and champion the brand. But just as culture isn’t the sole responsibility of HR, brand is not the sole responsibility of marketing. While the execution of many dimensions of brand, specifically expression and communication, traditionally sit with marketing the entire executive team has the responsibility to ensure they understand and champion the brand through their words, actions, and behaviors—and bring it to life through their function of the business. Every department in the company has a role to play in bringing the brand to life and to ensure it is alive, vibrant and maximized. Brand needs love and attention.
Just like people, brands need to be carefully nurtured and managed, and like people, they get old and tired and need reinvigorating. Every CMO should perform a regular health check on their brand. I don’t mean looking at brand awareness research, but fully understanding the health of your brand internally. Do regular refresher sessions on brand for all key leaders. Starbucks just spent $35 million to make sure its staffers are passionately connected and understand who they are and where they are going as an organization.Brand clarity drives confidence and performance.
We’ve spent the past 18 months working with the CEO and executive team of a national brand that needed to redefine its reason for being and its place in the world. The business was in significant danger, with sales down by 8% year-over-year, stock prices at a 52-week low, employees operating with an unclear business strategy, and a languishing culture. One of the most significant issues holding the company back was the lack of alignment around brand and what it meant to the business.advertisementAfter working collaboratively with the executive team to develop a new brand platform and mobilize their organization of 60,000 people around it, same store sales increased by 11%, their stock price hit a 52-week high and their employee engagement significantly increased. This turnaround took courage, commitment, and patience to drive change, and the single most important catalyst was brand clarity. Like confident people, brands that operate with clarity generally deliver more consistent results.–Shawn Parr is the CEO of Bulldog Drummond, an innovation and design consultancy headquartered in San Diego whose clients and partners have included Starbucks, Diageo, Jack in the Box, Adidas, MTV, Nestle, Pinkberry, American Eagle Outfitters, Ideo, Virgin, Disney, Nike, Mattel, Heineken, Annie’s Homegrown, The Michael J.

Understanding the Power of a Brand Name

A brand name can be one of the most valuable assets a company possesses. It can lend credibility to product efficacy and provide an assurance of quality, letting consumers know what they can expect when they buy a product. But because brand building can be costly and time consuming, it can be extremely advantageous for established brands to lend their name to a new item in the same category through line extensions. In fact, line extensions are approximately three to four times more common than “new manufacturer” and “new brand” launches combined.
For consumers, line extensions create confidence in a new product’s ability to deliver against promises, and can relieve some of the apprehension often associated with trying something new. Nielsen’s Global New Product Innovation Survey found that nearly six-in-10 global respondents (59%) prefer to buy new products from brands familiar to them, and 21% say they purchased a new product because it was from a brand they like. Consumers in North America and Latin America value brand recognition more than consumers in any other region. In both, it was the second-most important reason (after affordability) that consumers said they purchase a new product.
Brand recognition is particularly influential in developing markets. On average, more than two-thirds of developing-market respondents (68%) say they prefer to buy new products from brands they’re familiar with, compared with 57% in developed markets. In addition, more than one-fifth of developing-market respondents (22%) say they purchased a new product because it was from a brand they like, compared with 17% in developed markets.
“Brands can signify quality and inspire confidence,” said Rob Wengel, senior vice president and managing director of Nielsen Innovation in the U.S. “For a consumer with limited disposable income, the potential loss from an underperforming product is magnified. As a result, they’re often hesitant to take a risk on a product that might not live up to expectations, and are sometimes even willing to pay more for brands they trust. For new products launched without the benefit of a strong brand name, extra care must be taken to provide strong assurance that the product will be perceived as a good value for the money.”
It is important to keep in mind, however, that while a brand extension can provide a strong foundation for success, it doesn’t guarantee it. In fact, if a company doesn’t manage a line extension well, it could actually harm the parent brand. To protect a brand’s reputation, a line extension should clearly link with the core product while also offering consistency, uniqueness and relevance in the market. Line extensions with little differentiation could lead to cannibalization. Likewise, if a line extension varies too dramatically from the parent, it can dilute sales. 

Consider Convenience
Time pressures and stress are facts of life. Shoppers want products that help restore balance and free up time to do the things they value most. More than one-fifth of global respondents (22%) say they purchased a new product because it was convenient, and slightly fewer (19%) say they purchased it because it made their life easier. Consumers’ desire for these kinds of products is even higher. More than one-quarter of global respondents say they wish more products were available that make their life easier (27%) and are convenient to use (26%).
While convenience-motivated purchasing is rated high in all regions, shopper sentiment differs in regard to the order of importance in certain regions. In Latin America, for example, respondents list convenience after branded, indulgent and family-friendly products, while in Europe, products that offer novelty, indulgence and brand recognition are more important than convenience. 

Other findings include:

In-depth looks at the top reasons consumers try new products by region.
Developed vs. developing regional appetites for new products.
The effectiveness of free samples in new product awareness/trial.
New products have cross-generational appeal, and aren’t just for the young.

About the Nielsen Global Survey
The Nielsen Global New Product Innovation Survey was conducted between Feb. 23 - March 13, 2015, and polled more than 30,000 consumers in 60 countries throughout Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and North America. For the purposes of this study, we defined a new product as any item a consumer has never purchased before. The sample has quotas based on age and sex for each country based on its Internet users and is weighted to be representative of Internet consumers. It has a margin of error of ±0.6%. This Nielsen survey is based only on the behavior of respondents with online access. Internet penetration rates vary by country. Nielsen uses a minimum reporting standard of 60% Internet penetration or an online population of 10 million for survey inclusion. The Nielsen Global Survey, which includes the Global Consumer Confidence Index, was established in 2005.

Would you like to see your beverages in these stores?







A few simple tips on selling beveragesMakes sure you are selling beverages that consumers are interested in buying? Test your idea by asking consumers to try your product and try and decide whether your beverage is unique (different) or better (higher quality) than the competitors. Make sure you can produce your product for the right price? Carefully analyze the cost of making your beverages, container, closure, label, ingredients, cost of filling, other packaging and transportation cost. You must be 100% sure of cost. Make sure you can produce enough product and have it ready on time? Check with your suppliers and find out exactly how long it takes to produce the raw materials you will need to manufacture your drinks and when they can be ready to go. Make sure you set the right whole sale price (price to distributors) & retail pricing (price to stores) and finally the price that consumers pay for the product (manufacturers suggested retail price - MSRP)? Leave enough room to make a profit. Make sure you are prepared for the buyers? You will need to prepare retail and distributor presentations that include your pricing (above) and your marketing and promotional plan. These presentations should be robust and visually appealing. Learn all about selling beverages successfully. Request Free Information >- click images to scroll our portfolio -

Retailer Incentive Program








When you are launching a new beverage brand, securing the support of the retailer is crucial. In order to get more shelf space, it is very effective to offer some sort of incentive program directly to the retailer. More >







Often it is a good strategy to begin by giving a free case of product to the retailer and have them try the product for themselves. Once they have sampled the beverage, they will be much more inclined to purchase. A “buy two cases get one free” inducement can also yield a satisfactory end result. Additionally, offering incentives like coupons, promotions, guaranteed sale, and distributor bill-back can be just the positive push the retailer needs to agree to sell your beverage. Learn More >

Thank you! Our friendly beverage experts will be in touch with you to discuss your beverage business.












When offering an incentive program to retailers, it is important to consider several things. Knowing your audience is important and can be achieved with an in-store customer survey. Once this knowledge is gained, it can be utilized to assess the most effective method of incentive. Budget evaluation is an important part of planning an incentive program as well. Incentives cost money short term but the long term gain ideally outweighs these costs. Learn More >Offering incentives is a proven method with both the customers and your business winning as an outcome.Power Brands is a qualified consultant with experience in audience and market assessment, budget evaluation, and the implementation of strategies which will set your beverage up for success. Learn More >

Briggs & Stratton


                Briggs & Stratton Corporation, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is the world’s largest producer of gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment. Since its founding in 1908, Briggs & Stratton has manufactured all sorts of products cultivating both a legacy and a culture of innovation that continues to propel the company today. A breakthrough came when in 1953 Briggs & Stratton introduced the first lightweight aluminum engine. These durable and reliable small gasoline engines would revolutionize the lawn and garden industry. Today Briggs & Stratton engines walk-behind lawn mowers, riding lawn mowers, garden tillers, and snow throwers; and industrial, construction, agricultural and other consumer applications including generators and pressure washers. The company also manufactures and supplies genuine OEM engines and parts for service, repair and replacement.

Briggs & Stratton products are designed, manufactured, marketed and serviced in over 100 countries on six continents.
