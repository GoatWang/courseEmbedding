These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer



                            Shop Now
                        

Get your free keychain remote!


After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.
                        
                    

                        We put our money where our mouth is: you can try us 
                        completely risk free, with three amazing guarantees. 
                        SimpliSafe comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee
                        

1. Satisfaction. Guaranteed.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.

I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.

“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”

When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.

Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!

What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.
