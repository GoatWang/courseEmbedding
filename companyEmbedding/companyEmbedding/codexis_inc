Biocatalyst Platforms






 


















Biocatalyst Platforms
Codexis’ biocatalyst platforms include:
 


Ketoreductases (KRED) Our KREDs use nicotinamide cofactors as electron donors to reduce carbonyls to alcohols. Most Codexis KREDs are capable of recycling the cofactor with the aid of isopropanol (IPA), generating acetone which can be readily removed from the reaction. Some KREDs require the use of a glucose/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) system for cofactor recycling. To meet this need, Codexis supplies stable and economical GDHs “off-the-shelf”.





Transaminases (ATA) Our ATAs are versatile enzymes that use isopropylamine as an amine donor to convert ketones to chiral amines in one step. The resulting byproduct is acetone, which can be stripped from the reaction mixture, thereby driving the reaction to the side of the amine. Codexis developed the first (R)-selective ATA that tolerated larger substituents on both sides of the substrate carbonyl.





Imine Reductases (IRED) Our IREDs have been engineered to exhibit totally novel intermolecular reductive amination activity on unactivated substrates. The IREDs catalyze the formation of secondary and tertiary amines through the coupling of amines with carbonyls to form imines, and their subsequent reduction. They enable the biocatalytic implementation of the highly versatile and synthetically useful reductive animation reaction. And can provide access to complex amine products in a single step.





Nitrilases (NIT) Nitrilases are useful enzymes capable of hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids at neutral pH and ambient temperature. They are stereoselective and in some cases also generate amide intermediates.





Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenases (BVMO) Our BVMOs have been developed for asymmetric sulfoxidation using ambient oxygen as the oxidant. Because this reaction requires a nicotinamide cofactor, a KRED and isopropanol or a GDH and glucose are added to the system to recycle the cofactor. The relevant KRED or GDH are available from Codexis.





Monoamine Oxidases (MAOs) Our MAOs use ambient oxygen as an oxidant, providing a safe and mild way to generate imines from amines. Our MAOs have proven useful in the desymmetrization of bicyclic pyrrolidine compounds in the synthesis of hepatitis C drugs.





Halohydrin Dehalogenases (HHDH) Our HHDH platform was developed for the production of ethyl (R)-(−)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate, the first chiral building block in the synthesis of the atorvastatin side chain. These enzymes generate epoxides from halohydrins, and in turn open epoxides with certain nucleophiles.





Ene Reductases (ERED) EREDs are capable of reducing carbon-carbon double bonds using a nicotinamide cofactor as the electron donor. A KRED/IPA or GDH/glucose system can be used for cofactor regeneration. The relevant KRED or GDH are available from Codexis.





Acylases (ACY) Our acylase platform is derived from penicillin G acylase. The ACY variants are highly selective and have improved activity and stability over the native enzyme.





MicroCyps® (MCYP®) Our MCYP® enzymes provide medicinal chemists with exclusive and unique tools to produce metabolites and generate potentially new leads. Our bacterial cytochrome P450 (CYPs) variants contain mutations that result in robust biocatalysts, with higher productivity over mammalian CYPs. Our variants are capable of producing most human metabolites, as well as novel compounds. These enzymes are readily scalable to produce gram quantities of desired product(s).

Codexis Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2017Back to CDXS Snapshot

Share Story4:05PM ET 5/09/2017 Globe NewswireProduct sales increase 49% 
Highlights include signing second multiyear agreement in the food industry and initiating beta testing of first company-developed enzyme for the molecular diagnostics industry 
Conference call begins at 4:30 pm Eastern time today
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., May  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Codexis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDXS), a leading protein engineering company, announces financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and provides a business update.
"Codexis delivered a solid start to 2017 with product sales increasing 49%, reaching the top of our range for full-year product sales growth.  I am especially pleased that those sales were recorded at gross margins that exceed our guidance range for the year," said Codexis President and CEO John Nicols.  "These results show our continued execution toward a third consecutive year of translating our protein catalyst and enzyme pipeline into sustained product sales growth. Product sales were again led by deliveries to Merck, as well as significant aggregate sales to several generic pharmaceutical customers. Additionally, we shipped a large order that advanced the timeline for switching the manufacturing process of another major pharmaceutical company's patented, commercially available drug to use our proprietary protein catalyst.
"We have delivered a number of strategic successes year-to-date," he added.  "First on the list is the signing of our second multiyear agreement with Tate & Lyle. We have already staffed the research project for improving their target food ingredient process and received a payment in the low single-digit million dollar range, which we will start to recognize in the second quarter. Second, we filed our first patent application and began beta testing the first Codexis-developed enzyme for the molecular diagnostics industry. We also welcomed new shareholders to Codexis, who along with participation by several existing shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet with a successful follow-on equity offering in early April. We are well-positioned to accelerate execution of multiple growth initiatives and further capitalize on the versatility of our CodeEvolver® protein engineering technology," Mr. Nicols concluded.
First Quarter Financial HighlightsTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $8.0 million, unchanged from the first quarter of 2016. Product sales for the first quarter of 2017 increased 49% to $5.6 million from $3.7 million for the prior-year period due to increased demand for enzymes for both generic and branded products. Research and development revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $2.0 million compared with $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2016, which included the recognition of a milestone payment from a collaboration agreement with a major biopharmaceutical company, as well as $1.1 million from the combined pro-rata revenue recognition of previously received upfront payments from GlaxoSmithKline and Merck. These prior-year events were partly offset in the first quarter of 2017 by a significant increase in service revenues from Merck and another major pharmaceutical customer for development of an enzyme being used to manufacture the customer's already commercialized drug. Revenue from the revenue-sharing arrangement with Exela PharmSci for sales of the argatroban injectable drug was $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2016.
Gross margin on product sales for the first quarter of 2017 increased to 46% from 33% for the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to an increase in sales of higher-margin products.
Research and development (R&D) expenses were $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2016, with the increase due to higher outside services expense and increased costs associated with higher headcount, which was partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $6.6 million from $6.8 million for the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to lower legal fees and outside services expense, offset in part by increased costs associated with higher headcount.
The net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $7.5 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with a net loss for the first quarter of 2016 of $7.0 million, or $0.17 per share. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $5.5 million, or $0.13 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2016 of $4.3 million, or $0.11 per share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided below.
Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 were $13.9 million, compared with $19.2 million as of December 31, 2016.  Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 did not include the payment received from Tate & Lyle in May 2017 relating to the agreement signed on March 31, 2017. On April 12, 2017, Codexis completed a public offering of common stock raising net proceeds of $23.3 million. 
Financial OutlookCodexis is affirming its financial guidance for 2017 as follows:
Total revenues of $50 million to $53 million, which assumes revenues related to the company's third non-exclusive CodeEvolver® license agreement, which is expected in the second half of 2017.
Product sales of $21 million to $23 million, an increase of 37% to 50% over 2016.
Gross margin on product sales between 37% and 39%.
Total operating expenses for R&D and SG&A to increase by 6% to 8% over 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, financial measures exclude non-cash items such as depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP financial measures presented are: non-GAAP net income or loss, non-GAAP net income or loss per share (basic and diluted), and non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP research and development expense and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets.
Codexis management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate its operating results and trends on an ongoing basis, and internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Codexis management believes the non-GAAP information is useful for investors by offering them the ability to identify trends in what management considers to be Codexis' core operating results and to better understand how management evaluates the business. These non-GAAP measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all items of expense that affect Codexis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measurements required by GAAP, and therefore these non-GAAP results should only be used for evaluation in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. A description of the non-GAAP calculations and reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the accompanying table entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures."

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items:
(a) Depreciation expense: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes depreciation expense related to the depreciation of property and equipment. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the acquisition of property and equipment, and the corresponding depreciation expense, can be inconsistent in amount and can vary from period to period.
(b) Intangible asset amortization: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which primarily relate to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because this expense is non-cash. This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Company's competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include or exclude other items. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share or other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(c) Stock-based compensation: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes expenses for stock-based compensation. We believe the exclusion of this item allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operations. We also believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of Codexis' operating results to prior periods as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types.

Technology[edit]
Codexis engineers custom enzymes and microorganisms, which are sometimes referred to as biocatalysts. Codexis' proprietary technology called CodeEvolver is directed evolution technology based on the concept that natural genetic mutation and selection can be accelerated in the research laboratory to obtain specific improvements in the function of single proteins and multiprotein pathways. CodeEvolver combines DNA shuffling and bioinformatics with systems biology to create new biocatalysts.
Chemicals[edit]
Codexis is using its work in biofuels to develop sustainable sources for the 2 million ton detergent alcohol market.[2] Detergent alcohols go into household products such as shampoo and conditioner. Approximately 70% of detergent alcohols are derived from palm kernel oil. The remaining 30% is derived from petroleum. The rising price and price volatility of palm oil and crude oil combined with environmental concerns have prompted consumer product companies to seek out sustainable alternatives.[3]
Enzymes[edit]
Codexis supplies varying quantities of its enzymes to pharmaceutical companies, from small to moderate quantities while they are optimizing their production processes, to larger quantities during later-stage clinical development and commercial scale drug production.[4] Codexis also provides enzyme optimization services. [5]
Customers can send Codexis their materials to test against Codexis’ existing libraries of enzymes. If Codexis detects desired activity in a specific enzyme, it can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform optimization services to improve the performance of the enzyme. [6]
History[edit]
Codexis is based in Redwood City, CA and was incorporated in 2002. The company went public in April 2010 on NASDAQ.
Codexis won the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2006 for its work on a building block of Lipitor [7] and a second time with Merck in 2010 for its work on the active ingredient in Januvia.[8]

Technology[edit]
Codexis engineers custom enzymes and microorganisms, which are sometimes referred to as biocatalysts. Codexis' proprietary technology called CodeEvolver is directed evolution technology based on the concept that natural genetic mutation and selection can be accelerated in the research laboratory to obtain specific improvements in the function of single proteins and multiprotein pathways. CodeEvolver combines DNA shuffling and bioinformatics with systems biology to create new biocatalysts.
Chemicals[edit]
Codexis is using its work in biofuels to develop sustainable sources for the 2 million ton detergent alcohol market.[2] Detergent alcohols go into household products such as shampoo and conditioner. Approximately 70% of detergent alcohols are derived from palm kernel oil. The remaining 30% is derived from petroleum. The rising price and price volatility of palm oil and crude oil combined with environmental concerns have prompted consumer product companies to seek out sustainable alternatives.[3]
Enzymes[edit]
Codexis supplies varying quantities of its enzymes to pharmaceutical companies, from small to moderate quantities while they are optimizing their production processes, to larger quantities during later-stage clinical development and commercial scale drug production.[4] Codexis also provides enzyme optimization services. [5]
Customers can send Codexis their materials to test against Codexis’ existing libraries of enzymes. If Codexis detects desired activity in a specific enzyme, it can supply the customer with this enzyme or perform optimization services to improve the performance of the enzyme. [6]
History[edit]
Codexis is based in Redwood City, CA and was incorporated in 2002. The company went public in April 2010 on NASDAQ.
Codexis won the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2006 for its work on a building block of Lipitor [7] and a second time with Merck in 2010 for its work on the active ingredient in Januvia.[8]

Codexis, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Affirms Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
May 9 17
Codexis, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company’s total revenues were $7,971,000 against $7,996,000 a year ago. Loss from operations was $7,476,000 against $6,981,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $7,436,000 against $6,963,000 a year ago. Net loss was $7,460,000 against $6,974,000 a year ago. Net loss per share, basic and diluted was $0.18 against $0.17 a year ago. Net loss - Non-GAAP was $5,465,000 against $4,276,000 a year ago. Net loss per share - Non-GAAP, basic and diluted was $0.13 against $0.11 a year ago.

The company is affirming its financial guidance for the year 2017 as total revenues of $50 million to $53 million, which assumes revenues related to the company's third non-exclusive CodeEvolver license agreement, which is expected in the second half of 2017; product sales of $21 million to $23 million, an increase of 37% to 50% over 2016; and gross margin on product sales between 37% and 39%, which is above the 36% in 2016. Revenue guidance assumes the partial recognition of an upfront payment and the achievement of a first milestone related to third CodeEvolver licensing agreement, which the company expects to announce in the second half of 2017. Given the anticipated timing of this agreement, the company expects total revenues to be higher in the second half of 2017 versus the first half of the year, with approximately 40% of the revenues coming in the first half and 60% in the second half.
