Low budget means no sweeping panoramic views to give scale to what took place. Certainly no Saving Private Ryan.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsPathfinders Deserve Better.ByBob SalterTOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon 8 June 2011Format: DVDOh dear me, another case of shooting myself in the foot whilst on the lookout for an unheralded gem. I have nothing against low budget films, some of which are actually a lot better than their big budget brothers. This one is most definitely low budget. The cast seems to have been assembled randomly off the streets just prior to shooting, which the standard of acting all too sadly reflects. Our local odd job man who usually gets to play the widow Twanky in our village panto is a much more accomplished actor than the majority of this lot. The first half of the film is spent in England and consists mostly of lot of light hearted soldier type banter, and an awful lot of unnecessary close ups to highlight any facial blemishes. At last half way through the film our Pathfinders eventually get around to jumping into the Bocage of Normandy just prior to the D Day landings in World War Two. Things then begin to improve marginally as they fight a prepared enemy at close quarters in the night time. The night time shoot is a good way to avoid larger scale expensive filming. It could have been filmed in my Uncle Bert's back garden for all I know!I always try to find the positives in any film, and this one does at least highlight the confusion of fighting at night time where it was hard to tell friend from foe. Funnily enough though the night time scenes are very well lit! Can anyone tell me if it was a full moon on D Day? It also surprisingly has a couple of scenes that are pretty decent. One paratrooper who has made 178 parachute jumps says that each time he jumps he dies for a few moments until he sees the white canopy of his parachute billowing above him, and then feels the joy of rebirth. Rather nicely put I thought, although I would prefer the option of not jumping at all. Another paratrooper is shown in prayer asking God that if it is his lot to be shot and killed, then it happens quickly and without pain. I hoped for a similar end to my misery half way through this film! But these good scenes are not enough to lift this cheap and tacky film out of the mire. A pity because the story of those men who led the way on D Day is good one, deserving of a better film than this one. I am thinking of going into film making myself now, because I think I could make a better film than this one for the cost of my next shopping bill at Lidl. It will be a night time shoot in rustic Wiltshire of course. My Uncle Bert will be shooting and I will write, direct and act in it. Any applications for a starring role will be considered. Pass me the ibuprofen please! Two stars for a couple of decent scenes.Read more22 Comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsWannabe Band of BrothersByPJ RankineVINE VOICEon 3 June 2011Format: DVDThis movie has attracted a lot of attention on IMDB and Facebook where vitriol is directed at people who slate it.  Lets get one thing straight, slating a bad movie is in no way a slight on the heroes who inspired this film, but this is not a good film.  The cast are at best amateurish and its like watching a re-enactment group in action.  According to IMDB this film has one of the biggest outdoor sets ever built in independent film history.  Where?  Most of the film is spent running around hedgerows in the dark with no sense of scale as to where the enemy are during the encounters.  Yes this story may about a previously unreported brave mission but it is not reflected here, Speilberg where are you?Read more0Comment|

It is one of the worst war films I have seen and doesn't do justice to the honour and sacrifice of the men who took part in the operation.It is so bad I stopped the film half way through to write this review, I'm not sure if I've got the courage to start it again!Do not be fooled by the cover, it's rubbish.Read more11 Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsDreadfulByAmazon Customeron 15 October 2011Format: DVDFor once, I did not consult the reveiws on Amazon before buying. All I can do now is echo the sentiments of the other 'one star' reviews. There is nothing good about this film. It is dreadful from start to finish, and my copy of it has now been binned. Avoid it at all costs. I can only blame myself on this one. I would usually do a little research before purchasing, but I bought this one on the strength of the storyline, and the fact that the DVD cover is very similar to 'Band of Brothers' - I made assumptions it was from the same stable. There the similarities end, it is not in the same class.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsPathinders? Pathloosers!BySt. Marcelon 27 September 2011Format: DVDOh dear! Was realy looking forward to this. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible directing, terrible camera work. Uniforms and vehicles were very good, although the Pathfinders did seem to jump a bit 'light' compared to the enourmous amount of kit that the real brit and US paras actualy jumped with. All the night scenes are done in dark woods with a spot light, so gives no impression of a clandestine operation, and no tension at all, even during the final dash accross the open field under fire.Most laughable scene was the 'english' country house. This is obviously a mock tudor new build with double glazing! I guess the whole film was shot in the US, as even the fences round the 'french' fields looked like they came from Bonanza!I wouldn't have minded if it had been a made for TV film, but not a supposed big budget film such as this was advertised. The BBC makes far better films. Avoid!Read more0Comment|
