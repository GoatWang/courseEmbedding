The expenses shown above are estimates. The actual costs may differ from our 
estimated values. 

The proceeds will not be used, fully or in part, to pay salary or make any 
other payments to the Company ’ s sole officer and Director, Mr. Sriphanorm. 

The total estimated expenses related to this offering of $8,769 include: 

- Estimated cost of $3,500 with auditor ’ s fees for the audit of the Financial 
  Statements contained herein 

- $1,500 with bookkeeper ’ s fees to prepare the November 30, 2012 fiscal year 
  end financials contained herein 

- $2,000 for the attorney ’ s opinion letter 

- $19 for the SEC registration fee*. 

- Costs related to EDGAR expenses of $750 and 

- Costs with Transfer Agent and printing of $1,000. 

*The SEC registration fee has been calculated pursuant to sections 6(b), 13(e), 
 or 14(g) of the Securities Act of 1933. The fee is $136.40 per $1,000,000 
 (prorated for amounts less than $1,000,000). It is calculated by multiplying 
 the aggregate offering amount by .0001364 ($136,000 x .0001364 = $18.55). 

In the twelve months after we become effective, in order to meet our reporting 
obligations, we expect to have the following costs: 

- $2,000 with auditor ’ s fees for each review of our Financial Statements for 
  3 forms 10Q ’ s (totalling $6,000) 

- $3,500 for the fiscal year end financials audit. 

- The bookkeeper ’ s fees for each financial statement will be $1,500 (totalling 
  $4,500). 

- Costs related to EDGAR expenses of $1,100 

- $2,500 for the annual XBRL mapping fee. 

As shown on the table above, we intend to allocate proceeds from this offering 
to keep our reporting status with the SEC current. 

Our officer and director has committed to the advancement of funds (up to 
$15,000) for the next twelve months to cover expenses to maintain the reporting 
status current with the SEC. Mr. Sriphanorm is willing to lend the full amount 
of these funds to the Company as the expenses are incurred, if necessary or if 
no other proceeds are available to the Company, regardless of the amount raised 
through this offering. However, there are no binding agreements regarding this 
commitment and there is no guarantee Mr. Sriphanorm will lend the Company any 
funds. The funds expressed in the above verbal commitment, would be in the form 
of a non-secured loan and would have no interest and no fixed repayment date.


Our company has yet to enter the Market and has not developed its products thus 
far. In order to enter into the Market, Fuerte has to successfully implement its
plan of operations, which is dependent on the success of this offering.

We believe that our concept is innovative and we will have the advantage of 
being pioneers in this concept. The Company has no knowledge of any direct 
competitor at this time. However, these statements are solely based on our 
opinion and there is no data or research to support it. 

Our planned product would differ from the existing pieces of luggage with built 
in locks, because it would be an independent Safe connected inside the luggage 
with the option to have it locked even when the luggage is wide open. Because 
the locks for the luggage and for the Safe would not be interconnected, our 
product would give the option to use the same or a different code to unlock the 
safe and the luggage. This feature is especially useful to give some privacy and
security to the main user when sharing the luggage with another person. 

The main innovative feature would be the opening system on the outside of the 
luggage that would allow valuables to be inserted, but restricted from being 
taken out through the outside of the bags.


Company Description
We are a development-stage Company that intends to develop a built in safe with 
a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of 
backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. We plan on generating revenues by 
licensing our intellectual property for Pack Fuerte products


 for luggage 
manufacturing companies, after we successfully develop our prototype(s). 

As of the date of this prospectus, the Company has done some research and 
contacted some safes and lock boxes manufactures. The Company intends to have 
an initial prototype of the product within 120 days after we raise enough funds 
through this offering. Our final prototype(s) is (are) expected to be completed 
within 9 months.

The timeframes described herein are based on the president ’ s prediction only 
and it is not based on any third party professional opinion. 

We plan on developing an initial prototype made of wood, due to its affordable 
cost and availability (easy to find in hardware stores). Our initial prototype 
would be created with available materials found in hardware stores and would 
serve to understand functionality. After that point, we would have better 
understand on how to proceed and how much and what types of materials would be 
needed. 

We believe further research may be necessary and development of our product will
be needed to implement our plan of operations. We plan on conducting a wide 
research on prices and sources of materials and manufactures after we develop 
our prototype(s). Our goal is to have a functional prototype in hand before we 
search for the best manufacturer for large scale, as at that point we would 
understand what is needed. To develop our initial prototype, we intend to 
purchase the materials in hardware stores, because we will not need a large 
amount of materials. 

We plan on conducting the research via internet and phone calls and the 
president would be responsible for the research. 

The Company has begun communications with several Companies that currently 
manufacture lock boxes and safes. We have started initial contacts with 3 
manufactures, on June 11, 2013: 

.  Mexgrand Metal Products Factory, China. We have received replies from Judy, 
   sales manager on June 12, 15 and 16. They claim to be one of the leading safe
   manufactures in China. 

.  World Safe, Thailand. We have received a reply on June 12, 2013 from Mr. 
   Nattapon. 

.  Security Safe Stop, Thailand. We are still waiting for their reply. 

Based on this initial research, done via email communication, by our president, 
and considering his personal knowledge and opinion, we have concluded that 
there is no existing safe or safe box that would be ideal for our use currently 
in the Market. We will need to fully develop our product and for this reason, 
our products, when developed, will be unique. 

We plan on using plastic to produce our safes, due to its resistance, lower 
weight and durability. However, we need to consider factors like: costs and 
availability of materials, the best possible shape for the Safe (round or sharp 
corners, for example), security and safety. 

We intend to develop our prototype and then quote prices in order to find the 
suitable manufacturer for mass production. We believe that, with funds 
available, we can have an advantageous position and more confidence for 
negotiations with suppliers: we can negotiate better prices for payment in 
advance, set up lunch meetings and trips to negotiate in person and hire 
translators which could expand our possibilities for international negotiations 
for suppliers, if necessary. 

Considering our initial research, it appears that China is a cheaper option for 
manufacturing our safes. However, because other factors could significantly 
affect our final costs (transportation, materials, etc), more research could be 
necessary. For the mass production, we may use one of the companies listed 
above or try to find other options, depending on negotiations and costs. 

At this point, without a physical prototype developed, it is hard to estimate 
costs, functionality and our actual needs. It is also crucial to have at least 
one or a few different types of luggage in order to develop our prototype(s). 
Therefore, we believe at this point that further contact with these or other 
manufactures would be unproductive. 

We have not conducted any other research, other than the ones described above, 
and we have not yet contacted any luggage manufacturing company to determine 
whether our product would be marketable to them. The prediction of marketability
and success of our products is based mainly on our president ’ s opinion and 
opinions of people that he spoke to. 

A functional prototype is a fundamental factor for our development and in order 
to have a prototype, we need funds to develop it. If we are unable to find or 
afford a suitable third party developer, our president could try to develop our 
prototype, however, the purchase of baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, 
etc), is essential for measurements and to define the proper placement for our 
product. 

Currently the Company doesn’t have enough funds to develop our prototype(s). 
For these reasons, our main concern as of the date of this prospectus is to 
employ our efforts in this offering in an effort to raise the necessary capital 
through the sale of our common stock.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT`S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This section of this report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are often identified by words like:  Company History  PACK FUERTE, Inc. ("PACK FUERTE", "the Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a development stage company incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 05, 2012. Pack Fuerte, Inc. intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. This safe would be assessable from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside.  We plan on generate revenue licensing our to-be-developed products to luggage manufacturing companies, after our prototype(s) is fully developed.  We expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully implement our plan of operation.  We have registered 6,800,000 of our common stock for sale to the public. Our registration statement became effective on October 4, 2013 and we are in the process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next 12 months. The Company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans, either from the President or from other interested parties. If we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering, the Company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity.  As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status. The Company's sole officer and director, Mr. Sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.  Should the Company fail to raise capital through this offering and Mr. Sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the Company funds to proceed with its plans the Company will have to cease all business activities until such time further funds are raised. As the Company does not currently have enough cash to fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities; if the Company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts. The Company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing. The Company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering. The Company's current debts are to its attorney, and EDGARizer, there is no assurance that any of the Company's creditors would accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts.  Results of Operations  As of August 31, 2016 we had no cash, with liabilities of $46,159, as compared to November 30, 2015, where we had $516 in cash and liabilities of $37,078.  We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $3,764 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $14,148 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2015. During the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 operating expenses totalized $9,597 compared to $20,681 during the nine-month period ended August 31, 2015.  Plan of Operation  Over the next 12 months, provided that we have raised enough funds, our Company expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below. If we do not raise enough cash through this offering, the following plan of operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so.  The expenses referenced herein, including the costs for the materials and equipment, were estimated based on the president's personal expectations and it is not based in any market research or third party professional's opinion. For this reason, there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient to accomplish the objectives listed herein.  Month 1 to 12:  Internet, Office supplies and Telephone costs. Funds to be used for office supplies, internet and telephone bills. The President will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies.  Month 1 to 9:  Development phase. We began on searching for the suitable third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc.), for measurements and placement of our product. The company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developer(s).  We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and retrieve the valuables).  We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage.  We intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product.  We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s).  Month 9 to 10:  Testing phase. After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will conduct the tests.  Month 10 to 12:  Selling phase. After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.  Capital Resources  If the Company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because the Company is a development stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company's common stock would lose all of their investment.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangement  The Company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the funding necessary to carry its business plan. Our President, Bunloet Sriphanorm has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain its business over the next twelve month period, as the expenses are incurred, in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing these agreements. Investors should be aware that Mr. Sriphanorm's undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him and the Company.  Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	August 31, 2016













	NOTE 1

	

	CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on September 5, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of November 30. The Company intends to develop a built-in Safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. This safe would be accessible from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside.  





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.





	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company

	

	s November 30, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended August 31, 2016 and the same period last year are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.






	Basis of presentation



	In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related interim statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions the affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.







	NOTE 2

	

	GOING CONCERN







	The Company

	

	s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company has a working capital deficit of $46,159 and an accumulated deficit of $62,999 and net loss from operations since inception of $62,999. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.  The Company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder

	

	s shares.





	The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company, including Legal, Audit, Transfer Agency and Edgarizing costs (up to $15,000), however, there are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee our officers and directors will lend the Company any funds.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	On September 24, 2012, the Company has issued 1,725,000,000 Founder

	

	s shares for $11,500 cash.

	On August 18, 2014 the Company approved a forward split of 150:1





	As of August 31, 2016, the Company has not granted any stock options and has not recorded any stock-based compensation.





	On August 31, 2016 and on November 30, 2015, the Company had 100,875,000 common shares issued and outstanding.










	NOTE 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS







	As of August 31, 2016 and of November 30, 2015 the Director paid expenses on behalf of the Company of $31,115 and $18,112 respectively.  The advance is interest free and payable on demand.










	NOTE 5 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS







	The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company

	

	s financial statement.












	NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there are no further events to disclose.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT`S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS







	This section of this report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.  Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.  You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report.  These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.






	Company History






	PACK FUERTE, Inc. (

	

	PACK FUERTE

	

	,

	

	the Company

	

	,

	

	we

	

	,

	

	us

	

	or

	

	our

	

	) is a development stage company incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 05, 2012. Pack Fuerte, Inc. intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. This safe would be assessable from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside.





	We plan on generate revenue licensing our to-be-developed products to luggage manufacturing companies, after our prototype(s) is fully developed.





	We expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully implement our plan of operation.


	 


	We have registered 6,800,000 of our common stock for sale to the public.  Our registration statement became effective on October 4, 2013 and we are in the process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next 12 months.  The Company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans, either from the President or from other interested parties. If we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering, the Company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity.





	As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status. The Company

	

	s sole officer and director, Mr. Sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.





	Should the Company fail to raise capital through this offering and Mr. Sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the Company funds to proceed with its plans the Company will have to cease all business activities until such time further funds are raised.  As the Company does not currently have enough cash to fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities; if the Company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts. The Company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing. The Company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering.  The Company

	

	s current debts are to its attorney, and EDGARizer, there is no assurance that any of the Company

	

	s creditors would accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts.

	Results of Operations






	As of August 31, 2016 we had no cash, with liabilities of $46,159, as compared to November 30, 2015, where we had $516 in cash and liabilities of $37,078.





	We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $3,764 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $14,148 in the three-month period ended August 31, 2015. During the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 operating expenses totalized $9,597 compared to $20,681 during the nine-month period ended August 31, 2015.









	Plan of Operation






	Over the next 12 months, provided that we have raised enough funds, our Company expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below. If we do not raise enough cash through this offering, the following plan of operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so.





	The expenses referenced herein, including the costs for the materials and equipment, were estimated based on the president

	

	s personal expectations and it is not based in any market research or third party professional

	

	s opinion. For this reason, there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient to accomplish the objectives listed herein.





	Month 1 to 12:



	Internet, Office supplies and Telephone costs.

	Funds to be used for office supplies, internet and telephone bills. The President will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies.





	Month 1 to 9:



	Development phase.

	We began on searching for the suitable third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc.), for measurements and placement of our product. The company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developer(s).





	We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and retrieve the valuables).





	We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage.





	We intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product.





	We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s).





	Month 9 to 10:



	Testing phase.

	After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will conduct the tests.









	10







	Month 10 to 12:



	Selling phase.  

	After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.









	Capital Resources






	If the Company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because the Company is a development stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company

	

	s common stock would lose all of their investment. 









	Off Balance Sheet Arrangement






	The Company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the funding necessary to carry its business plan.  Our President, Bunloet Sriphanorm has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain its business over the next twelve month period, as the expenses are incurred, in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing these agreements.  Investors should be aware that Mr. Sriphanorm

	

	s undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him and the Company.





	Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.












	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






	As a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10 (f) (1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information  requested by this Item.












	Item 4. Controls and Procedures







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive and financial officer  has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly






	11







	Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective.  





	The material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows:






	1



	.


	           


	Lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.



	 

	The Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.






	2



	.


	           


	 Audit Committee and Financial Expert


	. The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.





	We intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:















	 





	





	 Establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company

	

	s corporate legal counsel.


















	 





	





	 Form an Audit Committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the Board of Directors a formal review process that will among other things, assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently.









	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting






	As reported in our Report on Form 10-K for the annual year ended November 30, 2015, management is aware that there a significant deficiency and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore has concluded that the Company

	

	s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of August 31, 2016. The significant deficiency relates to a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees involvement with general administrative and financial matters.  The material weakness relates to a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.

	 






	There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.



	 


	 








	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION









	Item 1. Legal Proceedings






	The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings, and no such proceedings are known to be contemplated.

	No director, officer, or affiliate of the issuer and no owner of record or beneficiary of more than 5% of the securities of the issuer, or any security holder is a party adverse to the small business issuer or has a material interest adverse to the small business issuer.

CORRESP

filename6.htm

Pack Fuerte, Inc.         April 30, 2013  To:  Pamela Long Assistant Director Re:  Pack Fuerte, Inc. Registration Statement on Form S-1 Filed March 1, 2013 File No. 333-187007  Dear Ms Long: Thank you for your letter dated March 28, 2013. Regarding your comments, please find in the following pages our responses. General   1. Certain disclosures in your prospectus suggest that your proposed business is commensurate in scope with the uncertainty ordinarily associated with a blank-check company. In this regard, we note the following:  · you are a development stage company with no revenues and have received a going concern opinion from your auditor;  · you issue penny stock;  · you have nominal assets consisting only of cash;  · you anticipate that you will need additional funding to implement your business plan, but there appear to be no efforts or current plans for obtaining this funding, and your disclosure focuses only on the amount of funds necessary to remain a reporting company;  · the registration statement contains very general disclosure related to the nature of your business plan; and  · Note 2 to your audited financial statements indicates that you may merge with an operating company.  These facts suggest that you are a blank check company and thus the terms of your offering should comply with Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Please revise this registration statement accordingly. Please see Rule 419 and Securities Act Release No. 6932 (April 13, 1992).  Response:      We anticipate that we will need additional funding to implement your business plan. Accordingly, all our focus at this time is on the success of this offering. We believe that remaining a reporting company could facilitate the process to obtain additional financing if not enough proceeds are obtained by us through this offering; it is our opinion that, being a reporting company, we would have more credibility.  We have also extended our business plan and deleted the indication on note 2 about merging with an operating company. We have disclosed, on page 3:  Pack Fuerte, inc. is not a Blank Check company. We have no plans, arrangements, commitments or understandings to engage in a merger with or acquisition of another company.   2.  Please provide the disclosure required by Item 102 of Regulation S-K regarding the properties owned or leased by the Company, including the principal executive offices.  Response:  We have included the following sentence, on page 6:  The Company does not own or rent any property. Or business office space is provided by our president at no charge.   3. Throughout your prospectus you refer to a "commitment" by Mr. Sriphanorm to lend funds to the Company up to $15,000 over the coming year. Please clarify, in every instance in which this "commitment" is discussed, that there are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and that there is no guarantee Mr. Sriphanorm will lend the Company any funds.  Response:  We have revised the above mentioned statements on pages 7, 19, 43 and 47 to include the following statement:   There are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee Mr. Sriphanorm will lend the Company any funds.   Dealer Prospectus Delivery Obligation, page 5  4.  Please note that per Item 502(b) of Regulation S-K, this section should be on the outside back cover page of the prospectus.  Response:  We have moved this section to page 2.      Prospectus Summary, page 6  5. Please revise to include the complete mailing address and telephone number of your principal executive offices on either the cover page of your prospectus or in the summary section of your prospectus. Please see Item 503 of Regulation S-K.  Response:  We have included the following, on page 6:  Our business office is located at 99 Village no. 12, Khok Kruad Sub-District, Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima District Nakhon Ratchasima Province, 30280 Thailand; our telephone number is (702)331-8633 and our fax number is (702) 446-8233. Our United States and registered statutory office is located at 2360 Corporate Circle, Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada, 89074, telephone number (702) 866-2500.   General Information About Pack Fuerte, Inc., page 6  6. We note your statement that " [you] plan on generating revenue towards licensing with [y]our concept for Pack Fuerte products for luggage manufacturing companies, after we successfully develop our prototype(s)," in this section and again on pages 26 and 27. Please revise to clarify the meaning of this disclosure. For example, if you intend to generate revenues by licensing your intellectual property to luggage manufacturing companies after you successfully develop prototypes, as suggested on page 8, please disclose this in a clear manner.  Response:  We have revised our disclosures on pages 5, 26 and 27 to state that: We plan on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property for Pack Fuerte products for luggage manufacturing companies, after we successfully develop our prototype(s).  Being an Emerging Growth Company, page 8  7. We note your disclosure on page 8 that you are exempt from say on pay, say on frequency and say on golden parachute payments under Section 14A(e) of the Exchange Act. However, the disclosure that appears on page 10, that you may be entitled to exemptions under Section 14(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, appears to be in error. In this regard, we note disclosure elsewhere that you intend to register the common stock under the Securities Exchange Act. Please advise or revise.  Response:     We have removed the exemptions under Section 14(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from page 9 and we have included the following in the same page:  The Company intends to file, in a period up to 90 days after the termination of this offering, a Form 8A making the Company a mandatory reporting issuer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as Amended.  The Offering, page 10  8. Please disclose how the Company will announce an extension of the offering for an additional 90 days, if it chooses to do so.  Response:  We have revised the page 3; the table on page 10 and the page 21, to state that:  We intend to file an amended S-1 to announce the 90 days extension, if that is the case.  Risk Factors, page 12  9. Please include a discussion of the risks that investors face if less than 25% of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold. In this regard, we note disclosure that you believe you will need proceeds from the sale of at least 25 % of the shares offered in order to implement your plan of operation and file SEC reports.  Response:  We have added the following risk factor starting on page 11:  If less than 25% of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold, we will need further investments in order to develop our business We believe we will need proceeds from the sale of at least 25 % of the shares offered in order to implement your plan of operation and file SEC reports. If less than 25% of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold, we will need further funding in order to develop our business.   There are no guarantees that we will be able to sell enough shares or that we will find other source of funding for our operations. Investors are at risk of losing all their investment.   Risks Related to this Offering, page 13  10. Please include a discussion of the risks surrounding Mr. Sriphanorm 's ability, as the company's sole employee in this self-underwritten offering, to market and consummate sales of the securities offered, in light of his location in Khok Kruat, the limited amount     of time available to administer this offering, and if true, his lack of experience in raising funds in a public offering.   Response:  We have added the following risk factor on page 12:  This is a self-underwritten offering and our sole employee has limited time available and no prior experience in raising funds in a public offering Mr. Sriphanorm, our sole officer and director, lives in Thailand and currently devotes about 10 hours per week to Pack Fuerte, Inc. He is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required, but there are no guarantees he will be able to. Also, he has no proven ability to market and consummate sales of the securities offered herein, as he had no prior experience in raising funds in a public offering.   11. Please include a discussion of how the lack of cumulative voting rights concentrates power in the hands of a majority shareholder under the heading "Since our company's sole officer and director currently owns 100% of the outstanding common stock, investors may find that his decisions are contrary to their interests."  Response:  We have added, on page 13, the following as the first paragraph in the risk factor mentioned above:   The lack of cumulative voting rights concentrates power in the hands of a majority shareholder and in conjunction with Nevada's control share law and business combination law, it may prevent transactions that are in the best interests of investors.   12. Please include a discussion of the risk that the lack of cumulative voting rights, in conjunction with Nevada's control share law and business combination law, may prevent transactions that are in the best interests of investors. This may be combined with the discussion called for in comment 11 above.  Response:  We have combined the response for this comment with the response to comment 11.   Risks Associated with Management and Control Persons, page 15      13. Under an appropriate subheading in this section, please include a discussion of the risks posed by Mr. Sriphanorm ' s lack of experience as an executive officer, as the head of a public company or any company, as a director, or in the luggage or safe industries.  Response:  We have added the following risk factor on page 15:  Our sole officer and director has no prior experience managing our line of Business or as the head of any company Mr. Sriphanorm, our sole officer and director has no prior experience as an executive officer, as the head of a public company or any company, as a director, or in the luggage or safe industries. His inexperience may affect our Business negatively.   Our Company may not be able to establish and maintain disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial reporting, page 16  14. The possibility that enforcing American legal rights against Mr. Sriphanorm may be difficult due to his residence in Khok Kruat appears to be distinct from risks related to disclosure and internal controls. Please place the second paragraph under this heading under a separate, appropriately titled heading.  Response:  We have separated the second paragraph of the above mentioned risk factor and added a new heading on page 15:  Because our sole officer and director resides abroad, shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under United States securities laws Since our sole officer and director resides in Nakhon Ratchasima,Thailand, shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under United States securities laws. Therefore, if any event which would request his personal presence in the United States, including judgment or legal matters concerning him for instance, it may be difficult to get him at the needed time. This may lead to delays, unforeseen situations and lack of investors trust in our sole officer and director. Such matters could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business. However, Mr. Sriphanorm is willing to adjust his timetable to devote more time to the companys business and accommodate with travel, if the business requires to.   If we are unable to succeed in marketing, establishing partnerships or develop [sic] our products, we will not be able to achieve profitable operations, and our business may fail, page 17     15. We note your statement, in both the heading and discussion of this risk factor, that failure to enter into partnerships may cause your business to fail. This would seem to imply that you intend to seek out partnerships to enter. However, you state on pages 6 and 26 that you have no plans to partner with another business. Please revise as appropriate.  Response:  We have revised the following risk factor starting on page 16:  If we are unable to succeed in marketing or developing our products, we will not be able to achieve profitable operations, and our business may fail.  If we are unable to succeed in marketing or developing our products, we will be unable to achieve profitable operations. Any time new products are introduced into a market, there is a substantial risk that revenue will not meet expectations or even cover the cost of operations. While we anticipate the ability to attract clients, there is no way to predict the volume that will occur or even if it will be sufficient enough to support our future operations. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of our business. These factors include, but are not limited to, consumer demand and emerging competition. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but it is possible they may result in our not receiving an adequate return on our invested capital. We have limited experience in marketing products, and we may experience development or manufacturing problems which could increase our losses.   Existing and future laws or regulations can affect our business and we may not have the ability to comply with these laws or regulations, page 17  16. Please revise this risk factor to better describe the risk that future law and regulation could impact you adversely, given the specific types of activities you plan to engage in. Please also revise the first paragraph under this heading to better identify the "industry" whose growth you are referring to, and revise to clarify the meaning of the final two sentences in this paragraph.  Response:  We have revised the risk factor on page 17:  Existing and future laws or regulations can affect our business and we may not have the ability to comply with these laws or regulations.    Changes to laws and regulations are often unpredictable and out of anyones control.  Governments can adopt and enforce new and stricter regulations  which could ultimately vary from state to state and country to country. Our Company could be affected by new regulations towards our line of business. Depending on the regulation, there is a possibility of us having to reformat all of the existing structure of the product at that time.  Without an established business and enough capital to comply with such regulations, we could lose operations as a result.    17. The second and third paragraphs under this heading appear to address risks unrelated to the effect of laws or regulations on your business. Please revise to present them under appropriately-titled headings.  Response:  We have added new headings for the second and third paragraphs of the above mentioned risk factor on page 17:  Our dependency on third party professionals may be adverse to our results Our dependence on hiring the appropriate third parties to perform essential services could result in material adverse effects on the companys potential future operations as well as, with the companys business including operating results and financial condition. Further, such third party contractors have no fiduciary duty to our shareholders and may not perform these services as expected. The capacity of certain third parties for these services may be limited for economic or other reasons.    We depend on additional capital to implement our Business and generate revenue The Company is presenting this offering in order to raise capital. The company will fail if funds cannot be raised in this offering or by loans from other interested parties. If we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering, the Company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity.   Plan of Distribution, page 21  18. Please revise the second to last paragraph under this heading to clarify what rules and regulations under the Exchange Act you are referring to.  Response:                  We have revised the above mentioned paragraph on page 21: Our Common Stock is currently considered a "penny stock" under federal securities laws (Securities Exchange Act Section 3a (51(A)) since its market price is below $5.00 per share. Penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers (Penny Stock Reform Act) who sell or recommend such shares to certain investors.  Information with Respect to Registrant, page 26  19. Your disclosure in the first paragraph under this heading states that on November 26, 2012, Mr. Peralta resigned as sole officer and director of Pack Fuerte, Inc. and Mr. Sriphanorm was appointed sole officer and director. We note that the 11,500,000 shares currently owned by Mr. Sriphanorm were issued to Mr. Peralta. Please disclose the manner in which ownership of the Company was transferred. See Item 101(a)(1), which calls for disclosure of major corporate events.  Response:  We have added the paragraph below on pages 5, 26, 52 and 55:  Initially, Mr. Sriphanorm was expected to become a member of the board. Mr. Peralta was unable to fulfill his fiduciary duties as president and CEO due to personal reasons; therefore, Mr. Sriphanorm purchased the 11,500,000 shares (initially issued to Mr. Peralta) at par value in a private transaction.  Market Opportunity, page 26  20. Please clarify the second and third paragraphs under this heading. Specifically, please clarify the language in the parenthetical in the second paragraph and substantiate the assertions made in the third paragraph.  Response:  We have revised the above mentioned paragraphs on page 26 and 27:  People who travel may often have visitors in their hotel room or may be traveling with an unreliable companion (eg. friends, minor children, teenagers and/or family members). These people could have access to wallets, passports, or other valuable possessions. Some people can take cash or credit cards from friends/parents wallets without consent and there is always the risk of robbery from the housekeeping while the guest is absent). Tourists are also a target for pick-pocketing. It is our opinion that our to-be-developed product would substantially increase the security against petty thefts. We also believe that the concept for our security product is innovative and it could be of great interest for the general public because of its security and convenience. For these reasons, our opinion is that it could be excellent for the manufacturer to     have our security products installed in their products; therefore, offering a new line of novelty products could increase their sales.   Description of Our Services, page 27  21. Please clarify your description of your to-be-developed safe. It is unclear how it differs from the standard pieces of luggage with built-in locks that you refer to in the fifth bullet point under this heading. Please also address what distinguishes your product on page 28 under "Competitive Advantages."  Response:  We have added the 2 paragraphs below on pages 27:  Our planned product would differ from the existing pieces of luggage with built in locks, because it would be an independent Safe connected inside the luggage with the option to have it locked even when the luggage is wide open. Because the locks for the luggage and for the Safe would not be interconnected, our product would give the option to use the same or a different code to unlock the safe and the luggage. This feature is especially useful to give some privacy and security to the main user when sharing the luggage with another person. The main innovative feature would be the opening system on the outside of the luggage that would allow valuables to be inserted, but restricted from being taken out through the outside of the bags.  We have also included the below paragraph on page 29: Our brochures would have all the specs of our product and a simulated cost of implementation for our clients. Our president would hire someone to develop our brochure and if no funds are available at the time, he would try and develop our brochures himself.   Intellectual Property, page 28  22. We note that your business proposes to generate revenue through licensing arrangements. However, neither here nor in your Plan of Operation do you discuss measures you will take to protect the intellectual property you propose licensing or account for the costs of acquiring defensible intellectual property rights. Please revise this section thoroughly, or add a discussion under Risk Factors relating to the fact that your source of revenue may be intellectual property, that is not subject to copyright, trademark or patent protection, that you have no plans to secure protections for your intellectual property, and have made no provisions for the costs of securing such protections. In addition, if you plan to include non-disclosure and non-competition     provisions in any license agreement that you would enter into, please discuss that here, as well as any limitations or shortcomings of those types of provisions.  Response:  We have included the following statement on page 29: We plan on using part of our proceeds from our Development phase to secure the intellectual property of our products (see Plan of Operations for more details).  Employees and Employment Agreements, page 29  23. You state that Mr. Sriphanorm is employed elsewhere. Please disclose, if true, that this is a reference to his being self-employed, as stated on page 45. We also note that Mr. Srinaphanorm "has flexibility to work on Pack Fuerte up to 10 hours per week"; however, the following sentence states that he is prepared to devote more time to your operations as may be required. Please reconcile these mutually contradictory statements.  Response:  We have revised the above mentioned paragraph starting on page 29:  As the date of this prospectus, Pack Fuerte has no permanent staff other than its sole officer and director, Mr. Bunloet Sriphanorm, who is the President and Chairman of the Company. Mr. Sriphanorm is self-employed and currently works on Pack Fuerte about 10 hours per week. He is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required. He is not being paid at present.   Reports to Security Holders, page 30  24. We note your disclosure that you will not be required to furnish an annual report to shareholders. You also state that you intend to file a Form 8-A under the Exchange Act, which registers a class of securities thereunder. Note that when you register a class of securities under the Exchange Act, you will become subject to the proxy rules, including the requirement to deliver an annual report to security holders. Please revise your disclosure to better describe your obligations in this regard.  Response:  We have revised our disclosure on page 30:  After we complete this offering, we will be required to file reports with the SEC under section 13 (a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (supplementary and periodic information for an issuer which shall file a registration statement which has become effective pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such     rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors). The reports will be filed electronically. The reports we will be required to file are Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. You may read copies of any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room or visiting the SECs Internet website (see Available Information above). The Company intends to file, in a period up to 90 days after the termination of this offering, a Form 8A making the Company a mandatory reporting issuer under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as Amended.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 41  Plan of Operation, page 41  25. Please elaborate on the steps you plan to take in each of the three phases you list here. For example, in the development stage, please explain what is involved in "developing" the product, and why you need to hire a third party to do this. In the testing phase, explain what type of testing you plan to do, and again, why you would need to hire a third party to conduct testing.  Response:  We have elaborated the steps of our Plan of Operation, starting on page 43:  Month 1 to 9:  Development phase. We plan on searching for the suitable third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc), for measurements and placement of our product. The company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developer(s).  Developing our product consists in measuring and analyzing existing baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc) to figure out the best way to have our product in it without compromising excessive space, weight and the look of each product. At this time, we plan on having it installed on the inside back part of the baggage. Possibly we may use plastic or aluminum, due to its resistance, lower weight and durability. However, we need to consider factors like: security check points in airports (no metal), the best possible shape for the Safe (round or sharp corners, for example). We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and retrieve the valuables). The best way to have the doors placed and working will also need developed. We would analyze the best possibility for the openings considering the width and height, the way it would open, close and lock, without compromise too much of space.  We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering the material chosen and also the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage.    We intend to develop third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product. Wed look for someone with knowledge on different materials costs, weight and resistance.  We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s). Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, wed have $16,443.10 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, wed only have $5,343.80.  With a higher amount to be invested, wed be able to hire a third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product with higher qualifications and experience. Wed be able to buy better/new materials and hire attorneys to secure our intellectual property. With a lower amount to be invested, wed only be able to hire a third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product with lower qualifications and little or no experience. We could also have to negotiate a compensation based on our licensing results, if we cannot pay for their services at that time. However, there are no guarantees that this would be accepted by the developers. Wed have to buy cheaper/used materials and hire an attorney to advise us on the process to secure our intellectual property.  Also, with more funds to be used in this phase, we could develop more types of prototypes for different types of luggage. With limited funds, wed have to focus on only one type of luggage.           Planed use of proceeds for Development Phase   100% of shares sold  75% of shares sold  50% of shares sold  25% of shares sold   Purchase of baggage and materials  $26,743.80  $17,943.80  $9,143.80  $1,343.80   Third party contractors  $35,000.00  $25,000.00  $15,000.00  $2,500.00   Intellectual property  $15,000.00  $10,000.00  $5,000.00  $1,500.00    Month 9 to 10:     Testing phase. After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will conduct the tests. The tests are necessary to assure quality and functionality of our final product. We plan on having the specs on size, temperature resistance, security and resistance of the Safe and locks, including shock absorption. Also important would be the final test with the end user (we would use a certain number of people to try our product). We would need to test our product under hard circumstances (dropping it, hammering it, trying to break in, etc.), but more importantly, we are willing to consider the end user feedback and adjust our product to assure the highest quality possible. We believe that the use of third party testing companies would be cost efficient, as it would be done in a faster and more objective, non-biased way. It is our opinion that having results from a third party would give us more credibility. Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, wed have $10,962.40 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, wed only have $762.40.  With a higher amount to be invested, wed be able to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests on our prototype(s). With a lower amount to be invested, wed have to rely on acquaintances for low or no compensation and the president would be responsible for conducting all the tests.          Planed use of proceeds for Testing Phase   100% of shares sold  75% of shares sold  50% of shares sold  25% of shares sold   Hire third party testing companies   $10,963.40  $7,563.40  $4,163.40  $763.40     Month 10 to 12: Selling phase.  After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.    Our brochures would have all the specs of our product and a simulated cost of implementation for our clients. Our president would hire someone to develop our brochure and if no funds are available at the time, he would try and develop our brochures himself. Depending on the funds acquired through this offering (according to the percentage of shares sold), some compromises may be needed. If we can sell all shares offered herein, wed have $10,962.40 to invest and if we can only sell 25% of the shares offered herein, wed only have $1,143.10.  With a higher amount to be invested, wed be able to hire professional photographers and hire a third party company to help us finding possible clients. Wed also be able to reach a bigger number of prospected clients. With a lower amount to be invested, wed have to take our own photos of our products and wed have to search for baggage manufactures with no help from professionals. Wed be able to reach a smaller number of prospected clients.  The Companys president will be responsible for all negotiations.           Planed use of proceeds for Selling Phase   100% of shares sold  75% of shares sold  50% of shares sold  25% of shares sold   Search for baggage manufacture companies  $11,445.10  $8,345.10  $4,245.10  $645.10   Photos and brochure development  $5,000.00  $3,000.00  $2,000.00  $500.00     26. As funding is critical to your ability to complete the phases of your plan of operation, please discuss what you would expect to do if you do not raise sufficient funds, including the likelihood that you would enter into a sale of the company, an acquisition of another business or other business combination.  Response:  We have inserted the 2 paragraphs below on page 46:  Because funding is critical to our ability to complete the phases of our plan of operation, in the case we are not able to raise enough funds through this offering, we would have to focus     on finding another source of funds, possibly try to raise equity financing. However, being a development stage Company with no revenues to date, it could be very difficult.   We have no plans to enter into a sale of the company, an acquisition of another business or other business combination.   Capital Resources and Liquidity, page 44  27. Please disclose the amount of funds you believe you need in order to complete all three phases of your plan of operations and thereby become operational. We note that you believe that 25% of the offering amount must be raised in order to maintain your reporting status for 12 months. We also note that you have an understanding with Mr. Sriphanonn that he will contribute up to $15,000 for this purpose. However, this does not address what funds will be necessary before the company can begin generating revenue.  Response:  We have revised our prospectus to add the information below on page 46 and 47:  We believe that we could possibly start generating revenue with the sale of at least 25% of the shares offered herein; however, we would have to compromise our Plan of Operations.  We would depend on the acceptance from the third party developers to have a compensation based on our future licensing results and we would have to focus on only one type of luggage.  28. Please clarify whether, even if your offering is fully subscribed, you will need to raise additional funds to complete all three phases of your plan of operation. For example, we note your disclosure that "[ m ]anagement believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof', which suggests that you may already believe that subsequent private placements will be necessary in order to become operational, regardless of the amount of proceeds raised in the offering.  Response:  We have revised the above mentioned paragraph on page 47:  Management believes that if we are able to raise enough funds through this offering or, if we are not able to sell enough shares and subsequent private placements are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof.       29. Clearly discuss what other sources of liquidity you would likely pursue if the offering does not provide the amount of proceeds you need to become operational. Also discuss any limitations on your ability to actually obtain liquidity from such other sources.  Response:  We have revised the paragraph below on page 47:  If this offering does not provide the amount of proceeds we need to become operational, we would have to focus on finding another source of funds; possibly try to raise equity financing. However, being a development stage Company with no revenues to date, additional equity financing could not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we would fail to satisfy our future cash requirements; we would be unable to develop our product and generate revenue.    Directors and Executive Officers, page 45  Identification of Directors and Executive Officers, page 45  30. Please revise to note that while you currently have one director, your by-laws as drafted require a Board composed of four directors.  Response:  As drafted, the last sentence from the Article II (2) from our Bylaws, states that: Unless otherwise fixed by the directors, the number of directors constituting the entire Board shall be four.  We have included, as an amendment, the Resolution of the Board of Directors amending the item 2 of the Article II of our Bylaws, the number of directors constituting the entire Board shall be one.    31. Please disclose the fact that Mr. Sriphanonn, the sole member of your Audit Committee, is not independent, and the applicable standard for independence. See Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K.  Response:  We have disclosed, on page 48:  Mr. Sriphanorm is the sole member of our Audit Committee; therefore he is not independent of the Company. However, Mr. Sriphanorm is not related to any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system. He is not being paid by the Company as of the date     of this prospectus and is not expected to be paid until the Company becomes profitable. No compensation has been and will not be given to him until the Company is profitable.   32. Please correct the statement that Mr. Sriphanonn has held his office and directorship since the inception of the Company. Disclosure elsewhere in the prospectus indicates that Mr. Peralta held Mr. Sriphanorm's office and directorship at the inception of the company.  Response:  We have corrected the statement on page 49:  The person named above has held his offices/positions since November 26, 2012 and is expected to hold his offices/positions at least until the next annual meeting of our stockholders.  Business Experience, page 45  33. Please expand the description of Mr. Sriphanonn's background to highlight his relevant experience and level of professional competence. Refer to Item 401 (e)(1) of Regulation S-K. Disclosure that indicates Mr. Sriphanorm's knowledge about the Company's business and industry are particularly helpful in understanding his qualifications to serve as the Company's sole officer and director.  Response:  We have expanded the description of Mr. Sriphanorms background on page 49:  We believe Mr. Sriphanorm is competent to act as our president because of his self-employment experience and his understanding on how to deal with contractors. Due to his experience in searching for and buying auto body parts, we believe he will be able to purchase all the necessary materials for us and give his professional direction on building the products. Mr. Sriphanorm has a personal interest in developing our products, as he was a victim of petty theft.  Executive Compensation, page 46  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management, page 48  34. We note footnote one to the table presented under this heading. As no person is named above that footnote, please clarify to whom or what the footnote pertains. Please also elaborate on your statement that Mr. Sriphanonn is the only "promoter" of your company. Please disclose why Mr. Sriphanonn may be considered a promoter, and please supplementally provide us with an analysis of whether Mr. Peralta may be considered a promoter     Response:  We have capitalized Mr. Bunloet Sriphanorms name in the table on page 51 and revised the footnote on page 52:  [1] The person named in the above table may be deemed to be a promoter of our Company because acting alone, directly or indirectly he may take initiative in founding and organizing our business or enterprise. However, he did not and will not directly or indirectly receive in consideration of services or property, or both services and property, 10 percent or more of any class of securities of the Company or 10 percent or more of the proceeds from the sale of any class of such securities. Mr. Sriphanorm is the only promoter of our Company and Mr. Peralta has not been and will not be a promoter of Pack Fuerte, Inc.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, page 49  35. Please discuss the $1,004 loan to the Company made by Mr. Sriphanonn under this heading, or supplementally provide your analysis of why a discussion of this loan is unnecessary. Note that smaller reporting companies must discuss related party transactions where the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of the company's total assets at year end for the last two fiscal years. Please see Items 404(a)(5) and 404(d)(1) of Regulation S-K.  Response:  We have disclosed, on page 52:  The $1,004 loan to the Company made by Mr. Sriphanorm consists of costs with Website domain and email services ($43); Incorporation costs ($636) and costs with Documentation with Secretary of State ($325). This is a non-secured loan and it has no interest and no fixed repayment date  36. We note that you have identified Mr. Sriphanonn as a promoter in the note to your beneficial ownership table. Please discuss the nature and amount of anything of value received or to be received by him, and the nature and amount of any assets, services or other consideration that he provided to the company, as required by Item 404( c) of Regulation S-K. Please also tell us, with a view toward disclosure, whether Mr. Peralta may be considered to have been a promoter at any time during the last five years. If so, provide similar disclosures under Item 404(c) with respect to Mr. Peralta.  Response:  We have added the 3 paragraphs below  starting on page 52: Other than the loan described on the paragraph above, there is nothing of value received or to be received by Mr. Sriphanorm,  including no amount of any assets, services or other consideration that he provided to the company.     Mr. Peralta, our Companys former president, has not been and will not be a promoter of Pack Fuerte, Inc. Further, there is nothing of value received or to be received by Mr. Peralta, including no amount of any assets, services or other consideration that he may have provided to the company. Mr. Sriphanorm is committed to provide funds (up to $15,000 for the next 12 months) to meet our report obligations. There are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee Mr. Sriphanorm will lend the Company any funds.   Signatures, page 54  1. Please provide the date for the second signature on this page. See Form S-l.  Response:  We have provided the date for the second signature on page 58.

Company History
PACK FUERTE, Inc. ("PACK FUERTE", "the Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a
development stage company incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 05,
2012. Pack Fuerte, Inc. intends to develop a built in safe with a combination
lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks,
carry-on luggage and suitcases. This safe would be assessable from the outside
of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only
recoverable from the inside.
We plan on generate revenue licensing our to-be-developed products to luggage
manufacturing companies, after our prototype(s) is fully developed.
We expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully
implement our plan of operation.
We have registered 6,800,000 of our common stock for sale to the public.  Our
registration statement became effective on October 4, 2013 and we are in the
process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next 12
months.  The Company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering
or by loans, either from the President or from other interested parties. If we
are unable to raise enough funds through this offering, the Company would have
to seek additional capital through debt or equity.
As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will
not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status. The Company's
sole officer and director, Mr. Sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required
to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next
twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by
the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement
securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its
reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards
the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its
entirety.
Should the Company fail to raise capital through this offering and Mr.
Sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the Company funds to proceed with its
plans the Company will have to cease all business activities until such time
further funds are raised.  As the Company does not currently have enough cash to
fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities; if
the Company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue
restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts. The Company
would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity
financing. The Company would not settle any related party debt with this type of
share offering.  The Company's current debts are to its attorney,



                                       9


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and EDGARizer, there is no assurance that any of the Company's creditors would
accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts.
Results of Operations
As of February 29, 2016 we had $516 in cash, with liabilities of $40,411, as
compared to November 30, 2015, where we had $516 in cash and liabilities of
$37,078.
We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $3,333 in the three-month period
ended February 29, 2016 as compared to $2,300 in the three-month period ended
February 28, 2015.




Plan of Operation



Over the next 12 months, provided that we have raised enough funds, our Company
expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below.
If we do not raise enough cash through this offering, the following plan of
operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so.
The expenses referenced herein, including the costs for the materials and
equipment, were estimated based on the president's personal expectations and it
is not based in any market research or third party professional's opinion. For
this reason, there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient
to accomplish the objectives listed herein.
Month 1 to 12:
Internet, Office supplies and Telephone costs. Funds to be used for office
supplies, internet and telephone bills. The President will be responsible to pay
the bills and to purchase office supplies.
Month 1 to 9:
Development phase. We began on searching for the suitable third party Company or
individual(s) to develop our product. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs,
suitcases, luggage, etc.), for measurements and placement of our product. The
company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third
party developer(s).
We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which
would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and
retrieve the valuables).
We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering
the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final
appearance of the luggage.
We intend to search for third party professional developers because they would
be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final
product.
We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this
phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s).








                                       10


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Month 9 to 10:
Testing phase. After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied
circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if
finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the
third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will
conduct the tests.



Month 10 to 12:


Selling phase.  After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend
to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to
license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will
be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and
email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.



Capital Resources


If the Company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a
private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through
debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage
company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success
of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result
in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing,
which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were
available, because the Company is a development stage company with no operations
to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk
loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds
are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and
determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage
the debt load. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private
placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to
cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company's common stock
would lose all of their investment.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangement
The Company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the
funding necessary to carry its business plan.  Our President, Bunloet Sriphanorm
has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain its
business over the next twelve month period, as the expenses are incurred, in the
form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written
agreement securing these agreements.  Investors should be aware that Mr.
Sriphanorm's undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him
and the Company.
Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	May 31, 2016













	NOTE 1

	

	CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on September 5, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of November 30. The Company intends to develop a built-in Safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items, inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage and suitcases. This safe would be accessible from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside.  





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.





	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company

	

	s November 30, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended May 31, 2016 and the same period last year are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.






	Basis of presentation



	In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related interim statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions the affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.







	NOTE 2

	

	GOING CONCERN







	The Company

	

	s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company has a working capital deficit of $42,395 and an accumulated deficit of $59,235 and net loss from operations since inception of $59,235. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.  The Company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder

	

	s shares.





	The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company, including Legal, Audit, Transfer Agency and Edgarizing costs (up to $15,000), however, there are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee our officers and directors will lend the Company any funds.

	

	s financial statement.












	NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT`S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS







	This section of this report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.  Forward looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions or words which, by their nature, refer to future events.  You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report.  These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.

	We plan on generate revenue licensing our to-be-developed products to luggage manufacturing companies, after our prototype(s) is fully developed.





	We expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully implement our plan of operation.


	 


	We have registered 6,800,000 of our common stock for sale to the public.  Our registration statement became effective on October 4, 2013 and we are in the process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next 12 months.  The Company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans, either from the President or from other interested parties. If we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering, the Company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity.





	As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status. The Company

	

	s sole officer and director, Mr. Sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the Company. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes if the Company cannot maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.





	Should the Company fail to raise capital through this offering and Mr. Sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the Company funds to proceed with its plans the Company will have to cease all business activities until such time further funds are raised.  As the Company does not currently have enough cash to fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities; if the Company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts. The Company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing. The Company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering.  The Company

	

	s current debts are to its attorney, and EDGARizer, there is no assurance that any of the Company

	

	s creditors would accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts.

	Results of Operations






	As of May 31, 2016 we had $516 in cash, with liabilities of $42,911, as compared to November 30, 2015, where we had $516 in cash and liabilities of $37,078.





	We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $5,833 in the six-month period ended May 31, 2016 as compared to $6,533 in the six-month period ended May 31, 2015. During the three-month period ended May 31, 2016 operating expenses totalized $2,500 compared to $4,233 during the three-month period ended May 31, 2015.









	Plan of Operation






	Over the next 12 months, provided that we have raised enough funds, our Company expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below. If we do not raise enough cash through this offering, the following plan of operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so.





	The expenses referenced herein, including the costs for the materials and equipment, were estimated based on the president

	

	s personal expectations and it is not based in any market research or third party professional

	

	s opinion. For this reason, there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient to accomplish the objectives listed herein.





	Month 1 to 12:



	Internet, Office supplies and Telephone costs.

	Funds to be used for office supplies, internet and telephone bills. The President will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies.





	Month 1 to 9:



	Development phase.

	We began on searching for the suitable third party Company or individual(s) to develop our product. We intend to purchase baggage (back packs, suitcases, luggage, etc.), for measurements and placement of our product. The company's president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developer(s).





	We would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door (which would allow to insert the valuables) and for the inside door (to open and retrieve the valuables).





	We would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls, considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage.





	We intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product.





	We also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our product(s).

	Month 9 to 10:



	Testing phase.

	After our product is developed, we plan on testing it in varied circumstances. We intend to hire a third party Company to conduct the tests, if finances allow. The company's president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process. If necessary, he will conduct the tests.





	Month 10 to 12:



	Selling phase.  

	After we have fully developed and tested our products, we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products. We intend to license it for 15% in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products, but it will be dependent on negotiations. We intend to acquire photos of our products and email, mail and fax it to prospected buyers.









	Capital Resources






	If the Company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the Company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because the Company is a development stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company

	

	s common stock would lose all of their investment. 









	Off Balance Sheet Arrangement






	The Company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the funding necessary to carry its business plan.  Our President, Bunloet Sriphanorm has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain its business over the next twelve month period, as the expenses are incurred, in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing these agreements.  Investors should be aware that Mr. Sriphanorm

	

	s undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him and the Company.





	Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk






	As a Smaller Reporting Company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10 (f) (1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information  requested by this Item.












	Item 4. Controls and Procedures







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive and financial officer  has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective.  





	The material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows:






	1



	.


	           


	Lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.



	 

	The Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.






	2



	.


	           


	 Audit Committee and Financial Expert


	. The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.





	We intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:















	 





	





	 Establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company

	

	s corporate legal counsel.


















	 





	





	 Form an Audit Committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the Board of Directors a formal review process that will among other things, assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently.









	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting






	As reported in our Report on Form 10-K for the annual year ended November 30, 2015, management is aware that there a significant deficiency and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore has concluded that the Company

	

	s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May 31, 2016. The significant deficiency relates to a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees involvement with general administrative and financial matters.  The material weakness relates to a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions.

	 










	12







	There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended May 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
