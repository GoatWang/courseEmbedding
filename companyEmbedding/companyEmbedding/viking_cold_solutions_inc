Viking Cold Solutions, Inc. Key Developments

Viking Cold Solutions Announces Launch of Solar Energy Storage
Aug 31 16
Viking Cold Solutions announced the launch of Solar Energy Storage at the Refrigerated Warehouse and Transportation Association Conference in Queensland, Australia. The system combines Viking Cold's patented Thermal Energy Storage System with rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) to deliver green, cost-effective, around-the-clock energy management for cold storage facilities, supermarkets, and utilities. The system can reduce electricity peak demand by up to 90%, save customers money, and helps balance the electricity grid. The technology enables cold-storage facilities and supermarkets to intelligently store and selectively deploy PV generated power within refrigerators to reduce energy costs. Originally developed by NASA, the patented Thermal Energy Storage Cells are now used to absorb infiltrated heat so that food remains at its target temperature. This environmentally friendly solution solves some of the challenges of solar energy by extending the useful time for solar power and by reducing renewable variability. Viking Cold's Solar Energy Storage solution comes at a key time for Australia. 33% of electricity in South Australia is generated from renewable sources and it has set an aggressive target of 50% renewable generation by 2025. Renewable generation combined with Viking Cold's Solar Energy Storage provides multiple advantages for both businesses and grid operators: Increase the value of PV " Store solar energy during the day and use it for refrigeration at night. Cost-effectiveness and system longevity " Renewable generation and Viking Cold's Solar Energy Storage are low-cost and are designed to last for at least 20 years with minimal maintenance. Lower peak demand charges " Peak load shedding or shifting on command avoids peak rate times. Reduce operational risk " Thermal backup allows customers to maintain safe temperatures and preserve food quality during equipment failure or power outages, reducing food loss and business interruption. Buffer for Utilities " Utilities benefit from Viking Cold's Solar Energy Storage solution by providing a "buffer" of on-demand, efficient, and environmentally friendly thermal energy storage at customer sites. Economic development " Viking Cold's Solar Energy Storage boosts the local economy by using local engineering and labor. To learn more, watch Viking Cold's 90 second video which explains how the technology works. Viking Cold Solutions is an energy management company focused on making the world's cold storage systems more efficient. Its Thermal Energy Storage Systems have saved their clients over 6000 MWh of energy and have removed over 4,000 metric tons of Carbon from the air and mitigated over $13M of product loss. The Viking Cold team has deep expertise in cold storage energy management, supermarket energy management, and thermal energy storage systems. Viking Cold Solutions provides energy storage solutions that reduce operational costs and business risk for cold storage and supermarkets with high refrigeration-based energy loads. The company is expanding rapidly across the globe.

Viking Cold Thermal Energy Storage System Reduces Frozen Gourmet’s Energy Costs by Over 27%              For businesses in the frozen food market, energy costs are a major expense. Reducing the electricity used in storage facilities directly impacts the bottom line, making it a top priority for owners and operators. Cold storage operators who make the move to an innovative thermal energy storage system will realize significant cost savings, enhanced product monitoring, and protection for low temperature cold storage.
Frozen Gourmet, a dedicated Nestlé facility and a leading ice cream distribution company in California, recently installed a Viking Cold Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system and reduced energy consumption by over 27%.
The patented Viking Cold TES system was installed at the end of 2016, and Frozen Gourmet quickly realized significant energy savings. Since the beginning of 2017, the facility has reduced energy consumption by over 45,000 kWh, a number that continues to grow each month. In addition, the passive TES system stores energy at night for use during the day, shifting more compressor runtime to evening hours. This enables greater efficiency during periods of time with lower ambient temperatures.

Energy bills can be particularly challenging to understand, with few people able to wrap their heads around all the technical elements listed on a monthly statement. But for businesses with operations that consume a great deal of energy, being able to make sense of a utility bill is critical to ensuring expenses stay low.
