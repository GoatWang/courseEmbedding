FDA Clears Vioguard™ Self-Sanitizing Keyboard for Use in U.S. 
      Hospitals and Medical Clinics




First FDA cleared computer keyboard to use germicidal properties of 
      ultraviolet light to destroy harmful viruses and bacteria






January 03, 2012 10:31 AM Eastern Standard Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vioguard™LLC (www.vioguard.com) 
      today announced the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has cleared the 
      company’s first product, the Vioguard self-sanitizing computer keyboard, 
      for use in healthcare settings. The product is the first FDA-cleared 
      computer keyboard to use the germicidal properties of ultraviolet light 
      (UV-C) to automatically clean its surfaces. UV-C is a proven killer of 
      flu, MRSA, and other harmful viruses and germs.
    


      Vioguard’s keyboard was developed specifically to address the need for 
      continual disinfection efforts in the medical workplace. The Vioguard 
      keyboard is the first computer peripheral that directly deals with the 
      issue of cross-contamination among shared workstations, by automatically 
      destroying deadly microorganisms such as MRSA.
    

      According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 
      healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) impact over 1.7 million patients 
      in the U.S. each year. Similar infections are also on the rise in 
      community settings: a CDC prospective study in 2003 suggested that 12% 
      of clinical MRSA infections are community-associated.
    

      “We're very pleased with the FDA clearance, which substantiates our 
      medical claims and allows hospitals and clinics to make use of this new 
      tool,” said Larry Ranta, president and CEO of Vioguard. "Conventional 
      computer keyboards have been identified as a key point of transmission 
      of viruses and bacteria, especially within the medical setting. The 
      Vioguard keyboard takes the guesswork out of sanitization efforts, 
      reduces labor costs, and helps fight the spread of harmful and often 
      deadly superbugs."
    

      Vioguard's FDA clearance is the latest in a series of announcements from 
      the company. A clinical trial proving the keyboard's efficacy was 
      recently published in the American Journal of Infection Control, 
      and Vioguard's patent was awarded in December.
    

About UV-C light:


      Since the early 20th century, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation has 
      been studied and used for the sterilization of microorganisms. Microbes 
      are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of UV light at specific 
      wavelengths that contain just the right amount of energy to break down 
      organic molecular bonds.
    

      Based on independent laboratory testing, Vioguard has shown that the 
      ultraviolet light generated by the keyboard's two 25-watt germicidal 
      fluorescent lamps killed a minimum of 99.99% of harmful bacteria and 
      viruses, including E. coli, MRSA, and other pathogens.
    

How it works:


      Vioguard’s self-sanitizing keyboard has the look and feel of a standard 
      notebook keyboard, and requires no software or special hardware to 
      function. A powerful microprocessor controls UV exposure, operation of 
      the sensor, and monitors safety interlock switches and lamp status.
    

      On a user-triggered or predetermined basis, the keyboard automatically 
      retracts into its own clean, light-tight enclosure. The keyboard is then 
      safely flooded with high power germicidal UV light. By waving a hand 
      within inches of a built-in motion sensor, the motorized keyboard drawer 
      quietly opens and presents a completely sanitized keyboard and touchpad.
    

About Vioguard:


      Vioguard is a company committed to developing innovative products that 
      help organizations stop the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses. 
      Their first product, the Vioguard Self-Sanitizing Keyboard, uses the 
      germicidal properties of ultraviolet light (UV-C) to automatically 
      disinfect the keyboard and touchpad surface after every use.
    

      Vioguard is currently seeking qualified partners to help bring the 
      product to market. Contact Larry Ranta, larryr@vioguard.com 
      for more information.

Vioguard Keyboard
This item will be released Summer 2017
The first and only self-sanitizing UV keyboard and track pad with FDA clearance.
The Vioguard Keyboard is a self-sanitizing UV keyboard and uses the germicidal properties of ultraviolet light (UV-C) to automatically disinfect the keyboard and track pad after every use. The system is 99.99% effective in killing harmful microorganisms within seconds, eliminating the need for manual disinfection and disposal of biohazard waste.
The Vioguard Keyboard does not require human intervention. The system is pre-set to automatically engage once the keyboard has been idle for a two, five or 10-minute interval, which is chosen by the user. Additionally, there is an option to manually close the keyboard after each use to sanitize the system – ensuring consistent and reliable disinfection.
The sanitization process engages automatically and confirms that the surfaces have been properly sanitized, ensuring consistent and reliable disinfection. The only disposable or maintenance item on the keyboard is the UV light tray. The light tray can be replaced by the end-user and can be recycled by sending it back to Vioguard.
