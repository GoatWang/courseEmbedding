	 TRIAN PARTNERS NOMINATES NELSON PELTZ
	FOR ELECTION TO PROCTER & GAMBLE BOARD





	 






	Files Preliminary Proxy Statement for
	P&G’s 2017 Annual Meeting







	 







	Shareholder Materials Available at RevitalizePG.com







	 






	NEW YORK, July 17, 2017—

	Trian Fund Management, L.P.
	(“Trian”), whose investment funds beneficially own approximately $3.3 billion of shares of The Procter & Gamble
	Company (NYSE: PG) (“P&G” or the “Company”), today filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission for the election of Nelson Peltz, its Chief Executive Officer and Founding Partner, to P&G’s
	Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As one of P&G’s largest shareholders, and given P&G’s
	disappointing results over the past decade, Trian has a keen interest in helping the Company address the challenges it is facing,
	which include:




	 






	Weak Total Shareholder Returns


	– Over the
	past decade, P&G has underperformed relative to both its peers and the S&P 500.


	1


	Over a 10-year period, P&G’s total return to shareholders was less than half that of its peers and has
	been in the bottom quartile over most recent time frames.


	2


	Trian believes P&G needs to address the factors contributing to this consistent underperformance, including:






	Deteriorating Market Share


	– Over the past
	five years, P&G’s organic sales growth has decelerated and the Company has lost market share across most of its categories.


	3







	·



	Organic sales and volume growth have been well below that of traditional large-cap consumer packaged goods peers.





	·



	Disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer packaged goods industry, including changes in technology and consumer behavior, and P&G must act with the greatest possible urgency to address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller local competitors, who are adapting to industry changes more effectively than P&G.




	 




















	Excessive Cost and Bureaucracy


	– P&G management
	acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy,


	4


	but it is clear to Trian that these critical issues have not been sufficiently addressed.





	·

	 


	Trian’s analysis shows that P&G’s $10 billion cost-cutting program, launched in 2012, has had no discernible impact on profits or sales growth.




	 




	 



	o


	 



	To the extent savings were reinvested to drive growth, there was little impact on organic volume growth, which was among the worst in class relative to peers from 2012 to 2016, and market shares declined.




	 



	o



	 


	Savings did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit was
	essentially flat from 2012 to 2016.


	5






	 





	·

	 


	Although P&G has stated that it has identified up to $13 billion of additional cost savings, given the Company’s track record, Trian is concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the 2012 program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder value creation.  





	·

	 


	P&G has an overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving and insular culture.




	 




	 



	o

	 


	Structural and organizational bureaucracy prevents management
	from identifying and responding to commercial opportunities in a timely manner, hinders product innovation and dampens sales
	growth.


	6






	 


	While P&G leadership says they are addressing the underperformance
	issue, shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results have not improved.  Trian believes P&G must take
	decisive action that goes above and beyond what P&G has presently committed to do.






	 









	 






	 




	Adding Nelson Peltz to the Board Will Help P&G Address
	These Challenges


	– Trian believes that Mr. Peltz’s significant expertise and long track record of working successfully
	with management teams and boards to turn around consumer companies and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value will be invaluable
	to P&G as it works to overcome its challenges.





	·

	 


	At consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has served on the
	Board of Directors, earnings-per-share growth has outpaced the S&P 500


	7


	by an average of 780 basis points annually.


	8







	·

	 


	Total shareholder returns at consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has
	served on the Board of Directors have outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 880 basis points annually.


	9






	 


	Trian believes that P&G’s challenges stem in large part
	from its organizational structure and culture, which can be highly resistant to change. Therefore, it is Trian’s strong view
	that the addition of a motivated independent director that has a material ownership stake and relevant industry experience can
	be a valuable resource for overcoming the root causes of these challenges.


	 




	What Trian is NOT Pushing For

	–

	Trian believes
	strongly in P&G’s potential, and as a long-term shareowner, its objective is to create sustainable long term shareholder
	value for all P&G shareholders. That means Trian is:





	·

	 


	NOT advocating for the break-up of the Company





	·

	 


	NOT suggesting that the CEO be replaced





	·

	 


	NOT seeking to replace directors





	·

	 


	NOT advocating taking on excessive leverage





	·

	 


	NOT seeking to cut pension benefits





	·

	 


	NOT suggesting that research & development, marketing expense or capital expenditures be reduced




	 


	Trian has made the decision to nominate Mr. Peltz for election
	to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting so that he can act as a catalyst for faster and more significant change at P&G. In
	connection with this nomination, Trian has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and launched the website www.RevitalizePG.com,
	which contains a brief shareholder presentation and other materials.


	 


	“Trian believes the job of a highly engaged shareowner in
	the boardroom is to foster a true sense of ownership among directors and inspire the board to take decisive and timely action to
	create sustainable, long-term value for both the company and its shareholders,” said Mr. Peltz. “As a member of the
	Board, it would be my goal to help improve performance by increasing sales and profits and regaining lost market share. I also
	believe the Board must address the company’s structure and culture. I can add far more value operating within the P&G
	boardroom than by merely looking in from the outside.”


	 


	Wishing to avoid a proxy contest, Trian had numerous constructive
	meetings and discussions with P&G management and a few Board members over the course of the past four months. Trian is disappointed
	that the Company has rejected Trian’s request to expand the Board by adding Mr. Peltz, who would be a representative of all
	shareholders. Trian still hopes to avoid the distraction of a proxy contest for the sake of all constituencies. However, it feels
	compelled to advocate for the changes it believes are necessary at P&G in order to enhance long-term value and return P&G
	to its position as the best-in-class consumer packaged goods company in terms of growing both market share and financial performance.
	Should Mr. Peltz be elected to a seat on P&G’s Board at its Annual Meeting, as a director, his first action






	 









	 






	would be to propose that the Board immediately re-appoint to the
	Board whichever current director has not been re-elected.

	Nelson Peltz is the Chief Executive Officer & Founding Partner
	of Trian, a highly regarded investment management firm formed in 2005. Over the course of his career, he has served on a number

	References to the S&P 500 throughout this press release refer to the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes
	the price changes of all underlying stocks and all dividends reinvested. S&P 500 data is obtained from Bloomberg using the
	SPX ticker with the inclusion of dividend re-investment.




	2


	Source: Capital IQ, SEC filings and annual reports. Total shareholder return of the S&P 500, the Company and
	its peers measured through June 15, 2017, one day before rumors surfaced of Trian seeking P&G Board representation. Trian
	considers the Company’s peers to include Beiersdorf, Church & Dwight, Clorox, Colgate, Edgewell Personal Care, Henkel,
	Kimberly-Clark, L’Oreal, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. We believe this peer group is relevant because each is domiciled
	in the United States or Europe, has a significant market capitalization and generates a significant portion of its sales in categories
	in which P&G competes.




	3


	Source: Company SEC filings. The Company’s organic sales growth was 0% in FY2016 and 2% year-to-date in FY2017,
	compared with a compound annual growth rate of 4% for organic sales from FY2006 through FY2011. In addition, the Company’s
	volume growth has trailed the average volume growth of its peers which disclose this data in four out of the five most recently
	completed years (indicating a loss of market share).




	4


	As referenced above, P&G announced a goal to reduce costs by $10 billion dollars by 2016 at the Consumer Analyst
	Group of New York Conference held on February 23, 2013. In addition, P&G identified an additional savings opportunity of up
	to $13 billion at the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference held on June 15, 2017.




	5


	Source: Company SEC filings. From FY2012 through FY 2016, the Company grew sales volumes at a compound annual growth
	rate of 0.6% and grew operating profit at a compound annual growth rate of -0.1%.




	6


	Trian believes that P&G’s organizational structure is overly “matrixed,” which we believe impedes
	growth by adding unnecessary complexity and cost. We understand that there are three overlapping organizational structures at
	P&G (Global Business Units as defined by category, Selling and Marketing Operations, and Corporate Functions), and in our
	view, these overlapping structures obscure accountability, increase bureaucracy and slow decision-making and impede sales growth
	and market shares.




	7


	We highlight the S&P 500 here only as a widely recognized index, however, for various reasons the performance
	of the index and that of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments (defined in footnote 8 below) may not be comparable. While
	Trian believes that earnings per share growth at Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments was attributable in large part to
	the cumulative effects of the implementation of operational and strategic initiatives during the period of Trian’s active
	involvement and beyond, there is no objective method to confirm what portion of such growth was attributable to Trian’s
	efforts and what may have been attributable to other factors. This press release does not provide the performance of Trian’s
	funds or the performance of individual fund investments.

	versus the S&P 500’s annual EPS growth during the time that Trian held the investment. Trian’s Engaged Consumer
	Investments” includes all of Trian’s food, beverage, restaurant, and retail-focused portfolio companies across all
	of our equity investment vehicles since inception that were held for one year or longer and where Trian also (x) had a designee
	or nominee on the Board, (y) was a Schedule 13D filer, and/or (z) wrote a “white paper” and met with management. Such
	investments do not represent all of the investments purchased or sold for Trian’s clients and it should not be assumed that
	any or all of these investments were or will be profitable.




	9


	Represents average total shareholder return (TSR) outperformance for the relevant companies vs. the S&P 500’s TSR from
	the date of Trian’s first purchase through the earlier of June 20, 2017, or the last day that the company’s shares
	were publicly traded. The TSR analysis reflects the change in the stock price of each of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments
	plus the effect of dividends received over the relevant time period. The TSR outperformance figures should not be construed as
	an indication of the performance of the funds managed by Trian and it should not be assumed that any or all of Trian’s Engaged
	Consumer Investments were or will be profitable in any of the funds managed by Trian.

	Since the filing of Amendment No. 50, each of Messrs. Peltz, May and M. Peltz, in their capacities as directors of the Company, received 1,238 shares of Common Stock on January 3, 2017 and 1,259 shares of Common Stock on April 3, 2017, in each case from the Company in lieu of Board of Directors retainer fees pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2010 Omnibus Award Plan.  In addition, on May 23, 2017 each of Messrs. Peltz, May and M. Peltz, received 6,510 restricted shares of Common Stock from the Company upon their re-election to the Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2010 Omnibus Award Plan.





	Certain shares of Common Stock held by the Trian Entities are held in the ordinary course of business with other investment securities owned by such Trian Entities in co-mingled margin accounts with a prime broker, which prime broker may, from time to time, extend margin credit to such Trian Entities, subject to applicable federal margin regulations, stock exchange rules and credit policies. Because other securities are held in Trian Entity margin accounts, it is not possible to determine the amounts, if any, of margin used to purchase such shares of Common Stock, and it may not be possible to determine the amounts of margin, if any, that could be used to purchase shares of Common Stock in the future by the Trian Entities or any other funds, accounts or investment vehicles managed by Trian Management. 





	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction





	Item 4 is hereby amended by adding the following:





	The sales of Shares by the Filing Persons reported in this Amendment No. 51 resulting in a reduction of their aggregate holdings from approximately 24.7% of the outstanding Common Stock to approximately 22.4% of the outstanding Common Stock (based upon 245,456,174  shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 4, 2017, as reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2017) were principally in connection with the sale of all of the shares of Common Stock owned directly by the Strategic Fund in connection with the upcoming expiration of the eight-year term of the fund. None of the Shares that were sold were owned directly by Messrs. Peltz, May, Garden or M. Peltz. Immediately following the consummation of such sales, the Filing Persons will continue to be the Company's largest stockholder (based on current share ownership information on file with the SEC), with an aggregate beneficial ownership of 55,109,938 shares.





	The Filing Persons intend to review alternatives with respect to their investment in the Company on a continuing basis.  Depending on various factors, including, without limitation, the Company's financial position, results of operations and strategic direction, price levels of the Common Stock, the Filing Persons' overall investment strategies, liquidity requirements and other portfolio management considerations, other investment opportunities available to the Filing Persons, conditions in the securities and capital markets, and general economic and industry conditions and applicable regulatory and legal constraints, the Filing Persons may, from time to time and at any time in the future, take such actions with respect to their investment in the Company as they deem appropriate, including, without limitation, communicating with the Company's other stockholders, industry participants and other interested or relevant parties about the Company, purchasing additional securities of the Company, entering into financial instruments or other agreements which increase or decrease the Filing Persons' economic exposure with respect to their investment in the Company and/or changing the form of ownership of securities of the Company by the Filing Persons, selling some or all of their holdings in the Company and/or otherwise changing their intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  The Filing Persons reserve the right at any time to formulate other plans and/or make other proposals, and take such actions with respect to their investment in the Company and/or change their intention with respect to any and all matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
