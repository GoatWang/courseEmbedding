Mar 15 17
Starboard Value LP has sold its stake in Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) people familiar with the matter said on March 15, 2017. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public.

Starboard Reportedly Pushes Rockwell Collins To Explore Strategic Alternatives
Nov 30 16
Rockwell Collins, Inc. is reportedly urged to explore strategic alternatives. Rockwell Collins is under pressure from Starboard Value LP to reconsider its $6.4 billion purchase of B/E Aerospace, Inc. (NasdaqGS:BEAV) and instead explore alternative options, including selling itself, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition to Jeff Smith’s activist fund, at least three other top-25 shareholders are planning to reject the B/E Aerospace deal in favor of a sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. Rockwell Collins is aware of the discontent among some of its shareholders, the people said. It’s unclear if the aerospace supplier is open to the idea of a sale. Pam Tvrdy, a spokeswoman for Rockwell Collins, declined to comment on the Starboard overture. A representative for B/E Aerospace didn’t respond to a request seeking comment. A representative for Starboard confirmed the fund has a stake in Rockwell but declined to comment further.
