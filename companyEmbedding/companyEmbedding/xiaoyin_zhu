Technology & Research Initiative Funding – Imaging









Xiaoyin Zhu

In Rongguang Liang’s group, we do optical and mechanical design of endoscopes and system testing. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, Colonoscopy is the preferred method to detect and remove precancerous polyps. The dual-view colonoscope we proposed can illuminate and image the colon in forward and omnidirectional backward directions without any obstructed view, allowing the polyps that are hidden from view to be easily seen while keeping the overall size of the system as small as 8 millimeters in diameter. In Liang’s group, we are also investigating the possibility of using different gel materials such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), optical encapsulation gel and UV glues to replace one or multiple elements in the optical imaging system. These materials are cheap and easy to make. If the optical and mechanical properties of these materials could meet the requirements of our imaging system, we could make the endoscopy system smaller and lighter in weight with less cost.
