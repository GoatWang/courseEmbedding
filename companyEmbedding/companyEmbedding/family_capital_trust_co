Privacy Disclosure
Family Capital is sensitive to the privacy of those that visit our Web site. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that is provided to us via this Web site. Family Capital has therefore established this Privacy Policy to assist you to understand what information we collect and how that information is used.

                    1) What personally identifiable information does Family Capital collect from you?
Family Capital collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. In general, you can visit the Family Capital Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track visiting domains, internet addresses of the domains from which people visit us to track a user's session and the user's browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system being used. This allows us to analyze the information as to which parts of our site users spend their time and their length of stay but does not give us any personal information about the user. Specifically, a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

                    Sometimes however, we will ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Generally this information is requested when you are asked for one or more of the following: 1) to register before downloading software; 2) registering for attendance to an online seminar, demo or a seminar or tradeshow; 3) filling out a sales information request or contact form; 4), viewing a recorded event; 5) becoming a registered user; 6) signing up for a mailing list; 7) during correspondence with us; 8) entering a sweepstakes or other promotional/informational feature via the Web site, or 9) completing a survey that we use for research, and 10) any other such activities as we deem necessary. Occasionally, we may use this information when we notify you about important changes to the Web site. Family Capital does not collect any personally identifiable financial or health-related information. However, you may be asked to provide information, including but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number.

                    2) How does Family Capital collect information and use information collected?

The mediums in which we may contact you are including but not limited to e-mail, telephone, or postal mail (for example, to send you information or special offers, or for other marketing purposes). We will not contact you unless you have either given us permission to do so or are a customer of Family Capital	.

                    When placing an order or requesting a download, we require that you first complete the registration/order form, including contact information such as name, mailing address, and your shipping address.

                    Additionally, we will use information to assist us in creating content that is relevant to you, to assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs, to provide you with access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select, and to help you quickly find software, services, or product information important to you.

Privacy Disclosure
Family Capital is sensitive to the privacy of those that visit our Web site. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of your personal information that is provided to us via this Web site. Family Capital has therefore established this Privacy Policy to assist you to understand what information we collect and how that information is used.

                    1) What personally identifiable information does Family Capital collect from you?
Family Capital collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. In general, you can visit the Family Capital Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track visiting domains, internet addresses of the domains from which people visit us to track a user's session and the user's browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system being used. This allows us to analyze the information as to which parts of our site users spend their time and their length of stay but does not give us any personal information about the user. Specifically, a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

                    Sometimes however, we will ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Generally this information is requested when you are asked for one or more of the following: 1) to register before downloading software; 2) registering for attendance to an online seminar, demo or a seminar or tradeshow; 3) filling out a sales information request or contact form; 4), viewing a recorded event; 5) becoming a registered user; 6) signing up for a mailing list; 7) during correspondence with us; 8) entering a sweepstakes or other promotional/informational feature via the Web site, or 9) completing a survey that we use for research, and 10) any other such activities as we deem necessary. Occasionally, we may use this information when we notify you about important changes to the Web site. Family Capital does not collect any personally identifiable financial or health-related information. However, you may be asked to provide information, including but not limited to, your name, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number.

                    You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, you may not be able to complete the applicable transaction.

                    2) How does Family Capital collect information and use information collected?

                    When we capture such information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our Web site and the services we offer you. We will ask you if you want us to use the information you provide to continue contact with you. The mediums in which we may contact you are including but not limited to e-mail, telephone, or postal mail (for example, to send you information or special offers, or for other marketing purposes). We will not contact you unless you have either given us permission to do so or are a customer of Family Capital	.

                    When placing an order or requesting a download, we require that you first complete the registration/order form, including contact information such as name, mailing address, and your shipping address.

                    Additionally, we will use information to assist us in creating content that is relevant to you, to assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs, to provide you with access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select, and to help you quickly find software, services, or product information important to you.

                    4) What is Family Capital's policy regarding links to other Web sites and third parties?
Family Capital's Web site may contain links to other sites on the Internet, which are owned and operated by Family Capital's partners, customers, advertisers and other third parties. Family Capital has not reviewed and will not review these Web sites, which are linked to the Family Capital Web site.

                    The other circumstance under which Family Capital may disclose your personal information to another party is when legally required to do so or when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires such a disclosure. For example, we will share such information if we have reason to believe that the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be either causing injury to or interference with Family Capital's rights or property, or Family Capital customers or affiliates.

                    6) What options do you have regarding collection, use and distribution of your information?
If you provide us with your e-mail or postal address, or have done so in the past, we may use it to send you information on the latest Family Capital products, promotions, and events.
