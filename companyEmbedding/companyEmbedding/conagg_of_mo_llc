Construction and Agricultural Aggregates from Missouri Rock













































Questions? Call us at (573) 446-0905
















					Aggregates from Boone and Norris Quarries			








Boone Quarries proudly services Mid-Missouri, with locations in Columbia and Sedalia.  We are geared to serve small applications such as residential driveways to large scale projects including work with MoDOT, the University of Missouri, Whiteman Air Force Base and countless commercial projects throughout the area.  Getting rock to your project, large or small, is simply a phone call away.








Norris Quarries has several locations throughout North Central and Northwest Missouri.  Norris Quarries is a producer of crushed limestone products for a variety of residential, commercial and state applications.  Many of our locations are certified to provide material to the US Army Corps of Engineers as well.





Products




Base
Clean
Road Rock
Rip Rap
Ag Lime








 


Base
Base products are used to stabilize sub grade beneath asphalt and concrete paving, and commonly used for building parking lots and highways.  Base rocks are designed to compact and create a hard, sealed surface.  Con-Agg produces quality materials meeting MODOT specifications for Type 1, Type 5 base, and Type 7 base.









 


Clean
Clean or course aggregates consist of chips, 1” clean (#57), 2” clean, and 3” clean.  Clean aggregates are typically used in the production of ready mix concrete or hot mix asphalt, chip and seal, pipe bedding, septic systems or to stabilize wet ground conditions.  Smaller clean rock is also commonly used on driveways.









 


Road Rock
Road rock is used primarily as a surface application to county and state rock roadways, as this product is similar to base, but contains less fines and typically does not compact.   Con-Agg offers road rock from ¾”, 1”, 1 ¼” and 2” top size, depending on volume of traffic on the roadway.









 


Rip Rap
Rip rap is large rocks that are well graded and clean for use along shorelines of rivers and lakes to help control erosion, drainage systems, and sediment.  Con-Agg produces rip rap to meet various size specifications of MODOT, and some quarry locations produce rip rap meeting Corps of Engineer specifications.









 


Ag Lime
Agricultural lime is a key component to successful crop production.  Ag Lime improves the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil to maintain proper soil acidity.  Excess soil acidity will negatively affect crop yield, profitability, and long-term soil productivity.








 






Ordering/Quoting
To order material, please find the location that is nearest you and contact the scale house direct. They will ensure that you get the product you need and will arrange for delivery.
For large-scale commercial or DOT projects please contact the sale representative in your area.
Con-Agg personnel are at your service to help you evaluate your project, anticipate your needs and ensure the material and service you receive meets your expectation all the way through to job completion.
For general questions, fill out the contact form on the Contact page or email sales@conagg-mo.com.

					Aggregates from Boone and Norris Quarries			








Boone Quarries proudly services Mid-Missouri, with locations in Columbia and Sedalia.  We are geared to serve small applications such as residential driveways to large scale projects including work with MoDOT, the University of Missouri, Whiteman Air Force Base and countless commercial projects throughout the area.  Getting rock to your project, large or small, is simply a phone call away.








Norris Quarries has several locations throughout North Central and Northwest Missouri.  Norris Quarries is a producer of crushed limestone products for a variety of residential, commercial and state applications.  Many of our locations are certified to provide material to the US Army Corps of Engineers as well.





Products




Base
Clean
Road Rock
Rip Rap
Ag Lime








 


Base
Base products are used to stabilize sub grade beneath asphalt and concrete paving, and commonly used for building parking lots and highways.  Base rocks are designed to compact and create a hard, sealed surface.  Con-Agg produces quality materials meeting MODOT specifications for Type 1, Type 5 base, and Type 7 base.









 


Clean
Clean or course aggregates consist of chips, 1” clean (#57), 2” clean, and 3” clean.  Clean aggregates are typically used in the production of ready mix concrete or hot mix asphalt, chip and seal, pipe bedding, septic systems or to stabilize wet ground conditions.  Smaller clean rock is also commonly used on driveways.









 


Road Rock
Road rock is used primarily as a surface application to county and state rock roadways, as this product is similar to base, but contains less fines and typically does not compact.   Con-Agg offers road rock from ¾”, 1”, 1 ¼” and 2” top size, depending on volume of traffic on the roadway.









 


Rip Rap
Rip rap is large rocks that are well graded and clean for use along shorelines of rivers and lakes to help control erosion, drainage systems, and sediment.  Con-Agg produces rip rap to meet various size specifications of MODOT, and some quarry locations produce rip rap meeting Corps of Engineer specifications.









 


Ag Lime
Agricultural lime is a key component to successful crop production.  Ag Lime improves the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil to maintain proper soil acidity.  Excess soil acidity will negatively affect crop yield, profitability, and long-term soil productivity.








 






Ordering/Quoting
To order material, please find the location that is nearest you and contact the scale house direct. They will ensure that you get the product you need and will arrange for delivery.
For large-scale commercial or DOT projects please contact the sale representative in your area.
Con-Agg personnel are at your service to help you evaluate your project, anticipate your needs and ensure the material and service you receive meets your expectation all the way through to job completion.
For general questions, fill out the contact form on the Contact page or email sales@conagg-mo.com.
