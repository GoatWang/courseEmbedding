Rolled Products


Our manufacturing sites in North America, Europe and China produce rolled aluminum sheet, plate and fabricated products for various industries.
In North America we primarily serve the automotive,  building and construction, transportation and consumer durables industries through both direct relationships with manufacturers and as a supplier to metal distributors.  In the European market, we produce a variety of alloys and products for a number of technically sophisticated applications ‐ in aerospace plate and sheet, automotive sheet and heat-treated plate for other industries.  In China, we produce aluminum plate for the aerospace industry as well as a variety of technically demanding industrial uses.
Plate
Aleris manufactures many different plates in various standard and customer-specified alloys using some of the world’s most advanced hot and cold rolling mills. With a 160-inch (4.064 m) hot rolling mill and a 148-inch (3.760 m) cold rolling mill, we can produce very wide and ultra-thick plates, either heat treated or non-heat treated. High-quality aluminum plates from Aleris meet the most demanding standards, plus many individual customer specifications.
We have continued to expand our production capabilities to better serve global customers. Most recently, we opened a hot rolling mill in Zhenjiang, China designed to meet fast-growing regional and global demand for technically advanced aluminum plate products for aerospace and commercial plate customers. The state-of-the-art plant, one of only a handful in the world, was modeled after our facility in Koblenz, Germany. It is equipped to produce the most advanced value-added aluminum material for aerospace and leading manufacturers in a variety of fast-growing industries in China and worldwide. This latest facility is ISO certified and Nadcap accredited for the production of aircraft aluminum plate.
Our investment in a full-scale direct-chill (DC) pilot caster at our facility in Koblenz, Germany, illustrates our commitment to increasing our technical leadership in highly demanding market segments. The specialized facility is able to cast full-scale ingots for trials as well as for serial production of aluminum-lithium products.
Sheet & Coil
Aleris is a leading producer of flat rolled aluminum sheet. We have continued to expand our capacity, geographic footprint and supply chain flexibility for this product segment – all of which enhances our level of service to customers.
We also have world-class automotive aluminum manufacturing capability in Duffel, Belgium, that produces the widest automotive body sheet available. Aleris expanded its Duffel facility to deliver state-of-the-art light-weight solutions that meet the tolerance and width needs of automotive applications. Through the installation of our new wide cold rolling mill, we better equipped to provide our customers with state-of-the-art lightweight solutions as tighter fuel efficiency requirements drive auto manufacturers to expand their application of aluminum to include hoods, door panels, and trunks. The company is investing $350 million in its Lewisport, Kentucky facility to bring these capabilities to North America. We expect to begin shipping to customers from this facility by 2017.
Our state-of-the-art equipment for sheet and coil production uses the Continuous Annealing Line with Pre-Treatment (CALP), which enables us to produce sheet and coil in various alloys and tempers, for many industries and a wide variety of applications.
Aleris is also a leading supplier of common-alloy, mill-finish (bare) sheet made from recycled aluminum via two different methods: direct-chill and continuous-cast. In direct-chill casting, molten metal is solidified in a water-cooled, open-ended mold and water is applied directly to the emerging ingot. Continuous casting rapidly solidifies molten metal in a cooled mold. The metal is continuously withdrawn and hot rolled while the mold is simultaneously replenished with liquid metal.

Saturday, September 17, 2016 (5:13am)

CLOSE



CLEVELAND, Aug. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Aleris Corporation, a global aluminum rolled products producer, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Zhongwang USA LLC, a company majority-owned and led by Mr. Liu Zhongtian, founder of China Zhongwang Holdings Limited ("China Zhongwang", HKEX code: 01333).  The aggregate value of Aleris amounts to $2.33 billion, comprising $1.11 billion in cash for the equity to be paid by Zhongwang USA, plus $1.22 billion in net debt.
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140115/CL46886LOGO 
Aleris will continue to be headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and will be operated as an independent entity. The Aleris management team will remain in place, providing continuity for Aleris employees and customers and supporting the continued implementation of the Aleris strategy.  
Aleris will retain its name and continue to serve its customers with no changes to current operations, contracts or commitments.  It will continue with the implementation of all strategic growth projects, including its major expansion project in Lewisport, Kentucky, which will enable Aleris to meet the North American automotive industry's growing demand for aluminum auto body sheet.
"We are excited about this transition to strategic ownership as it will allow us to accelerate our strategy to expand our capabilities to support the production of high-value advanced materials for the global automotive and aerospace markets, while maintaining our position as a leading supplier to critical regional markets like building and construction," said Sean Stack, President and CEO of Aleris.  "We expect the transition to be seamless for our employees and customers, and that the new strategic shareholder will provide us with greater financial flexibility to continue to anticipate and meet the needs of our customers well into the future."
The acquisition of Aleris reflects Mr. Liu's commitment to disciplined operating investments over the long-term in an industry to which he has been committed for two decades.  In addition to his role at Zhongwang USA, Mr. Liu is also the chairman and founder of China Zhongwang, the second largest aluminum extrusions product developer and manufacturer in the world and the largest in Asia.  With the acquisition of Aleris, Mr. Liu will now oversee companies that have complementary geographic footprints and capabilities.
"This acquisition is an international expansion to establish a complementary business foothold, as I strongly believe in the potential and prospects of Aleris and the aluminum industry as a whole," Mr. Liu said.  "Aleris has a strong management team, talented employees and industry-leading capabilities with a complementary geographic footprint.  As the company enters the final phase of its Lewisport automotive project, I believe Aleris is well-positioned to capitalize on the positive demand trends we see globally, and I look forward to supporting the Aleris management team in implementing their growth strategies and pursuing continued success with expanded resources and financial and operational flexibility."
Since 2010, Aleris has been owned and controlled by a group led by certain investment funds of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., with affiliates of Apollo Management, L.P., and Sankaty Advisors, LLC owning minority interests. 
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 following the customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. 
Credit Suisse acted as financial advisor to Aleris.  Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson, LLP acted as legal advisors.  Moelis & Co. advised the Aleris Board on certain aspects of this transaction. Paul, Weiss, Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as legal advisors to Oaktree Capital Management.

For more information, visit www.aleris.com.

Aleris International, Inc. is one of the larger private companies in the United States, as ranked by Forbes in 2011.[2] It is a producer of aluminum rolled and extruded products, recycled aluminum, and specification aluminum alloy manufacturing. Its headquarters are in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and it has access to 40 production facilities across the world.[1]
Aleris was formed in 2004 through the merger of Commonwealth Industries, Inc. and IMCO Recycling Inc.[1][3]
In February 2009, the US Justice Department filed suit against Aleris alleging that 15 of its plants had violated the Clean Air Act by emission of pollutants. In August 2009, Aleris settled the suit with the government, and agreed to pay a $4.6 million fine and spend an additional $4.2 million on new pollution controls at its plants.[4][5]
Aleris filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 12 February 2009.[6] It announced plans in May 2010 to exit bankruptcy as a privately held company owned by investment funds of Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management, and Sankaty Advisors.[7][8][needs update]
In August 2016 it was announced that the Chinese aluminum extruder company China Zhongwang would buy Aleris for $2.33 billion.[9]

Aleris International, Inc. is one of the larger private companies in the United States, as ranked by Forbes in 2011.[2] It is a producer of aluminum rolled and extruded products, recycled aluminum, and specification aluminum alloy manufacturing. Its headquarters are in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and it has access to 40 production facilities across the world.[1]
Aleris was formed in 2004 through the merger of Commonwealth Industries, Inc. and IMCO Recycling Inc.[1][3]
In February 2009, the US Justice Department filed suit against Aleris alleging that 15 of its plants had violated the Clean Air Act by emission of pollutants. In August 2009, Aleris settled the suit with the government, and agreed to pay a $4.6 million fine and spend an additional $4.2 million on new pollution controls at its plants.[4][5]
Aleris filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 12 February 2009.[6] It announced plans in May 2010 to exit bankruptcy as a privately held company owned by investment funds of Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management, and Sankaty Advisors.[7][8][needs update]
In August 2016 it was announced that the Chinese aluminum extruder company China Zhongwang would buy Aleris for $2.33 billion.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
