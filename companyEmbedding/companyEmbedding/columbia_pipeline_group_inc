Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. Company Profile

   Columbia Pipeline Group was formed in 2015 as a fee-based, growth-oriented limited partnership by NiSource to own, operate and develop pipelines, storage, and related midstream assets. Its operating company, Columbia OpCo, is a partnership between NiSource subsidiary Columbia Energy Group (CEG), and Columbia Pipeline Partners. Columbia OpCo owns CEG's natural gas transmission and storage assets (15,000 miles of interstate pipelines extending from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems). In 2014, 94% of Columbia OpCo's revenues came from firm revenue contracts. Columbia Pipeline Group went public as an independent company in July 2015. A year later it was acquired by TransCanada.
