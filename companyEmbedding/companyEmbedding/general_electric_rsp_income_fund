The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryIntermediate-Term BondFund FamilyGE Asset ManagementNet Assets2.41BYTD Return2.59%Yield2.39%Morningstar Rating★★★Inception DateJan 31, 1980Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.03Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover242.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseGESLXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)0.21%0.77%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio0.17%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio0.17%N/AMax 12b1 FeeN/AN/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A3.92%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.66%3 Yr Expense Projection5N/A5 Yr Expense Projection8N/A10 Yr Expense Projection17N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Morningstar is an independent fund rating company that seeks to provide a       
non-biased rating system used in making investment decisions. A fund is rated in
its category on a scale of one to five stars through the evaluation of the      
historical balance of risk and adjusted return after 3 years of performance.    

Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted
Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance      
(including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing    
more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The  
top ten percent of the funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5%
receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive 2  
stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The ratings are subject to change every
month. The overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted     
average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten    
year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrix.                                 

Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate and you   
may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Returns assume changes in    
share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.                    

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

                                                     A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
This is your Annual Report for the GE S&S Funds for the year ended December 31,
2002. I encourage you to take a few minutes to review our analysis of how the   
investment markets performed during 2002, as well as our thoughts on the outlook
for 2003. For more information about the performance of a particular Fund,      
please turn to your portfolio managers' commentaries and the specific Fund data 
included later on in this report.                                               

 MARKET OVERVIEW
Most investors breathed a sigh of relief when the year was finally over, however
their expectations entering 2002 had been more hopeful. America was dealing     
resolutely with the implications of 9/11 and U.S. stock markets had rallied     
strongly during the 4th quarter of 2001 amid signs that the economy was about to
recover its lost momentum. Inflation was under control, the Federal Reserve had 
been extraordinarily accommodative in lowering interest rates a total of eleven 
times, and consumers seemed willing to continue to spend their money. These     
guarded hopes for an improved investing environment were doomed to be dashed on 
the rocks we all confronted in 2002.                                            

What actually happened to investment performance? The year 2002 made its        
disappointing contribution to the worst U.S. equity market decline experienced  
since the 1930's by delivering a third consecutive year of negative performance.
After plumbing the depths in early October, it continued to deliver bad news by 
posting the worst December monthly performance since 1931 for stocks in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500), and the 
worst December ever recorded in the NASDAQ's 30-year history of tracking        
technology stocks. From its peak in March 2000 to the trough of October 9th,    
2002, the S&P 500 index lost just over half of its value! For the full year of  
2002, the S&P 500 index lost 22.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Index slid 14.9%,  
and NASDAQ declined by 31.5%. Major international equity markets in Europe and  
the Far East, while outperforming the USA in dollar terms, also suffered a rough
ride, which the weakening U.S. dollar helped to mitigate. A widely followed     
international equity index, MSCI-EAFE, declined 15.9% for the year when         
expressed in dollar terms, but actually dropped 26.1% when expressed in local   
currency terms. In the public security markets, the only positive returns were  
delivered by fixed income, which benefited from continued low interest rates as 
the Federal Reserve bank cut short-term rates once more, to the lowest levels   
seen in over 40 years, and from funds spilling out of equities into the         
apparently safer harbor offered by fixed income. Even in fixed income there were
pitfalls, as the number of corporate downgrades rose to new heights as many     
companies struggled to perform in the tough economic environment. The reasons   
underpinning this generally dismal investment picture are many. They include a  
relatively anemic economy, which started out the year with a strong quarter,    
slowed in the second quarter, re-accelerated in the 3rd quarter but then fizzled
in the fourth quarter. Consumers continued to spend, and refinancing mortgages  
proved a more profitable way to raise cash than selling stocks, but even        
consumers showed signs of weariness as the year came to a close. Businesses,    
unimpressed with the economy and unable to get price as capacity utilization    
fell in tandem with rises in inventories, generally stayed on the sidelines in  
terms of investment spending. In addition to the weak economic recovery, other  
factors weighed on the markets, chief among them the increasing drumbeat of     
geopolitical concerns in the war against terrorism and against countries        
suspected of having weapons of mass destruction. Overlaying these issues was a  
slew of disclosures in the corporate world regarding accounting scandals and    
conflicts of interest involving several large companies, their auditors, and    
corporate executives, leading to decreased confidence by investors in the       
quality of reported earnings of companies in general. A further concern was the 
declining health of the pension funds of many of the nation's leading companies,
hit by both poor returns on their funded assets and higher liabilities driven by
lower interest rates.                                                           

MARKET OUTLOOK
Looking forward, we see an investing environment filled with more than the usual
array of pluses and minuses. On the asset side of the "balance sheet," the      
Federal Reserve Bank has certainly been accommodative and the Bush              
administration is proposing a fiscal stimulus spending bill in the third year of
its term, a time when reelection realities usually translate into better equity 
returns. The economy continues to benefit from low inflation along with good    
productivity gains, and visible earnings growth should underpin the mood of the 
market. Finally, the sheer duration and magnitude of the bear market,

                                         A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT (CONTINUED)

coupled with the fact that market measures such as price/earnings multiples are 
returning to more normal levels, suggests that 2003 may demonstrate a moderate  
upward bias for the year, driven by positive earnings.                          

Geopolitical shocks remain a wildcard that clearly could derail a fragile       
recovery. In addition to the well-known global trouble spots, other negatives   
include high levels of consumer debt, continued weak capital spending, growing  
government deficits and a weakening dollar, which makes the U.S. less attractive
to foreign investors. We also did not encounter the type of retail market       
capitulation that usually heralds a bottom, but this may reflect the fact that  
alternatives to investing in stocks were not as convincingly attractive to      
investors as they have been in times past.                                      

 FUND HIGHLIGHTS
Despite an extremely challenging market environment, I am very pleased to report
that two of your Funds have generated consistent returns that stand out from    
their peers.                                                                    

GE S&S PROGRAM MUTUAL FUND and GE S&S INCOME FUND both generated performances   
that ranked in the top 20% of their Lipper competitive groups for the one,      
three, five and ten-year periods ending on December 31, 2002.                   

CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATH FOR YOUR INVESTMENTS
There's little doubt that investor attitudes and expectations are far different 
now from those that prevailed during the 1990s. Back then, year after year of   
double-digit returns triggered unbridled optimism, and stock markets were       
complacently assumed to be able to continue to deliver double-digit positive    
returns as far as the eye could see. Since then, the markets have taught a      
painful lesson to those who invested too aggressively, or who failed to         
diversify their portfolios effectively.                                         

Where do we go from here? From our perspective, we are cautiously optimistic    
that U.S. stocks can deliver modest positive performance in 2003, at least      
partly because a four-year streak of losses is almost unprecedented, only       
occurring once in the 20th century (1929-1932) and once in the 19th century     
(1836-1839). Companies have generally done a good job in managing costs and when
demand ultimately recovers, operating leverage should provide a welcome boost to
earnings. In the international arena, valuations, combined with historic low    
interest rates, should provide a platform for markets to rally, and continued   
dollar weakness would serve to enhance dollar-based returns. U.S. fixed income  
rates are unlikely to fall much further, unless the current low inflationary    
environment shifts to a much more pernicious deflationary mode, and,            
accordingly, fixed income returns should reflect coupon returns with little, or 
even negative, capital appreciation. Overall, we are expecting a moderate       
economic recovery laced with sufficient concerns to make careful bottom-up      
security selection of vital importance.                                         

This scenario can create attractive opportunities for thoughtful investors. It  
makes sense to assess where you stand today, re-calibrate your comfort level    
with investment risk, and structure a diversified portfolio to help you reach   
your financial goals with an appropriate mix of anticipated investment          
performance and portfolio volatility.                                           

As always, we are committed at GE S&S Funds to helping you achieve your         
financial plans. Our portfolio professionals maintain a long-term view of the   
markets and work hard to position your Funds effectively to take advantage of   
today's best opportunities. With so much happening so quickly in today's        
markets, I encourage you to visit us regularly at our website,

Q. HOW DID THE GE S&S PROGRAM MUTUAL FUND PERFORM COMPARED TO ITS BENCHMARK AND 
LIPPER PEER GROUP FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002?    

A. The GE S&S Program Mutual Fund declined 18.91% in 2002 compared to a decline 
   of 22.10% for the S&P 500 benchmark. The Lipper peer group, consisting of 964
Large Cap Core funds, declined 23.73% for the same period.                

Q. WHY DID THE FUND OUTPERFORM ITS BENCHMARK FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 
2002?                                                                     

A. The portfolio out-performed the benchmark due to solid stock selection in    
several sectors including technology, healthcare, industrials, energy,    
telecommunications, and utilities. In most of these sectors, good stock   
selection included avoiding many of the companies that did poorly over the
period in addition to selecting companies that had better relative        
performance.                                                              

Q. WHICH STOCKS PERFORMED WELL OVER THE PERIOD?                                 

A. In technology, the S&P 500 benchmark holdings were down almost 38%, while the
portfolio holdings declined 31.4%. Relative performance in this sector was
driven by better industry performance in the portfolio in several groups, 
   such as software, communications equipment, and computers. Intuit, a software
   company best known for its tax and accounting software products was up almost
  10% for the year. In healthcare, better relative performance from healthcare
  provider stocks, such as Cardinal Health, Lincare Holdings, and UnitedHealth
Group helped performance. In addition, several pharmaceutical holdings,   
including Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and Pharmacia, contributed to relative
   performance over the period. While industrials declined more than 25% for the
S&P 500, several holdings in our Fund, including First Data, Emerson      
   Electric, General Dynamics, and United Technologies helped this sector of the
portfolio post a better relative return of -21.9% for the year. Energy    
 stocks, representing a larger-than-average position in the portfolio due to
  improving commodity prices and positive supply/demand fundamentals, finished
  the year with better relative performance from holdings such as EnCana Corp,
Burlington Resources, Exxon, Nabors Industries, and Baker Hughes. In the  
telecommunications services sector, better relative performance in the    
  diversified telecommunications and the wireless industries helped to drive a
positive contribution from this area. A reduced position in the utilities 
sector was the primary driver of performance better than the benchmark, as
the sector was down more than 30% over the year. A few electric utility   
   companies held in the portfolio, including Entergy, Exelon, and Constellation
Energy, all posted positive absolute performance amid a difficult         
environment.

Q. HOW HAVE THE ACCOUNTING SCANDALS IMPACTED THE FUND?                          

A. There is no question that the corporate accounting scandals have had a       
negative impact on investor confidence. In addition to the Enron debacle, 
  several other high profile scandals, including potential misappropriation of
company funds at Tyco and possible accounting fraud at Worldcom, have     
  triggered investor's fears regarding U.S. companies. Corporate governance is
  an issue of increasing importance. Boards of Directors are being scrutinized
for independence following several high profile lapses in oversight. While
"visibility of earnings" was the mantra in recent years, "credibility of  
earnings" has quickly supplanted this notion. The trust and confidence in 
  standard financial information has been called into question and a number of
   regulatory changes appear to be in the offing. The Fund has not been directly
affected by the accounting scandals to date. The Fund did not own Enron or
Worldcom, and owned a very small position in Tyco. That said, in our due  
  diligence process, we make every attempt to assess company managements along
with their balance sheets and other financial factors but it is obviously 
very difficult to uncover fraudulent behavior.                            

Q. WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FUND?                                           

A. Following three straight down years, the market is obviously overdue for a   
recovery and we do expect a modest positive return as corporate earnings  
   slowly recover later in the year. Uncertainty relating to terrorism and other
  geopolitical concerns will probably limit the upside potential of the market
and result in a continuing period of above average volatility. This is the
kind of environment where stock selection, driven by strong fundamental   
  research, should pay off by helping us generate good returns relative to our
benchmark measurement.

ROBERT MACDOUGALL IS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND LEAD PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR GE 
ASSET MANAGEMENT'S FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT TEAM. BOB JOINED GEAM IN 1986 AS VICE
PRESIDENT. HE BECAME A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT IN 1993 AND EXECUTIVE VICE         
PRESIDENT IN 1997. PRIOR TO JOINING GEAM, BOB HELD A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL       
MANAGEMENT POSITIONS WITHIN GE'S CORPORATE TREASURY AND FINANCIAL PLANNING      
DEPARTMENTS. BOB RECEIVED BOTH HIS MASTERS AND BACHELORS IN BUSINESS            
ADMINISTRATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS.                            
Q. HOW DID THE S&S INCOME FUND PERFORM RELATIVE TO ITS BENCHMARK AND LIPPER PEER
GROUP FOR THE 12- MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002?                   

A. The S&S Income Fund posted a total return of 10.42%, compared to a total     
return of 10.26% for the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. The Lipper 
   peer group, consisting of 380 Intermediate Taxable Bond funds, returned 8.14%
for the same period.                                                      

Q. HOW DID MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECT FUND PERFORMANCE OVER THE ONE- YEAR PERIOD  
ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002?                                                 

A. The U.S. economy rebounded in 2002 from the prior year's recession, supported
 by a drop in business inventory liquidation, consumer spending and a strong
 housing market. Hopes of a typical post-recession boom were undermined by a
hit to investor confidence brought on by corporate malfeasance, accounting
scandals and rising geopolitical risks, not to mention a soft labor market
and a third year of negative equity returns. Interest rates fell          
significantly during the year, pushing bond prices up. The yield on the   
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a 44-year low in early October   
before drifting back up to end the year at 3.81%, down nearly 1.25%.      
 Short-term interest rates fell further as investors preferred the safety of
  short maturity Treasury securities over riskier assets, such as equities and
corporate bonds. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) left their target for the  
   Federal Funds rate unchanged until November when the rate was 0.50% to 1.25%,
reflecting concern over the pace of the economic recovery.                

   High quality assets performed best in 2002, led by commercial mortgage-backed
securities (up 15.32%) and U.S. Treasuries (returning 11.79%). Corporate  
securities were heading for a disastrous yearly performance until they    
rebounded strongly in November, sparked in part by the Fed's rate cutting 
   moves and Republicans winning control of Congress. The credit sector suffered
 from a record amount of "fallen angels" (issuers downgraded from investment
grade to below investment grade). Several of the largest such events in   
history occurred last year, namely, Worldcom, Qwest, El Paso and Tyco.

                                                              GE S&S INCOME FUND

Q. WHAT WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF FUND PERFORMANCE?                           

A. Fund performance in 2002 benefited primarily from favorable security         
 selection among corporate and mortgage-backed securities. Our defensive and
well-diversified posture within our corporate holdings, given the         
preponderance of negative event risk last year, kept us clear of many poor
performing issuers and prompted us to sell out of names such as Worldcom, 
Qwest and AOL before their prices significantly dropped due to ratings    
  downgrades. Effective positioning in collateralized mortgage obligations and
   certain pass- through securities contributed to the performance of the Fund's
overall position in mortgage-backed issues. Allocation shifts across the  
various sectors throughout the year also added to the Fund's return.      

Q. WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FUND AND THE BOND MARKET?                       

A. Over the next few quarters, we look for sub-par economic growth of           
  approximately 2%, producing single digit earnings growth. Continued mortgage
  refinancing, despite high debt levels, should support consumer spending, but
business investment is expected to remain weak. Although further monetary 
stimulus in this environment is unlikely, fiscal stimulus will come in the
  form of tax cuts and spending (primarily military). Although a war with Iraq
  may dampen economic growth, the extent will depend on the duration of such a
conflict. The biggest risk to our outlook develops if low growth depresses
  corporate profits, making debt service more onerous, leading to more cuts in
employment, subsequently hurting confidence and consumer spending. A      
recession most likely would be accompanied by lower inflation, if not     
   deflation. Although the risk of recession or deflation is real, we give it at
most a moderate probability of occurrence.                                

  We cannot make a convincing case that interest rates will move significantly
in either direction over the near term. Economic recovery typically pushes
 yields higher, however geopolitical risks (war with Iraq, a renewed nuclear
   risk in North Korea) should help to prop up investor demand for the safety of
U.S. Treasuries, limiting any upward trend in their yields. We therefore  
   begin 2003 with a neutral interest rate sensitivity in the portfolio. We have
 lightened our exposure to mortgage-backed securities in favor of government
agency debt. We continue to see value in commercial mortgage-backed       
 securities and maintain our above-average position in that sector. Although
corporate securities had a great fourth quarter, we remain cautious on the
 sector given our outlook for sub-par growth plus the added uncertainties of
  war. As was the case last year, security selection will likely be the key to
the Fund's success.

                                                NOTES TO PERFORMANCE (UNAUDITED)

Information on the preceding performance pages relating to the Funds' one year  
total return and top ten holdings is audited, all other information is          
unaudited.                                                                      

Total returns take into account changes in share price and assume reinvestment  
of dividends and capital gains distributions, if any. Investment returns and net
asset value on an investment will fluctuate and you may have a gain or loss when
you sell your shares.                                                           

The Standard & Poor's ("S&P") 500 Composite Index of stocks (S&P 500) and the   
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (LB Aggregate) are unmanaged indices and do
not reflect the actual cost of investing in the instruments that comprise each  
index. The S&P 500 is a capitalization- weighted index of 500 widely held stocks
recognized by investors to be representative of the stock market in general. LB 
Aggregate is a composite index of short-, medium-, and long-term bond           
performance and is widely recognized as a barometer of the bond market in       
general. The results shown for the foregoing indices assume the reinvestment of 
net dividends or interest and are unaudited.                                    

The peer universe of funds used in our peer ranking calculation is based on the 
blend of Lipper peer categories, as shown. This blend is the same as the        
category blend used by the Wall Street Journal. The actual number of funds and  
numerical rankings in the Lipper and Wall Street Journal universes could differ 
since the Wall Street Journal excludes certain funds, which do not meet their   
net asset or number of shareholder publication thresholds. Lipper is an         
independent mutual fund rating service.                                         

The views expressed in this document reflect our judgment as of the publication 
date and are subject to change at any time without notice. The securities cited 
may not represent future holdings and should not be considered as a             
recommendation to purchase or sell a particular security. See the GE S&S Program
Disclosure Statement for more information about the Funds' investment           
objectives, policies, risks, and permissible investments.

   NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF INVESTMENTS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) -- DECEMBER 31, 2002

(a)   Non-income producing security.                                            

(b)   Pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, these securities may 
     be resold in transactions exempt from registration, normally to qualified
    institutional buyers. At December 31, 2002, these securities amounted to
$22,927 or 0.87% of net assets for the GE S&S Income Fund. These    
     securities have been determined to be liquid using procedures established
by the Board of Trustees.                                           

(c)   Settlement is on a delayed delivery or when-issued basis with final       
maturity to be announced (TBA) in the future.                       

(d)   Coupon amount represents effective yield.                                 

(e)   State Street Corp. is the parent company of State Street Bank and Trust

(f)   Principal only securities represent the right to receive the monthly      
 principal payments on an underlying pool of mortgages. No payments of
   interest on the pool are passed through to the "principal only" holder.

(g)   Interest only securities represent the right to receive the monthly       
interest payments on an underlying pool of mortgages. Payments of   
  principal on the pool reduce the value of the "interest only" holding.

(h)   At December 31, 2002, all or a portion of this security was pledged to    
cover collateral requirements for futures, options, forward foreign

    is also the Investment Advisor of the GEI Short-Term Investment Fund. No
     advisory fee is charged by GEAM to the GEI Short-Term Investment Fund nor
     will the Fund incur any sales charge, redemption fee, distribution fee or
service fee in connection with its investments in the GEI Short-Term
Investment Fund.                                                    

(k)   All or a portion of security is out on loan.                              

(l)   All or a portion of the security purchased with collateral from securities
lending.                                                            

The maturity date disclosed for fixed income securities represents the earlier  
of the first call date, the next interest reset date or the ultimate maturity   
date.                                                                           

ABBREVIATIONS:

                              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2002

1.   ORGANIZATION OF THE FUNDS                                                  
The GE S&S Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund, formerly named GES&S Long
Term Interest Fund, (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds") are registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act") as       
open-end management investment companies. The Funds are two of the investment   
options offered under the GE Savings & Security Program (the "Program"). The    
Program, through a trust, owns 60% of the GE S&S Program Mutual Fund and 69% of 
the GE S&S Income Fund. The Funds operate as Employees' Securities Companies (as
defined in the 1940 Act) and as such are exempt from certain provisions of the  
1940 Act.                                                                       

GE Asset Management Incorporated (GEAM) is the Funds' investment adviser and a  
wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company.                            

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT                                                     
ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                                   
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make  
estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. Actual       
results may differ from those estimates.                                        

The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Funds:      

SECURITY VALUATION AND TRANSACTIONS                                             
Securities for which exchange (or NASDAQ) quotations are readily available are  
valued at the last sale price, or if no sales occurred on that day, at the last 
quoted bid price. Certain fixed income securities are valued by a dealer or by a
pricing service based upon a matrix system, which considers market transactions 
and dealer supplied valuations. Short-term investments maturing within sixty    
days are valued at amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both  
of which approximate current value. Fund positions that cannot be valued as set 
forth above are valued at fair value determined in good faith under procedures  
approved by the Board of Trustees of the Funds. Security transactions are       
accounted for as of the trade date. Realized gains or losses on investments sold
are recorded on the basis of identified cost for both financial statement and   
federal tax purposes.                                                           

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                                           
Each of the Funds may enter into repurchase agreements. The Funds' custodian    
takes possession of the collateral pledged for investments in repurchase        
agreements on behalf of the Funds. The Funds value the underlying collateral    
daily on a mark-to-market basis to determine that the value, including accrued  
interest, is at least equal to 102% of the repurchase price. In the event the   
seller defaults and the value of the security declines, or if the seller enters 
an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by the Funds may be     
delayed or limited.                                                             

SECURITY LENDING                                                                
Each of the Funds may loan securities to brokers, dealers, and financial        
institutions determined by GEAM to be creditworthy, subject to certain          
limitations. The Funds continue to receive the interest and dividends on the    
loaned securities during the term of the loan. The loans of securities are      
secured by collateral in the form of cash or other liquid assets, which are     
segregated and maintained with the custodian in an amount at least equal to 102%
of the current market value of the loaned securities. During the term of the    
loan, the Funds will record any gain or loss in the market value of its loaned  
securities and of securities in which cash collateral is invested net of any    
rebate. In the event the counterparty (borrower) does not meet its contracted   
obligation to return the securities, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of    
loss of reacquiring the loaned securities at prevailing market prices using the 
proceeds of the sale of the collateral.                                         

FOREIGN CURRENCY                                                                
Accounting records of the Funds are maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment      
securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency   
are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period  
end. Purchases and sales of securities, income receipts and expense payments    
denom

inated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing 
exchange rate on the respective dates of such transactions.                     

The Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting    
from changes in foreign exchange rates from the fluctuations arising from       
changes in market prices of securities during the period. Such fluctuations are 
included in net realized or unrealized gain or loss from investments.           

Net realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions represent net     
gains or losses on sales and maturities of foreign currency contracts,          
disposition of foreign currencies, the difference between the amount of net     
investment income and withholding taxes accrued and the U.S. dollar amount      
actually received and paid, and gains or losses between the trade and settlement
date on purchases and sales of securities. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains
and losses arising from changes in the value of other assets and liabilities as 
a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are included as increases or      
decreases in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on foreign currency related   
transactions.                                                                   

FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The GE S&S Income Fund may invest in interest rate, financial and stock or bond 
index futures contracts subject to certain limitations. The Fund may invest in  
futures contracts to manage its exposure to the stock and bond markets and      
fluctuations in currency values. Buying futures tends to increase a Fund's      
exposure to the underlying instrument while selling futures tends to decrease a 
Fund's exposure to the underlying instrument, or hedge other Fund investments.  
The Fund will not enter into a transaction involving futures for speculative    
purposes. The Fund's risks in using these contracts include changes in the value
of the underlying instruments, non-performance of the counterparties under the  
contracts' terms and changes in the liquidity of the secondary market for the   
contracts. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each
day by the board of trade or exchange on which they principally trade.          

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to pledge to the    
broker an amount of cash and/or other assets equal to a certain percentage of   
the contract amount, known as initial margin deposit. Subsequent payments, known
as variation margin, are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on the
daily fluctuation in the fair value of the underlying security. The Fund records
an unrealized gain or loss equal to the daily variation margin. Should market   
conditions move unexpectedly, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits 
of the futures contracts and may incur a loss. The Funds recognize a realized   
gain or loss on the expiration or closing of a futures contract.                

OPTIONS                                                                         
The GE S&S Income Fund may purchase and write options, subject to certain       
limitations. The Fund may invest in options contracts to manage its exposure to 
the stock and bond markets and fluctuations in foreign currency values. Writing 
puts and buying calls tend to increase a Fund's exposure to the underlying      
instrument while buying puts and writing calls tend to decrease a Fund's        
exposure to the underlying instrument, or hedge other Fund investments. The Fund
will not enter into a transaction involving options for speculative purposes.   
The Fund's risks in using these contracts include changes in the value of the   
underlying instruments, non-performance of the counterparties under the         
contracts' terms and changes in the liquidity of the secondary market for the   
contracts. Options are valued at the last sale price, or if no sales occurred on
that day, at the last quoted bid price.                                         

When a Fund writes an option, the amount of the premium received is recorded as 
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options that expire unexercised are     
treated by the Funds on the expiration date as realized gains from investments. 
The difference between the premium and the amount paid on effecting a closing   
purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated as a     
realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the closing   
purchase, as a

realized loss. When an option is exercised, the proceeds from the sale of the   
underlying security or the cost basis of the securities purchased is adjusted by
the original premium received or paid.                                          

SWAP CONTRACTS 
The GE S&S Income Fund may invest in swap agreements. A swap agreement is an    
agreement to exchange the return generated by one instrument for the return     
generated by another instrument. The Funds may enter into total return swaps as 
part of their investment strategies. Total return swap agreements involve       
commitments to pay interest in exchange for a market linked return based upon a 
notional principal amount. To the extent the total return of the security or    
index underlying the agreement exceeds or falls short of the offsetting interest
rate obligation, the Fund will receive a payment from or make a payment to the  
counterparty. Swaps are marked to market daily based upon the underlying        
security or index. Payments received or made are recorded as realized gain or   
loss in the Statement of Operations. Entering into swap agreements involves, to 
varying degrees, elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amounts    
recognized on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the   
possibility that there will be no liquid market for these agreements, that the  
counterparty to the agreements may default on its obligation to perform and that
there may be unfavorable changes in the value of the index or securities        
underlying the agreement. Notional principal amounts are used to express the    
extent of involvement in these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject
to credit risk are much smaller.                                                

WHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES AND FORWARD COMMITMENTS                                  
Each of the Funds may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued or forward   
commitment basis. These transactions are arrangements in which the Funds        
purchase and sell securities with payment and delivery scheduled a month or more
after entering into the transactions. The price of the underlying securities and
the date when these securities will be delivered and paid for are fixed at the  
time the transaction is negotiated. Losses may arise due to changes in the      
market value of the underlying securities or if the counterparty does not       
perform under the commitment. In connection with such purchases, the Funds      
maintain cash or liquid assets in an amount equal to purchase commitments for   
such underlying securities until settlement date and for sales commitments the  
Funds maintain equivalent deliverable securities as "cover" for the transaction.
Unsettled commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying  
security. Daily fluctuations in the value of such commitments are recorded as   
unrealized gains or losses. The Funds will not enter into such commitments for  
the purpose of investment leverage.                                             

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
The GE S&S Income Fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange         
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign denominated securities and to   
manage the Fund's currency exposure. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts
are valued at the mean between the bid and the offered forward rates as last    
quoted by a recognized dealer. The aggregate principal amounts of the contracts 
are not recorded in the Fund's financial statements. Fluctuations in the value  
of the contracts are recorded in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an  
asset (or liability) and in the Statement of Operations as unrealized           
appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are closed, when they are       
recorded as realized gains or losses on foreign currency related transactions.  
The Fund's risks in using these contracts include changes in the value of       
foreign currency or the possibility that the counterparties do not perform under
the contracts' terms. When a Fund enters into a forward foreign currency        
exchange contract, it is required to segregate cash or liquid securities with   
its custodian in an amount equal to the value of the Fund's total assets        
committed to the consummation of the forward contract. If the value of the      
segregated securities declines, additional cash or securities is segregated so  
that the value of the account will equal the amount of the Fund's commitment    
with respect to the contract.

INCOME TAXES

The Funds intend to comply with all sections of the Internal Revenue Code       
applicable to regulated investment companies including the distribution of      
substantially all of their taxable net investment income and net realized       
capital gains to their shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income 
tax has been made. Each Fund is treated as a separate taxpayer for federal      
income tax purposes.                                                            

At December 31, 2002, information on the tax components of capital is as        
follows:

As of December 31, 2002, each Fund has a capital loss carryover as indicated    
below. The capital loss carryover is available to offset future realized capital
gains to the extent provided in the Internal Revenue Code and regulations       
thereunder. To the extent that this carryover loss is used to offset future     
capital gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not be distributed  
to shareholders because they would be taxable as ordinary income. During the    
year ended December 31, 2002, GE S&S Income Fund utilized approximately $39,600 
of capital loss carryover.

Any net capital and currency losses incurred after October 31, within each      
Fund's tax year, are deemed to arise on the first day of the Fund's next tax    
year if the Fund so elects to defer such losses.                                

The following Fund has elected to defer losses incurred after October 31, 2002  
as follows:

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                   
GE S&S Income Fund declares investment income dividends daily and pays them     
monthly. The GE S&S Program Mutual Fund declares and pays dividends from        
investment income annually. The Funds declare and pay net realized capital gains
in excess of capital loss carryforwards distributions annually. The character of
income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax  
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.     
These differences include (but are not limited to) swaps and treatment of       
realized gains and losses on foreign currency contracts. Reclassifications are  
made to the Funds' capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for   
distribution (or available capital loss carryovers) under income tax            
regulations. These reclassifications have no impact on net investment income,   
real

ized gains or losses, or net asset value of the Funds. The calculation of net   
investment income per share in the Financial Highlights table excludes these    
adjustments.                                                                    

INVESTMENT INCOME                                                               
Corporate actions (including cash dividends) are recorded on the ex-dividend    
date, net of applicable withholding taxes, except for certain foreign corporate 
actions, which are recorded as soon after ex-dividend date as such information  
becomes available. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All        
discounts and premiums on taxable bonds are accreted to call or maturity date,  
whichever is shorter, using the effective yield method.                         

EXPENSES                                                                        
Expenses of the Funds which are directly identifiable to a specific Fund are    
allocated to that Fund. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to a       
specific Fund are allocated in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into   
consideration the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the      
Funds. All expenses of the Funds are paid by GEAM, and reimbursed by the Funds. 

3.   LINE OF CREDIT                                                             
Effective December 18, 2002, and expiring December 17, 2003, the Funds share a  
revolving credit facility of up to $50 million with a number of their           
affiliates. The credit facility is with their custodian bank, State Street Bank 
and Trust Company. The revolving credit facility requires the payment of a      
commitment fee equal to 0.09% per annum on the daily unused portion of the      
credit facility, payable quarterly. The portion borne by the Funds generally is 
borne proportionally based upon net assets. Generally, borrowings under the     
credit facility would accrue interest at the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis   
points and is borne by the borrowing Fund. The maximum amount allowed to be     
borrowed by any one Fund is the lesser of its prospectus limitation, 20% of its 
net assets, or $50 million. The credit facility was not utilized by the Funds   
during the year ended December 31, 2002.

ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION FEES                                                
During 2002, the Funds incurred expenses for the cost of services rendered by   
GEAM as investment adviser and for services GEAM rendered as shareholder        
servicing agent. These expenses are included as administrative expenses and     
shareholder servicing agent fees in the Statements of Operations. The Trustees  
received no compensation as trustees for the Funds. Effective January 1, 2002,  
General Electric Capital International Services, an indirectly owned subsidiary 
of General Electric Company ("GECIS") began performing certain accounting and   
certain administration services not provided by GEAM. For the year ending       
December 31, 2002 $127,042 was charged to the Funds and was allocated pro rata  
across funds based upon relative net assets. Administrative services not        
performed by GEAM or GECIS were provided by an unaffiliated service provider.

KPMG [LOGO OMITTED]                                                             
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS                                          
GE S&S FUNDS:                                                                   

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the GE 
S&S Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund (formerly the GE S&S Long Term   
Interest Fund) (the "Funds"), including the schedules of investments, as of     
December 31, 2002, and the related statements of operations for the year then   
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the     
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years  
in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial    
highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility  
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights 
based on our audits.                                                            

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2002, by correspondence with the custodian. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GE S&S
Program Mutual Fund and GE S&S Income Fund as of December 31, 2002, the results 
of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for
each of the years in the two-year period then ended, and their financial        
highlights for each of the years in the five-year period then ended, in         
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Participants who can tolerate a significant degree of price fluctuation and

This investment option may be most useful for those participants who have

INVESTMENT OVERVIEW                                                             
This investment option provides participants with the opportunity to invest in  
shares of GE Common Stock and share in GE's long-term growth and dividend       
payouts.                                                                        

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 
The principal risk of investing in GE Common Stock is STOCK MARKET RISK. An     
investment in the stock of any company, including GE, may be subject to greater 
market volatility than an investment alternative that holds a diversified       
portfolio of securities. The value of your investment may be worth more or less 
than your original investment. In addition, GE's Board of Directors may increase
or decrease the rate of dividends paid on GE Common Stock at any time.          

VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   
Holders of GE Common Stock through the Program have the same voting rights as   
all other GE share owners. They will receive proxy statements, annual reports   
and other share owner information that is sent to all share owners. Participants
who have mailboxes on GE's e-mail system may, however, receive instructions for 
accessing the proxy statement and annual report on GE's website, instead of     
receiving these documents in hard copy, unless they specifically request hard   
copies. There are no restrictions on the exercise of voting, tender or similar  
rights in connection with a participant's investment in GE Common Stock.        

The policy of the Trustees is to keep information relating to GE Common Stock   
transactions and voting confidential. The Trustees are responsible for          
monitoring compliance with the procedures established to provide for the        
confidentiality of this information. The Trustees may be contacted c/o GE Asset 
Management, 3003 Summer Street, Stamford, CT 06904 Attn: S&SP Trustees or by    
phone at (203) 326-2300.

Strategies and Risks" later in this Disclosure Statement.

INVESTMENT OVERVIEW                                                             
The Bonds available under this option are Series "EE" Savings Bonds issued by   
the U.S. Treasury. The Bonds mature 30 years after their issue date. They earn  
interest based on market yields for Treasury securities. Each May 1 and November
1, the U.S. Government sets the rates for the Bonds that apply for the next six 
months. Principal and accrued interest are paid when the bond is redeemed or on 
its maturity date. A three-month interest penalty will apply to Bonds redeemed  
before five years from the date of purchase.                                    

Only after-tax employee contributions can be used to purchase Bonds through the 
Program.                                                                        

PRINCIPAL RISKS                                                                 
Interest rates applied to the Bonds are based upon interest rates of certain    
Treasury securities. In general, when interest rates on Treasury securities     
fall, the rate of return on the Bonds will follow. The principal of your        
investment in the Bonds is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.      
Government.

STRATEGIES AND RISKS                                                            
A. IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS                                                        

This section defines important terms that may be unfamiliar to an investor
reading about the investment alternatives. The Program Mutual Fund, Income Fund,
ST Interest Fund and Money Market Fund are referred to in this Disclosure       
Statement individually as a "Fund" and collectively as the "Funds".             

 ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES represent a participation in, or are secured by and
payable from, a stream of payments generated by particular assets, such as      
credit card receivables or auto loans.                                          

   BANK DEPOSITS are cash, checks or drafts deposited in a financial institution
for credit to a customer's account. Banks differentiate between demand deposits 
(checking accounts on which the customer may draw) and time deposits, which pay 
interest and have a specified maturity or require 30 days' notice before        
withdrawal.                                                                     

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS are highly liquid and highly rated instruments such
as COMMERCIAL PAPER and BANK DEPOSITS.                                          

 CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT include short-term DEBT SECURITIES issued by banks.

COMMERCIAL PAPER includes short-term DEBT SECURITIES issued by banks,     
corporations and other borrowers.                                               

  CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES may be DEBT or EQUITY SECURITIES that pay interest or
dividends or are sold at a discount and that may be converted on specified terms
into the stock of the issuer.                                                   

CORPORATE BONDS are DEBT SECURITIES issued by companies.                  

DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF SUPRANATIONAL AGENCIES are obligations of             
multi-jurisdictional agencies that operate across national borders (E.G., the   
World Bank).                                                                    

DEBT SECURITIES are bonds and other securities that are used by issuers to
borrow money from investors. Holders of debt securities have a higher priority  
claim to assets than do equity holders. Typically, the debt issuer pays the     
investor a fixed, variable or floating rate of interest and must repay the      
borrowed amount at maturity. Some DEBT SECURITIES, such as zero coupon bonds,   
are sold at a discount from their face values instead of paying interest.       

DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS represent interests in an account at a bank or trust  
company which holds equity securities. These interests may include American     
Depositary Receipts (held at U.S. banks and traded in the United States),       
European Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or other similar       
instruments.                                                                    

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES are securities whose values are based on other      
securities, currencies or indices and include options (on stocks, indices,      
currencies, futures contracts or bonds), forward currency exchange contracts,   
futures contracts, swaps, interest-only and principal-only DEBT SECURITIES,

                                             GE S&S PROGRAM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

  DURATION represents a mathematical calculation of the average life of a bond
(or portfolio of bonds) based on cash flows that serves as a useful measure of  
the security's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Each year of duration  
approximates an expected one percent change in the bond's price for every one   
percent change in the interest rate.                                            

   EQUITY SECURITIES may include common stocks, PREFERRED SECURITIES, DEPOSITARY
RECEIPTS, CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES, and RIGHTS and WARRANTS of U.S. and foreign   
companies. Stocks represent an ownership interest in a corporation.             

  EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS are deposits issued in U.S. dollars by foreign banks and
foreign branches of U.S. banks.                                                 

FLOATING AND VARIABLE RATE INSTRUMENTS are securities with floating or    
variable rates of interest or dividend payments.                                

 FOREIGN DEBT SECURITIES are issued by foreign corporations and governments.
They may include the following:                                                 

o Eurodollar Bonds, which are dollar-denominated securities issued outside
    the U.S. by foreign corporations and financial institutions and by foreign
branches of U.S. corporations and financial institutions              

o Yankee Bonds, which are dollar-denominated securities issued by foreign 
issuers in the U.S;                                                   

o Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.           

FOREIGN SECURITIES include interests in or obligations of entities located
outside of the United States. The determination of where an issuer of a security
is located will be made by reference to the country in which the issuer (a) is  
organized, (b) derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from goods       
produced or sold, investments made or services performed, (c) has at least 50%  
of its assets situated, or (d) has the principal trading market for its         
securities. FOREIGN SECURITIES may be denominated in non-U.S. currencies and    
traded outside the United States or may be in the form of DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS.  

   FORWARD CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS involve agreements to exchange one currency for
another at a future date.                                                       

FUTURES are agreements to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity,   
financial instrument or index at a particular price and future date. OPTIONS ON 
FUTURES give the purchaser the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume 
a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior
to the expiration date of the option.                                           

GOVERNMENT STRIPPED MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITIES are MORTGAGE-BACKED       
SECURITIES that have been separated into their interest and principal           
components. They represent interests in distributions of interest on or         
principal underlying mortgage-backed certificates.                              

GROWTH INVESTING involves buying stocks with above-average growth rates.  
Typically, growth stocks are the stocks of faster growing companies in more     
rapidly growing sectors of the economy. Generally, growth stock valuation levels
will be higher than those of value stocks and the market averages.              

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES are debt securities of corporations, preferred stock
and convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock rated Ba through C by     
Moody's or BB through D by S&P (or comparably rated by another nationally       
recognized statistical rating organization) or, if not rated by Moody's or S&P, 
are considered by portfolio management to be of equivalent quality. High yield  
securities include bonds rated below investment grade, sometimes called "junk   
bonds," and are considered speculative by the major credit rating agencies.     

 INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT SECURITIES are rated Baa or better by Moody's and BBB
or better by S&P or are comparably rated by another nationally recognized       
statistical rating organization, or, if not rated, are of similar quality to    
such securities. Securities rated in the fourth highest grade have some         
speculative elements.                                                           

MATURITY represents the date on which a DEBT SECURITY matures or when the 
issuer must pay back the principal amount of the security.                      

MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS are short-term debt securities of the U.S.       
government, banks and corporations. The Funds that may invest in MONEY MARKET   
INSTRUMENTS may do so directly or indirectly through investments in the GEI     
Short-Term Investment Fund. The GEI Short-Term Investment Fund is advised by

                                             GE S&S PROGRAM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

GE Asset Management Incorporated ("GEAM"), which charges no advisory fee for    
such services.                                                                  

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES include securities issued by the Government    
National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage       
Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie   
Mac) and other government agencies and private issuers. They may also include   
collateralized mortgage obligations which are DERIVATIVE SECURITIES that are    
fully collateralized by a portfolio of mortgages.                               

MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS are transactions involving the sale of a            
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITY with a simultaneous contract (with the purchaser) to   
buy similar, but not identical, securities at a future date.                    

 PREFERRED SECURITIES are classes of stock that pay dividends at a specified
rate. Dividends are paid on preferred stocks before they are paid on common     
stocks. In addition, preferred stockholders have priority over common           
stockholders as to the proceeds from the liquidation of a company's assets.     

PURCHASING AND WRITING OPTIONS are permitted investment strategies for    
certain Funds. An option is the right to buy (I.E., a "call") or sell (I.E., a  
"put") securities or other interests for a predetermined price on or before a   
fixed date. An OPTION ON A SECURITIES INDEX represents the option holder's right
to obtain from the seller, in cash, a fixed multiple of the amount by which the 
exercise price exceeds (in the case of a put) or is less than (in the case of a 
call) the closing value of the securities index on the exercise date. An OPTION 
ON A FOREIGN CURRENCY represents the right to buy or sell a particular amount of
that currency for a predetermined price on or before a fixed date.              

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, also known as repos, are used to invest cash on a  
short-term basis. A seller (bank or broker-dealer) sells securities, usually    
government securities, to the Fund, agreeing to buy them back at a designated   
price and time - usually the next day.                                          

RESTRICTED SECURITIES (which include Rule 144A securities) may have       
contractual restrictions on resale, or cannot be resold publicly until          
registered. Certain RESTRICTED SECURITIES may be illiquid. ILLIQUID SECURITIES  
may be difficult or impossible to sell when a Fund wants to sell them at a price
at which the Fund values them.                                                  

 REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, also known as reverse repos, involve selling
securities held and concurrently agreeing to repurchase the same securities at a
specified price and future date.                                                

RIGHTS represent a preemptive right of stockholders to purchase additional
shares of a stock at the time of a new issuance, before the stock is offered to 
the general public, allowing the stockholder to retain the same ownership       
percentage after the new stock offering.                                        

RULE 144A SECURITIES are RESTRICTED SECURITIES that may be sold to certain
institutional purchasers under Rule 144A.                                       

STRUCTURED AND INDEXED SECURITIES are securities whose principal and/or   
interest rate is determined by reference to changes in the value of one or more 
specific currencies, interest rates, commodities, indices or other financial    
indicators.                                                                     

U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES are issued or guaranteed as to principal or    
interest by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities.    
Some U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES are backed by the full faith and credit of the  
federal government. Other U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES are backed by the issuer's 
right to borrow from the U.S. Treasury and some are backed only by the credit of
the issuing organization. All U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES are considered highly  
creditworthy.                                                                   

VALUE INVESTING involves buying stocks that are out of favor and/or       
undervalued in comparison to their peers and/or their prospects for growth.     
Generally, value stock valuation levels are lower than those of growth stocks.  

VARIABLE RATE SECURITIES which include floating and variable rate         
instruments, carry interest rates that fluctuate or may be adjusted periodically
to market rates. Interest rate adjustments could increase or decrease the income
generated by the securities.                                                    

  VARIOUS INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES are utilized by a Fund to increase or decrease
its exposure to changing security prices, interest rates, currency exchange     
rates, commodity prices or other factors that affect security values. For       
certain Funds, these techniques                                                 

54

may involve DERIVATIVE SECURITIES and transactions such as buying and selling   
options and futures contracts, entering into currency exchange contracts or swap
agreements or contracts and purchasing indexed securities. These techniques are 
designed to adjust the risk and return characteristics of a Fund's portfolio of 
investments and are not used for leverage. No Fund is under any obligation to   
use any of these techniques at any given time or under any particular economic  
condition. To the extent that a Fund employs these techniques, it would be      
subject to DERIVATIVE SECURITIES RISK.                                          

WARRANTS are securities that are usually issued together with a bond or   
preferred stock, that permits the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common
stock at a specified price that is usually higher than the stock price at the   
time of issue.                                                                  

WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY represents the length of time in days or years  
until the average security in a money market or bond fund will mature or be     
redeemed by its issuer. The average maturity is weighted according to the dollar
amounts invested in the various securities in the fund. This measure indicates  
an income fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general, the      
longer a fund's average weighted maturity, the more its share price will        
fluctuate in response to changing interest rates.                               

   WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES are securities that are purchased
or sold for delivery and payment at a future date, I.E., beyond normal          
settlement date.                                                                

 ZERO COUPON OBLIGATIONS pay no interest to their holders prior to maturity.
Instead, interest is paid in a lump sum at maturity. They are purchased at a    
discount from par value, and generally are more volatile than other fixed income
securities.                                                                     

B. MORE INFORMATION ON INVESTMENT STRATEGIES                                    

In addition to the principal investment objectives and methods described  
earlier in this Disclosure Statement, each of the Program Mutual Fund, Income   
Fund, ST Interest Fund and Money Market Fund is permitted to use other          
securities, investment strategies and techniques in pursuit of its investment   
objective. No Fund is under any obligation to use any of these techniques or    
strategies at any given time or under any particular economic condition. Certain
instruments and investment strategies expose the Funds to other risks and       
considerations.                                                                 

 HOLDING CASH AND TEMPORARY DEFENSIVE POSITIONS: Under normal circumstances,
each Fund may hold CASH and/or MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS (i) pending investment, 
(ii) for cash management purposes, and (iii) to meet operating expenses, if any.
A Fund may from time to time take temporary defensive positions when the        
portfolio manager believes that adverse market, economic, political or other    
conditions exist. In these circumstances, the portfolio manager may (i) without 
limit hold CASH and CASH EQUIVALENTS and/or invest in MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, 
or (ii) restrict the securities markets in which a Fund's assets are invested by
investing those assets in securities markets deemed to be conservative in light 
of the Fund's investment objective and strategies.                              

To the extent that a Fund, other than the Money Market Fund, holds CASH or
invests in MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, it may not achieve its investment          
objective.                                                                      

  CASH MANAGEMENT OF THE INCOME AND ST INTEREST FUNDS: The Income Fund and the
ST Interest Fund may invest, directly or indirectly through investment in the   
GEI Short-Term Investment Fund (the "Investment Fund") described below, in the  
following types of MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS (i) securities issued or guaranteed 
by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities, (ii) debt   
obligations of U.S. banks, savings and loan institutions, insurance companies   
and mortgage bankers, (iii) COMMERCIAL PAPER and notes, including those with    
variable and floating rates of interest, (iv) debt obligations of foreign       
branches of U.S. banks, U.S. branches of foreign banks and foreign branches of  
foreign banks, (v) debt obligations issued or guaranteed by one or more foreign 
governments or any of their political subdivisions, agencies or                 
instrumentalities, including obligations of supranational entities, (vi) DEBT   
SECURITIES issued by foreign issuers and (vii) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The       
Investment Fund was created specifically to serve as a vehicle for the          
collective investment of cash balances of the ST Interest Fund and the Income   
Fund and other accounts advised by GE Asset Management ("GEAM"). By using the   
Investment Fund, each Fund's cash position is exposed to potentially broader    
diversification, lower transaction cost and better investment opportunity than  
would be the case if it were invested sep-

arately without the potential benefits of such a large cash pool.               

The Investment Fund invests exclusively in the money market instruments   
described in (i) through (vii) above. The Investment Fund is advised by GEAM. No
advisory fee is charged by GEAM to the Investment Fund, nor will a Fund incur   
any sales charge, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee in connection 
with its investments in the Investment Fund.                                    

Although, during normal market conditions, the uninvested cash balances of
the ST Interest Fund and the Income Fund are generally expected to be relatively
small, the ST Interest Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in the Investment
Fund if the size of the cash balance so warrants.                               

  The following table summarizes some of the investment techniques that may be
employed by a Fund. Certain techniques may be changed at the discretion of GEAM.

                                             GE S&S PROGRAM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

C. MORE INFORMATION ON RISKS                                                    

This section defines important risk terms that are used in this Disclosure
Statement. In addition, be aware that an investment in any one or more          
investment options under the Program should not be considered to be a complete  
investment program.                                                             

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES RISK:                                                   
  Asset-backed securities often are subject to more rapid repayment than their
stated maturity dates indicate, due to changing economic conditions. To maintain
its position in such securities, a Fund may reinvest the reductions in principal
amounts resulting from the prepayments. Yields on those reinvested amounts are  
subject to prevailing market rates. Because prepayments of principal generally  
increase when rates are falling, a Fund generally has to reinvest proceeds from 
prepayments at lower rates. Also, because ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES often are     
secured by the loans underlying the securities, a Fund may lose money if there  
are defaults in the loans underlying the securities.                            

CREDIT RISK:                                                                    
The price of a bond is affected by the issuer's or counterparty's credit  
quality. Changes in financial condition and general economic conditions can     
affect the ability to honor financial obligations and therefore credit quality. 
Lower quality bonds are generally more sensitive to these changes than higher   
quality bonds. Even within securities considered investment grade, differences  
exist in credit quality and some INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT SECURITIES may have      
speculative characteristics. A security's price may be adversely affected by the
market's opinion of the security's credit quality level even if the issuer or   
counterparty has suffered no degradation in ability to honor the obligation.    

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES RISK:                                                     
A Fund's use of VARIOUS INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES may involve DERIVATIVE      
SECURITIES, such as options, futures and options on futures. A Fund may, but is 
not required to, use derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in an    
underlying asset, to increase returns, or as part of a hedging strategy. A small
investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on a Fund's     
performance. The use of derivatives is speculative and involves risks different 
from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in 
the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid, subject to 
counterparty risk and difficult to value, and there is the risk that changes in 
the value of a derivative held by a Fund will not correlate with a Fund's other 
investments. A Fund may chose not to invest in DERIVATIVE SECURITIES because    
they may not be available, may be too costly to be used effectively or may be   
unable to be used for other reasons.                                            

FOREIGN EXPOSURE RISK:                                                          
   Investing in foreign securities, including DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS, or securities
of U.S. entities with significant foreign operations, involves additional risks 
which can affect a Fund's performance. Foreign markets, particularly emerging   
markets, may be less liquid, more volatile and subject to less government       
supervision than U.S. markets. There may be difficulties enforcing contractual  
obligations, and it may take more time for transactions to clear and settle in  
foreign countries than in the U.S. Less information may be available about      
foreign issuers. The costs of buying and selling foreign securities, including  
tax, brokerage and custody costs, generally are higher than those involving     
domestic transactions. The specific risks of investing in foreign securities    
include:                                                                        

 CURRENCY RISK: The values of foreign investments may be affected by changes
in currency rates or exchange control regulations. If the local currency gains  
strength against the U.S. dollar, the value of the foreign security increases in
U.S. dollar terms. Conversely, if the local currency weakens against the U.S.   
dollar, the value of the foreign security declines in U.S. dollar terms. U.S.   
dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers, including DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,
also are subject to currency risk based on their related investments.           

POLITICAL/ECONOMIC RISK: Changes in economic, tax or foreign investment   
policies, government stability, war or other political or economic actions may  
have an adverse effect on a Fund's foreign investments.                         

REGULATORY RISK: Foreign companies often are not subject to uniform       
accounting, auditing and finan-

cial reporting standards or to other regulatory practices and requirements      
common to U.S. companies.                                                       

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES RISK:                                                     
Below investment grade securities, sometimes called "junk bonds," are     
considered speculative. These securities have greater risk of default than      
higher rated securities. The market value of below investment grade securities  
is more sensitive to individual corporate developments and economic changes than
higher rated securities. The market for below investment grade securities may be
less active than for higher rated securities, which can adversely affect the    
price at which these securities may be sold. Less active markets may diminish a 
Fund's ability to obtain accurate market quotations when valuing the portfolio  
securities and calculating a Fund's net asset value. In addition, a Fund may    
incur additional expenses if a holding defaults and a Fund has to seek recovery 
of its principal investment.                                                    

Below investment grade securities may also present risks based on payment 
expectations. For example, these securities may contain redemption or call      
provisions. If an issuer exercises these provisions in a declining interest rate
market the Fund would have to replace the security with a lower yielding        
security resulting in a decreased return for investors.                         

ILLIQUID SECURITIES RISK:                                                       
 Companies with non-publicly traded securities are not subject to disclosure
and other investor protection requirements and may be less liquid than publicly 
traded securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to resell at            
approximately the price they are valued in the ordinary course of business in   
seven days or less. When investments cannot be sold readily at the desired time 
or price, a Fund may have to accept a lower price or may not be able to sell the
security at all, or forego other investment opportunities, all of which may have
an impact on the Fund.                                                          

INTEREST RATE RISK:                                                             
Bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and decline when   
interest rates rise. The longer the duration of a bond, the more a change in    
interest rates affects the bond's price. Short-term and long-term interest rates
may not move the same amount and may not move in the same direction.            

PREPAYMENT RISK:                                                                
   Prices and yields of MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES assume the securities will be
redeemed at a given time. When interest rates decline, MORTGAGE-BACKED          
SECURITIES experience higher prepayments because the underlying mortgages are   
repaid earlier than expected. A Fund's portfolio manager may be forced to invest
the proceeds from prepaid MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES at lower rates, which      
results in a lower return for the Fund. When interest rates increase,           
MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES experience lower prepayments because the underlying  
mortgages may be repaid later than expected. This typically reduces the value of
the underlying securities.                                                      

REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE                                               
AGREEMENTS RISK:                                                                
A Fund entering into a REPURCHASE AGREEMENT may suffer a loss if the other
party to the transaction defaults on its obligations and could be delayed or    
prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the underlying securities.   
The value of the underlying securities might decline while the Fund seeks to    
assert its rights. The Fund could incur additional expenses in asserting its    
rights or may lose all or part of the income from the agreement. A REVERSE      
REPURCHASE AGREEMENT involves the risk that the market value of the securities  
retained by a Fund may decline below the price of the securities the Fund has   
sold but is obligated to repurchase at a higher price under the agreement.      

RESTRICTED SECURITIES RISK:                                                     
RESTRICTED SECURITIES (including RULE 144A SECURITIES) may be subject to  
legal restraints on resale and, therefore, are typically less liquid than other 
securities. The prices received from reselling RESTRICTED SECURITIES in         
privately negotiated transactions may be less than those originally paid by a   
Fund. Companies whose securities are restricted are not subject to the same     
investor protection requirements as publicly traded securities.

                                             GE S&S PROGRAM DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

STOCK MARKET RISK:                                                              
Stock market risk is the risk that the value of EQUITY SECURITIES may     
decline. Stock prices, including the price of GE Common Stock, change daily in  
response to company activity and general economic and market conditions. Stock  
prices may decline in value, even during periods when EQUITY SECURITIES in      
general are rising, or may not perform as well as the market in general.        
Additional stock market risks may be introduced when a particular EQUITY        
SECURITY is traded on a foreign market. For more detail on the related risks    
involved in foreign markets, see FOREIGN EXPOSURE RISK.                         

STYLE RISK:                                                                     
 Securities with different characteristics tend to shift in and out of favor
depending upon market and economic conditions as well as investor sentiment. A  
Fund may underperform other funds that employ a different style. A Fund also may
employ a combination of styles that impact its risk characteristics. Examples of
different styles include growth and value investing, as well as those focusing  
on large, medium, or small company securities.                                  

 GROWTH INVESTING RISK: Growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks
because they are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company's
growth potential. Growth oriented funds will typically underperform when value  
investing is in favor.                                                          

 MID-CAP COMPANY RISK: Investments in securities of mid-cap companies entail
greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap   
companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial        
resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with  
larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline significantly as  
market conditions change.                                                       

VALUE INVESTING RISK: Undervalued stocks may not realize their perceived  
value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value.  
Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other
types of stocks. Value oriented funds will typically underperform when growth   
investing is in favor.                                                          

D. INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

f. act as an underwriter of securities for other issuers except that such 
   Fund may acquire securities under circumstances where if they are later

transaction processing fees, are generally borne by GE. For GE Common Stock, ST 
Interest Fund, Money Market Fund and Bonds, all other expenses associated with  
these alternatives (including any investment management costs, shareholder      
servicing agent expenses, transfer agent fees, custody and accounting expenses,

borne by GE. These other expenses, however, come out of the Program Mutual      
Fund's and Income Fund's assets and are reflected in each Fund's share price and
dividends. For a description of these Funds' expenses, please refer to the      
Mutual Funds Annual Report, which is contained earlier in this document.        

Annual operating expense of the GE Institutional International Equity Fund,
