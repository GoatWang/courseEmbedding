Did you know that you only have to 
		hold a stock for one day to collect a dividend? That fact has inspired 
		many investors to pursue dividend capture strategies that involve 
		holding a stock just long enough to collect the dividend, selling at or 
		above their purchase price, and then moving on. 
 

Of course, its not that easy. For 
		starters, theoretically, the share price drops by the dividend amount on 
		the ex-dividend date. But, in fact, many different factors influence a 
		stocks price movements on any given day, and prices typically dont 
		drop by the exact dividend amount on the ex-date.  

Dividend Capture Definitions 


Here 
		are definitions that you need to know. 

Declaration date: the day that a firm announces its next dividend. 
      Such announcements are almost always made via a press release.  

Owner of Record date: the date that you must be registered as a shareholder 
      to collect the next dividend. You become the owner of record on the third 
		business day after you purchased the shares.  

Ex-dividend date: the first day that new buyers are not 
		entitled to collect the next dividend. The ex-dividend date is 

        two business days before the "owner of record" date 
        (business days are days when New York City banks are open, not 
      stock market days). In the case of very large dividends (at least 25% 
      of the share price), to collect the dividend, you cannot sell until at 
		least one market day after the 
      payment date.  

Payment date: the day that the dividend should be deposited into 
      your brokerage account.  

Thus, in most instances, you could purchase shares on the 
		day prior to the ex-dividend date, sell on the ex-dividend date, and still collect the dividend on the payment date.  

Traditional Dividend Capture Strategies

Traditional dividend capture strategies involve buying a stock before the ex-dividend date, 
		thus qualifying to collect the dividend, and then selling some time 
		later.  

Within that general framework, traditional dividend capture players 
		employ a variety of sub-strategies. Some try to buy before the dividend is announced, some 
			sell on the ex-date, while others wait for a stock to recover to a 
			predetermined price before selling. Dividend capture is a 
			controversial topic and not everybody believes that any capture 
			strategy will be consistently profitable.  

Dividend Capture Income Tax Implications

U.S. tax rules say that you must hold a stock a least 61 days to be 
      eligible for the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate. Consequently, some 
		dividend capture investors try to hold for that period before selling. 
		Alas, such strategies are generally unproductive. For starters, doing so would limit you to six 
      trades per year. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that your trade 
		would remain profitable after waiting that long.  

You can mitigate 
		these issues by limiting your dividend capture trades to tax-sheltered 
		accounts such as IRAs or Roth IRAs. If held in an ordinary IRA, 

dividends aren't taxed until you begin taking 
		distributions from that IRA. If held in a ROTH IRA, dividends are not 
		taxed at all.

DD's Advanced Dividend Capture 
Strategy


We have devised an Advanced Dividend Capture Strategy that we've found 
		produces better returns than the traditional strategies that we've tested. 

Advanced Dividend Capture Resources
Our Advanced 
		Dividend Capture Resources section includes everything you need to 
		implement our Advanced Capture Strategy including instructions on how to 
		implement the strategy and a special table that includes all needed 
		data. If you're already a DD Premium member, here's a

Special Dividend Resources
Special dividends are one-time payouts that that are often 
		much larger than regular dividends. For instance, regular quarterly 
		dividends typically amount to around 1% of a stocks trading price 
		compared to 3% or 4%, and sometimes much higher, for special 
		dividends. Those higher yields can translate to better profit 
		opportunities than regular dividends. D.D. Premium's Special Dividend 
		report lists all upcoming special dividends that we've evaluated as 
		investable, plus our recommended Special Dividend Trading Strategy. If you're already a Premium member, here's a link

REITs: A Way to Invest in 
		Commercial Real Estate


        Real estate investment trusts (REITs) enable individual investors to 
		participate in large-scale, income-producing real estate investments. 


        REITs are a special form of corporation 
        that, by law, must invest only in real estate. In return for following 
        that rule, a REIT does not have to pay U.S. federal income
        tax if it pays out at least 90% of its net income in the form of
        dividends to its shareholders (for the years 2009/2010, the IRS allowed 
        a REIT 
        to pay 90% of its dividends in stock rather than cash). 
To
        qualify as a REIT, a company must meet the following requirements:
  its assets must consist
            mostly of real estate held for long-term investment,
  its income must be
            mainly derived from real estate, and
  it must pay out at least
            90% of its taxable income to shareholders.

Equity REITs vs. Mortgage REITs

There
        are two major categories of REITs. Equity REITs own physical properties
        such as apartment houses or shopping centers. By contrast, mortgage
        REITs do not own real estate properties, instead, they invest in
        mortgages. Equity REITs may invest in any type of real estate, but most
        specialize in a particular property type. 
REITs: Pay 
		Attention to Funds From Operations (FFO) 

		When analyzing REITs, you need to know that that taxable income 
        is not necessarily the same as the net income shown in the quarterly or 
        annual financial statements. In fact, most REITs do not disclose their 
		taxable income reported to the IRS. 

		Actually, when it comes to analyzing a REIT's ability to pay dividends, 
		neither taxable income or financial statement net income means much. 

		That's because, in both instances, real estate property owners 
        must deduct non-cash depreciation expenses when they calculate income, even if the property is, in 
        fact, appreciating in value. Thus, neither the taxable income nor the 
		financial state numbers tell you anything about the cash available to 
		pay dividends. 
For that reason, the REIT trade association created a 
        measure called funds from operations (FFO), which reflects the actual cash 
        profits generated by a property REIT's operations. Almost all property 
		REITs include the funds from operations numbers in their quarterly 
		reports. 
More About 
		REITs 

		No matter how you count it, the federal rules require REITs to pay 
        out a large chunk of earnings to shareholders, leaving little to fund 
		expansion. Thus REITs must 
        raise capital by borrowing or by selling more shares to fund growth. 

        Property REITs are allowed to provide the customary management services 
        associated with leasing properties such as apartment buildings, shopping 
        centers and office buildings. But REITs are not allowed to operate real 
        estate that requires a high degree of personal service such as hotels 
        and healthcare facilities. However, property REITs
        can create affiliated companies that can provide management services. in
        these sectors.

REIT Categories
We have divided the 
		REIT universe into eleven categories:



Retail:
shopping centers, outlet centers, small neighborhood centers, or
            downtown/heavily trafficked retail locations. 


Healthcare:
            owners, but not operators, of healthcare facilities such as nursing
            homes, medical office buildings, hospitals, etc.


Lodging:
            hotels, motels, and resort properties. Since Lodging REITs are not allowed to
            directly manage their hotel operations, most hire nationally known 
			hotel operators such as Marriot or Westin to run their properties. 
			Those properties bear the name of the management company, not the 
			property owner. 


Industrial:
            industrial, warehouse, distribution center, or flex properties. Flex
            properties, a recent innovation,
            are single-story buildings that could be configured as needed to be 
			used as office, light
            manufacturing and/or warehouse space. 


Office:
            office buildings are generally categorized as Class A, Class B, or
            Class C, depending on amenities and location. Class A, typically 
			located in downtown or upscale areas, are the
            best. Class B buildings are usually in suburban neighborhoods. Class
            C buildings are typically older and in low-rent areas.


Mixed
            Industrial/Office: these REITs own both office and
            industrial/warehouse properties.


Mortgage/Finance:
            REITs that invest in existing mortgages, or offer new mortgages or
            other types of financing.


Residential:
            apartment and manufactured home community owners.


Digital 
			Infrastructure: 

			Computer data centers, telecomm towers operators, and communications 
			networks.


Specialty:
            self-storage centers, restaurant property owners, and other REITs
            that do not fit into the major categories.


Diversified:
            REITs that own properties in multiple categories.


REIT Income Tax Considerations

REIT dividends are mostly taxed at ordinary income tax rates. However, 
        after the year-end, a REIT may designate a portion of its prior year's 
        payouts as "qualified dividends," which qualify for the maximum 15%/20% 
        rate.  On average, roughly 20% of annual payouts fall into this 
        category. A REIT may also classify portions of its prior year payouts as 
        return of capital. Return of capital payouts 
        reduce your cost basis and are not taxable until you sell your REIT 
        shares, when they are taxed at the appropriate capital gains rate.

Preferred Stocks 
Primer  
 

While money market funds are paying 
		next to nothing, 
		many preferred stocks
		are paying 5% to 8%.  



Preferred Stocks Basics 

Corporations issue preferred stocks to raise cash. 
		Although you buy or sell them the same way you trade regular stocks, 
		preferreds are more like bonds than common stocks. Investors buy them 
		for the steady dividends, which typically equate to 4% to 8% yields. 
		Most preferreds pay dividends quarterly.  

Unlike common stocks, youre wont enjoy much share price 
		appreciation if your company comes up with a hot product. Further, in 
		most cases, the dividend never goes up either.

        The term preferred means that a firm must pay the dividends due on its 
        preferred shares before it pays any common stock dividends. 
        Also, in theory, if a company goes bankrupt, preferred holders have 
        priority over common stock shareholders. However, when a company fails, 
        both common and preferred shareholders usually get nothing. 

        Finally, another meaningless distinction: unlike common stock holders, 
        preferred shareholders dont get to vote on company proposals. But, in 
        fact, individual common shareholders have almost no influence on any 
        corporation's policies. 

Preferred Stocks: What You Need to Know

        When a company issues a preferred stock, it sets the annual dividend and 
        sells the shares at a preset price, typically $25, but some are also  issued 
        at $10, $50 or $100. 

        The initial yield, called the coupon rate, is the annual dividend 
        divided by the issue price. For instance, the yield on shares paying 
        $1/year on shares issued at $25 is 4%. 

        However, since preferreds trade on the open market just like 
        regular stocks, the actual trading price depends on supply and demand. 
        Thus, if the shares mentioned above slip to $24, the yield to new 
        investors (market yield) rises to 4.2% ($1 divided by $24).  

Preferred Stock Ticker Symbols

        Companies that issue preferred stocks typically sell more than one 
        series, for instance, Series A, Series B, etc. Ticker symbols are not 
		standardized and vary from site to site. However they typically start 
		with the issuer's common stock symbol and end with the series 
		designator. For instance, the ticker for Bank of America (BAC) Series N 
		preferreds might be BAC-N, BAC-PN, BACPRN, etc. To find the ticker on a 
		particular site, use the symbol lookup function and enter the common 
		stock ticker. Most sites respond with a list of all tickers starting 
		with those letters. From that list, find the ticker ending with the 
		desired series designator. After you've done it once, you'll probably be 
		able to find additional preferreds on the same site without needing the 
		lookup function.

Calling Preferreds

        Preferreds have minimum 30-year maturities and some are perpetual, 
        meaning that the firm is not obligated to redeem them. However, most 
        preferred stocks are callable, meaning that the issuer has the right 
        to call (redeem) them at the call price after a specified date (call 
        date), typically five-years after issue. The call price is usually as the 
        original issue price, but in some instances is slightly 
        higher. 

        The issuer is not obligated to redeem the shares at the call 
        date. Issuers are likely to call their preferreds if interest rates have 
        dropped and they can save money by calling existing preferreds and 
        selling a new batch paying lower rates. Thus, depending on prevailing 
        interest rates, preferreds might continue to trade for years after the 
        call date.

Preferred Stock Returns

Preferred Stock Dividend Yield

        A preferred stock's coupon rate defines its annual dividend, but not the yield 
        that you would receive if you bought the preferreds after the issue 
        date. For instance, A 7.0% bond issued at $25 pays $1.75/share annually 
        (7% of $25). If the price drops and you only pay $23.00 per share, your 
        nominal yield would be 7.6% ($1.75 divided by $23). On the other hand,  
        your yield would drop to 6.7% if you pay $26 for the shares, which still 
        might be acceptable, depending on what banks are paying at the time. 

Preferred Stock Yield to Call   

        For preferreds near or already past their call dates, its important to 
        know your potential return should they be called. For instance, say that 
        you pay $26 per share for 7.0% (coupon rate) preferreds originally 
        issued at $25 per share that can be called in 12-months.  Even 
        though you're collecting a nominal 6.7% yield, you would lose $1/share 
        in 12-months if the shares were called at that time. Factoring that in, 
        your actual return, called the "yield to call," would drop to 2.9%. 
        Rather than doing the math yourself, use this
        
        handy calculator to determine your preferred's yield to call. 

Potential Price Appreciation

        Ideally, you would like to buy preferreds below their issue 
        price. Assuming that the issuing corporation is a solid player and won't 
        renege on its dividend obligations, the preferreds will eventually move 
        back up to their issue price. If that happens, you would enjoy capital 
        appreciation in addition to the dividends. For instance, suppose that 
        you buy shares originally issued at $25, but currently trading at $23. 
        Your capital appreciation potential is 8.7%., and your nominal dividend 
        yield is 7.6%. 

        Obviously, thanks to the capital appreciation potential, the call date 
        isn't an issue when you buy preferreds trading below their call price. 
        For example, for the 7.0% coupon preferreds trading at $23, your yield 
        to maturity would be 16.3% if they were called 12-months after you 
        purchased. In practice, though, most companies wouldn't call preferreds 
		trading significantly below their call prices. Instead, they would 
		simply buy them on the open market if they wanted to redeem them.




        Preferred 

        Stock 

		Risks 


        Preferred stock investors face three major risk factors: 1) dividend 
        suspension or company failure, 2) rising interest rates, and 3) low 
        trading volumes.  

Preferred Dividend Suspension/Company Failure

        Firms that are facing cash flow problems will be tempted to suspend 
        paying preferred stock dividends, and in the worst case, might file for 
        bankruptcy. Either of those events would sink preferred share prices. 

        Consequently, preferred investors must understand the issuing 
        corporation's fundamental outlook. Preferreds issued by marginal 
        corporations will look tempting because they will be 
        trading at big discounts to their issue price. Thus, be sure to do your 
        homework before buying preferreds in that category. 

        Many preferred stocks are rated by bond rating agencies such as Moody's and 
        Standard & Poor's. They use a combination of letters, numbers, and plus 
        or minus signs such as AAA, BA1 or B- to rate the preferreds.
        The details vary between agencies, but all ratings starting with A, and 
        three letter ratings starting with B, indicate investment quality. 

S&P: 
          Investment quality ratings are AAA, AA, A, and BBB. Below investment 
          quality ( best to worst) are BB, 
        B, CCC, CC, C and D. S&P may add a + or - to indicate 
        that a rating falls near the top or bottom of a rating category. 
Moodys 
          investment quality ratings, are Aaa, Aa, A, and Baa. Below investment 
          quality (best to worst) are Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C. Moodys may add a 1, 2, or 3 to a rating 
        to indicate that it falls near the top or bottom of a rating category (1 
        is best). 


        Since issuers must pay Moodys or S&P to be rated, not all preferreds 
        are rated. Unrated preferreds arent necessarily risky, but they require 
        more work since youll have to do the financial strength analysis on 
        your own. 

        Beware; bond-analysts sometimes overlook the obvious. For instance, in 
        2007, many didnt realize that falling home prices would 
        reduce the value of mortgages secured by those homes. Thus, its up to 
        you to keep up with the news and avoid industries with obvious problems.
        

Preferred Interest Rate Risk

        After the issuing company's financial outlook, prevailing interest rates are the most important factor controlling 
        preferred share prices. If market rates rise, preferred stock prices will 
        probably drop, and vice versa. Heres why.

        Suppose that you own preferreds paying an initial 6% dividend yield; for 
        instance, a preferred issued at $25 that pays dividends totaling $1.50 
        annually. Now, say that prevailing corporate rates rise to 7%. There 
        would be no market for preferreds paying 6% at $25 per share. Instead, 
        buyers would only be willing pay $21.43 per share. At that price, the 
        $1.50 annual dividend would equate to a 7% return ($1.50 divided by 
        $21.43 is 7%). 

        Conversely, if interest rates drop, investors would be willing to pay 
        more for you shares because they are yielding better than market 
        returns. Thus, the best time to own preferreds is when the outlook for 
        corporate 
        interest rates is steady or headed down. 

Trading Volumes

        Some preferred stocks are not widely followed and are lightly traded. 
        Those are risky business because the lack of trading volume makes it 
        difficult to move in or out of a position at a reasonable price. Avoid 
        preferred stocks trading less than 4,000 shares daily, on average. 


Preferred 
Stock 
Tax 
Issues
 

        For reasons too involved to detail here, the dividends from some 
        preferreds are subject to the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate, while 
        others are taxed as ordinary income. That can make a big difference. For 
        instance, $1.00 of dividends taxed at 15% nets out to roughly the same 
        amount as $1.30 taxed at the maximum 35% ordinary tax rate. For each 
        preferred, Quantum Online (www.quantumonline.com) 
        specifies whether the 15%/20% maximum rate applies. 

        Corporations that have invested in other firms preferred shares, in 
        most instances, enjoy a dividend received deduction that allows them to 
        exclude 70% of dividends received from their taxable income. Quantum 
        Online also specifies whether each preferred qualifies for the corporate 
        dividend received deduction.
        

How
        To

		Evaluate 

		Preferred 
        
        Stocks

        Evaluate preferreds by analyzing the issuing companys financial 
        strength. Whats important is that the firm has the cash to pay its 
        dividends. It doesnt matter if the issuers earnings came in below 
        analysts estimates or it said next quarter sales would be lower than 
        previously forecast. 
Here 
        are some selection criteria to keep in mind.
  
		Current Price vs. Call Price: ideally, the current preferred trading 
		price would be below the call price, and should never be more than 15% 
		above the call price. 
  
        Credit Rating: conservative investors should stick with investment grade (any rating starting with "A" 
        and three-letter "B" ratings).
  
        Trading Volume: minimum 4,000 shares, traded daily, on average.
  
		Issuers common stock trading price: minimum $5 and higher is better. 


Preferred 
Stock 
Glossary

Adjustable Rate: annual dividend varies depending on predefined 
        factors. 

Baby Bonds: same as Senior Notes (see below). 

Callable: issuer has the right to redeem shares at issue price 
        after a specified date. 

Call Date: earliest date that shares can be called. Usually five 
        years after issue date. 

Call Price: price issuer will pay for redeemed shares. Usually 
        the same as the issue price. 

Convertible: holders have the right to convert preferred shares 
        to common stock at predetermined ratio after specified date. This gives 
        preferred holders a chance to benefit from the common stocks share 
        price appreciation. 

Coupon Rate: yield based on initial issue price 

Cumulative: skipped dividends must still be paid before common 
        stock dividends are paid and before the shares are redeemed. 

Current Yield: yield based on current share price.

CUSIP: unique identifier for each security. 

Exchange-Traded Debt Securities: a.k.a. Preferred Equity Traded 
        (PET) Bonds or Junior Subordinated Debentures. Debt securities such as 
        debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These unsecured debt 
        instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to preferred and common 
        stocks. 

Ex-Dividend Date: you must purchase shares prior to the 
        ex-dividend date to receive the corresponding payout. 

Issue Price: original share price. 

Liquidation Value: same as issue price. 

Market Yield: same as current yield. 

Maturity Date: the date the preferred shares must be redeemed by 
        the issuing firm, typically 30 to 100 years after issue. 

Non-Cumulative: depending on the preferred, skipped dividends can 
		be delayed for five-years, or even indefinitely.  Unlike failing to 
		pay required bond interest payments, preferred issuers are not "in 
		default" if they skip preferred dividends. 

        However, skipped 
		dividends must still be paid before common stock dividends are paid and 
		before the shares are redeemed. 

Par Value: same as issue price 

Participating: annual dividend varies depending on firms net 
        income or dividends paid to common shareholders. 

PINES (Public Income Notes): a.k.a. QUIBS (Quarterly Interest 
        Bonds) or QUIDS (Quarterly Income Debt Securities). Debt securities such 
        as debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These senior 
        unsecured debt instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to 
        preferred and common stocks. 

Redeemable: same as callable. 

Redemption Date: same as call date. 

Senior Notes: Issuers cannot skip preferred interest payments 
		(dividends) without going into default. 

Third Party Trust Preferred: a Trust Preferred issued by a third 
        party such as an underwriter. 

Trust Preferred Securities: a cumulative preferred variation that provides certain 
        income tax and accounting advantages over traditional preferreds to the 
        issuer, but not for the shareholder. Instead of selling preferreds 
        directly, a corporation sets up a special trust that buys debt 
        securities from the corporation and, in turn, issues preferred shares. If the issuer suspends dividends, shareholders may still be 
        liable for income taxes on the unpaid dividends. TruPS - Trust Preferred 
        Securities are Smith Barney's brand name for Trust Preferreds. 
        TOPrS - Trust Originated Preferred Securities are Merrill Lynch's 
        brand name for Trust Preferreds. 

Yield to Call: return you would receive assuming the preferred is 
        redeemed on the call date.
Yield to Maturity: return you would receive assuming the 
        preferred is redeemed on its maturity date.

About Griffin Capital Company, LLC

Overview
Griffin Capital Company, LLC ("Griffin Capital") is a leading alternative investment asset manager with approximately $9.5 billion* in assets under management. Founded in 1995, the privately held firm is led by a seasoned team of senior executives with more than two decades of investment and real estate experience and who collectively have executed more than 650 transactions valued at over $22 billion.
The firm manages, sponsors or co-sponsors a suite of carefully curated, institutional quality investment solutions distributed by Griffin Capital Securities, LLC to retail investors through a community of partners, including independent and insurance broker-dealers, wirehouses, registered investment advisory firms and the financial advisors who work with these enterprises.
*As of June 30, 2017.

Open Offerings
Griffin Institutional Access™ Credit Fund (The “Credit Fund” NASDAQ: CRDTX, CGCCX, CRDIX) is a publicly registered, closed-end interval fund that offers individual investors access to an actively managed, globally diversified** portfolio of credit instruments sub-advised by Bain Capital Credit, LP. The Credit Fund provides daily pricing and a degree of quarterly liquidity at net asset value (NAV), which enhances transparency and provides investors with increased flexibility.
Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund (The “Real Estate Fund” NASDAQ: GIREX, GCREX, GLREX, GRIFX) is a publicly registered, closed-end interval fund that offers individual investors access to an actively managed portfolio of private real estate funds and public real estate securities selected by some of the largest and most respected institutional investment managers. The Real Estate Fund provides daily pricing and a degree of quarterly liquidity at net asset value (NAV), which enhances transparency and provides investors with increased flexibility.
Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. is a publicly registered, non-traded real estate investment trust that invests in medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. Up to $3 billion in shares of common stock are being offered in Class T and Class I Shares.






Closed Offerings
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, Inc. is an SEC registered, non-traded real estate investment trust focused on providing individual investors dependable monthly income through the ownership of a diversified portfolio of 'business essential' office and industrial properties net leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy corporate tenants.
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc. ("GCEARII") is a publicly registered, non-traded real estate investment trust focused on providing investors monthly income(2) through the ownership of a diversified portfolio of 'business essential' office and industrial properties net leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy corporate tenants. GCEARII seeks to raise up to $2 billion of equity in its current offering.
Griffin-Benefit Street Partners BDC ("GB-BDC”) is a non-traded business development company sponsored and co-sponsored respectively by Griffin Capital and Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. ("Benefit Street"), the credit investment arm of Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., a leading global, private equity firm with over $40 billion in assets under advisement. We believe GB-BDC is distinguished from other non-traded BDCs due to the company’s intent to leverage the expertise and experience of Providence Equity and Benefit Street in the media and communications industries, which accounted for nearly one third of recent M&A activity – a key source of middle-market lending opportunities, as well as Benefit Street’s strong investment track record and proprietary sourcing network, and their emphasis on direct originated, non-sponsored, secured debt.
Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc. is a publicly registered, non-traded real estate investment trust. Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III is seeking to build a diverse portfolio of healthcare-related assets.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Griffin Institutional Access™ Credit Fund, Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund and Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. This and other important information about these investments is contained in each investment's prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting Griffin Capital Securities at 949-270-9300 or by clicking on the product-specific sections of this website. The applicable prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, Member FINRA/SIPC, is the dealer manager for the Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. offering.
Griffin Capital Securities, LLC is the exclusive wholesale marketing agent for the Griffin Institutional Access™ Credit Fund and the Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund. ALPS Distributors, Inc. is the distributor of the Griffin Institutional Access™ Credit Fund and the Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund. Griffin Capital and ALPS Distributors, Inc., 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100 Denver, CO 80203, are not affiliated with each other.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’

© 2017 Griffin Capital Company, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’

		Risk Factors


Understanding the Risks

An investment in Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III involves a high degree of risk. Investors should purchase shares of our common stock only if they can afford a complete loss of their investment. Investors should carefully consider the information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our common stock, including but not limited to, the following:

There is no public market for the shares of our common stock. Shares of our common stock cannot be readily sold and there are significant restrictions on the ownership, transferability and repurchase of shares of our common stock. If you are able to sell your shares of our common stock, you likely would have to sell them at a substantial discount.
We have no operating history or established financing sources. Therefore, you may not be able to adequately evaluate our ability to achieve our investment objectives.
Until we generate operating cash flows sufficient to pay distributions to you, we may pay distributions from the net proceeds of this offering or borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows. We may also be required to sell assets or issue new securities for cash in order to pay distributions. We have not established any limit on the amount of offering proceeds or borrowings that may be used to fund distributions other than those limits imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland law, and it is likely that we will use offering proceeds to fund a majority of our initial distributions. Any such actions could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and negatively impact the amount of income available for future distributions.
We may incur substantial debt, which could hinder our ability to pay distributions to you or could decrease the value of your investment if the income from, or the value of, the property securing our debt falls.
We will rely on our advisor and its affiliates for our day-to-day operations and the selection of our investments. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor and its affiliates for these services, including compensation that may be required to be paid to our advisor even if our advisor is terminated as a result of poor performance, and the agreements governing these fees were not all negotiated at arm’s-length. In addition, fees payable to our dealer manager and our advisor in our organizational stage are based upon the gross offering proceeds and not on our properties’ performance. Such agreements may require us to pay more than we would if we were only using unaffiliated third parties and may not solely reflect your interests as a stockholder of our company.
Many of our officers also are principals, officers and/or employees of our co-sponsors and other affiliated entities. As a result, our officers will face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts in allocating time and investment opportunities among us and similar programs sponsored by one of our co-sponsors or its affiliates.
If we do not qualify as a REIT or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates, which would adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay distributions to you.
The amount of distributions we may pay, if any, is uncertain. Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate and real estate-related investments, there is no guarantee of any return on your investment in us and you may lose money.
We are not obligated, through our charter or otherwise, to effectuate a liquidity event, and we may not effect a liquidity event within our targeted time frame of five years after the completion of our offering stage, or at all. If we do not effect a liquidity event, you may have to hold your investment in shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time.
We face competition for the acquisition of medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities, which may impede our ability to make acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions and may reduce our profitability and could cause you to experience a lower return on your investment.
Our results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and our ability to dispose of our investments are subject to international, national and local economic factors we cannot control or predict.
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.
Adverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively affect our lease revenues and our ability to pay distributions to you.
The healthcare industry is currently experiencing:

Changes in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services;
Changes in third party reimbursement policies;
Significant unused capacity in certain areas, which has created substantial competition for patients among healthcare providers in those areas;
Increased expense for uninsured patients;
Increased liability insurance expense;
Continued pressure by the private and governmental payors to reduce payments to providers of service;
Increased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by federal and state authorities;
Changes in federal and state healthcare program payment models; and
Increased emphasis on compliance with privacy and security requirements related to personal health information.

These factors may adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our tenants and, in turn, our lease revenues and our ability to pay distributions to you.

Reductions in reimbursement from third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us.

Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’

Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II, Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. are merging








You may have recently received communication from Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II, Inc. (Griffin) that they are merging with NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NorthStar) to enhance value and offer investor liquidity. This information, while helpful, may prompt further questions for you about your IRA holding.
 
This merger has caused significant changes in the structure and relationship between First Trust Retirement (FTR) and NorthStar. FTR keeps its costs low by utilizing the product sponsor’s existing transfer agency structure. This allows us to embed our services into the media, mailings, and reporting that is already in place for the product sponsors. This merger has transitioned Griffin off of that structure. Due to this transition, the FTR IRA account holders impacted by this merger will receive notification and explanation from FTR on the new structure and services on their account.					    
 
Starting on December 2, 2014, please use the mailing and contact instructions listed below for all requests on NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. FTR IRA account(s).

© 2017 Griffin Capital Company, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

(1) We intend to invest in properties leased to blue chip tenants and/or companies with investment grade credit ratings. There is no guarantee all of our properties will be leased to blue chip tenants or companies with investment grade credit ratings. Blue chip companies are well-known and respected publicly traded companies that typically make up the Dow Jones group of companies. Blue chip and investment grade descriptions are those of either tenants and/or guarantors with investment grade credit ratings or whose non-guarantor parent companies have investment grade credit ratings.

By “Invest Like an Institution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund enables individuals to invest in an investment structure (a combination of private real estate funds and public real estate securities) frequently chosen by institutions, large and small, as their preferred structure for real estate investments. We also mean the Fund is managed by sub-advisors who only advise institutions. Finally, we mean that investors in this Fund invest alongside numerous institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies; literally, a portion of their dollars are invested in the same private equity real estate funds as those owned by institutions.
By “Your Public and Private Real Estate Investment Solution,” we mean that Griffin Institutional Access™ Real Estate Fund, which offers investors a blend of public and private real estate investments selected and managed by leading institutions (the Fund’s sub-advisors) delivers an investment solution. This Fund, because it provides an array of potential benefits from current income to less volatility and modest market correlation to pricing transparency and periodic liquidity, is a ’solution.’
