Liquid Alternative ETFs: WisdomTree DYLS and DYB






























































                            WisdomTree now has the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S.
                            Equity Fund (DYLS) and the WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund (DYB) enabling
                            investors to access the advantages of alternative investment strategies with all
                            the benefits of exchange-traded funds.
                            


WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Fund

DYLS is a primarily long1
                                    strategy that is designed to add short2 exposure to hedge risk and reduce
                                    the net long exposure. The Fund can be 100%, 50%, or 0% net long, depending on market
                                    conditions. 
                                


WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund


                                    DYB is able to be net short or market neutral when the market environment 
                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing.

Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Products & Services


ABS manages a family of equity long/short multi-manager funds as well as a variety of customized accounts designed to address the wide range of objectives and constraints of our institutional investors. From broadly diversified portfolios targeting global equity market returns to specialized niche mandates such as emerging markets, we partner with our clients to apply our knowledge, experience and comprehensive investment process in an effort to assist them in achieving their goals.
Our commingled products, which include vehicles for both ERISA and non-ERISA clients, include:

Global equity strategies with a moderate long-bias
Global equity strategies with a significant long-bias
Emerging market equity strategies with a significant long-bias

Our Customized Accounts include the following mandates:

Global equity strategies with low net market exposure
Global equity strategies with a moderate long-bias
Emerging market equity strategies with a moderate long-bias
Americas equity strategies with a moderate long-bias

Rationale for Equity Long/Short
ABS believes that equity long/short strategies compare favorably relative to both traditional ("long-only") equity strategies and other hedge fund strategies. Relative to traditional equity strategies, we believe equity long/short offers comparable long-term returns with lower volatility due to the ability to allocate risk capital in a more flexible format. Relative to other hedge fund strategies, we believe equity long/short offers greater transparency, independent pricing and limited leverage. Additionally, in our view the diversity within the universe of equity long/short strategies allows ABS to deliver a broad array of risk/return profiles in an effort to meet the varying needs of our clients.
The ABSolute

Our proprietary system, the ABSolute, is an evolving reflection of our needs and the needs of our clients. While we design and manage the development process in-house, we have a dedicated external team of programmers who have invested nearly eighty thousand hours of development time to date.
As the nexus of all key firm activities, the ABSolute monitors current investments, tracks potential managers, quantifies and stores qualitative and quantitative research, and measures and maintains investment limitations, investment guidelines and investment allocations. Additionally, the ABSolute aggregates investment exposures by region, sector, and market cap at the underlying manager and portfolio level, and provides our clients with direct access to data through our secure website.

Process :: ABS Investment Management





















ABS Investment Management
				







Our Process


Characteristics of Our Investment Process

People Business - Our investment process is grounded in the belief that genuine investment talent is scarce, and high quality, high integrity people are the key drivers to long-term success.
Comprehensiveness - Potential investments are rigorously scrutinized by three independent in-house teams consisting of the qualitative, quantitative, and operational due diligence teams, all of whom have the power to veto a potential investment.
Risk Management - Ongoing risk management frames all portfolio decisions and allows for a dynamic understanding of the risk taken both at the underlying manager level and at the portfolio level.
The ABSolute - Our proprietary system serves as the nexus of all key firm activity, from our comprehensive due diligence and ongoing risk management, to our highly customizable client reporting and transparency that we offer via our website and our client service team.

ABS employs a three stage investment process comprising qualitative (bottom-up) due diligence, quantitative analysis and operational due diligence. Each independent due diligence team has the power to veto further work on a potential manager, and a manager is only eligible for investment after being approved by each team.
Three Stage Process






1. Qualitative Due Diligence
The objective of the qualitative due diligence team is to source what we believe to be the most talented managers within the equity long/short space. Our process seeks to identify the manager's motivation and competitive edge, and to determine whether there is an alignment of interest. We assign significant value to our determination of each key individual's character, which we seek to confirm through numerous reference checks relying on our extensive network. Additionally, we must have a thorough understanding of the manager's strategy, and feel comfortable with the strategy's return drivers. We will not invest in a strategy that we don't understand fully.


2. Quantitative Due Diligence
The objective of the quantitative due diligence team's analysis is to confirm the research completed by the qualitative team, particularly as it relates to the potential manager's strategy and return drivers. The quantitative team will use data including exposures, attribution and monthly or daily returns to determine where the manager takes risk and how the manager has historically been compensated for those risks (factors, beta, flexible beta and alpha). If the qualitative and quantitative teams are unable to reconcile their perceptions of the manager's strategy, then the investment will not be pursued.


3. Operational Due Diligence
The objective of the operational due diligence team is to confirm that a manager's back office operations strive for industry best practices prior to and during our investment. In the event that aspects of the operational set up are lacking, our team will veto the investment or work with the manager's back office staff to implement all necessary improvements. In short, operational risk should be minimized leaving only those investment risks that we are comfortable with and expect to be compensated for.

ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

�



�
To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders 
 ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

�
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities, and shareholders� capital, including the schedule of investments of ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund (the Fund) as of April 30, 2016, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders� capital, cash flows, and financial highlights for the period from January 4, 2016 (commencement of operations) to April 30, 2016. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund�s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. 
�
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free from material misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund�s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of April
30, 2016, by correspondence with the investee funds� investment advisor or administrator. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
�
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund as of April 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows, the changes in shareholders� capital and financial highlights for the period from January 4, 2016 (commencement of operations) to April 30, 2016 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
April 30, 2016



�
1. Organization

�
ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund (the �Fund�) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on June 24, 2015 and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and operates as a �tender offer fund.� The Fund�s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation over a full market cycle while maintaining a lower level of volatility when compared to the global equity markets. 
�
The Fund commenced operations on January 4, 2016. The Fund had no operations prior to January 4, 2016 other than those relating to its organization and the sale of 1,000 shares of beneficial interest in the Fund at $100.0000 per share to ABS Investment Management LLC (the �Adviser�) on September 29, 2015. Simultaneous with the commencement of the Fund�s operations (�Commencement of Operations�) on January 4, 2016, ABS (3)(C)(1) LP (the �Predecessor Fund�), was reorganized with and into the Fund. This exchange was nontaxable, whereby the Fund issued 447,524 shares for the net assets of the Predecessor Fund on January 4, 2016. Total assets with a fair market value of $44,752,356 including securities
of the Predecessor Fund with a fair value of $40,243,919 (identified cost of investments transferred $33,647,656) were the primary assets received by the Fund. For financial reporting purposes, assets received and shares issued by the Fund were recorded at fair value; however, the cost basis of the investments received from the Predecessor Fund was carried forward to align ongoing reporting of the Fund�s realized and unrealized gains and losses with amount distributable to shareholders for tax purposes. 
�
At April 30, 2016, the Fund offered a single class of shares known as Founders� Shares (�Founders� Shares�). See Note 12 regarding the Fund offering multiple classes of shares. 
�
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

�
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (�U.S. GAAP�). The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement, as well as reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
�
The Fund is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946 �Financial Services�Investment Companies.� 
�
a. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Board of Trustees (�Board�) has established a Valuation Committee to oversee the valuation of the Fund�s investments on behalf of the Fund. The Board has approved valuation procedures for the Fund (the �Valuation Procedures�). The Valuation Procedures provide that the Fund will value its investments in direct investments and Portfolio Funds at fair value. 
�
The valuations of investments in Portfolio Funds are generally supported by monthly valuation statements received from the Portfolio Funds� independent administrators. In addition, investor reports and audited financial statements, among other things, maybe considered when available or necessary. 
�
In accordance with the Valuation Procedures, fair value as of each month-end or other applicable accounting periods, as applicable, ordinarily will be the value determined as of such date by each Portfolio Fund in accordance with the Portfolio Fund�s valuation policies and reported at the time of the Fund�s valuation. As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund�s interest in a Portfolio Fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from the Portfolio Fund if the Fund�s interest was redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the event that a Portfolio Fund or its independent administrator does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis, the Fund will determine the fair value of such Portfolio Fund based on the most recent estimated value reported by the Portfolio Fund, as well as any other
relevant information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. 
�
The Fund classifies its assets and liabilities into three levels based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used if a ready market existed or if the investments were liquidated at the valuation date.

April 30, 2016



�
The three-tier hierarchy distinguishes between (1) inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (2) inputs that reflect the reporting entity�s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs) and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Fund�s investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: 
�



�

Level 1


Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. The types of investments in Level 1 generally include listed equities and listed derivatives.





�



�

Level 2


Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and fair value that is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments in this category generally include corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. A significant adjustment to a Level 2 input could result in the Level 2 measurement becoming a Level 3 measurement.





�



�

Level 3


Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments in this category generally include equity and debt positions in private companies.





�
Investments in Portfolio Funds are recorded at fair value, using the Portfolio Fund�s net asset value as a practical expedient. 
�
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (�ASU�) No. 2015-07 Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). ASU No. 2015-07 amends the fair value accounting rules to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The Fund has adopted this update and as a result of adopting it, investments in Portfolio Funds with a fair value of $53,080,049 are excluded from the fair value hierarchy as of April 30, 2016.

�
b. Investment Income

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.

�
c. Fund Expenses

The Fund will pay all of its expenses, or reimburse the Adviser or their affiliates to the extent they have previously paid such expenses on behalf of the Fund. The expenses of the Fund include, but are not limited to, any fees and expenses in connection with the offering and issuance of shares of beneficial interest (�Shares�) of the Fund; all fees and expenses directly related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Fund�s account; all fees and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the operation of the Fund, such as investment management fee, legal fees, auditing fees, accounting, administration, and tax preparation fees, custodial fees, costs of insurance, registration expenses and trustees� fees. 
�
Organizational costs consist of the costs of forming the Fund, drafting of bylaws, administration, custody and transfer agency agreements, legal services in connection with the initial meeting of trustees and the Fund�s seed audit costs. Offering costs consist of the costs of preparation, review and filing with the SEC the Fund�s registration statement (including the Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information), the costs of preparation, review and filing of any associated marketing or similar materials, the costs associated with the printing, mailing or other distribution of the Prospectus, SAI and/or marketing materials, and the amounts of associated filing fees and legal fees associated with the offering. The aggregate amount of the organizational costs and offering costs as of April 30, 2016 are $49,073
and $166,006, respectively. Organizational costs and offering costs are subject to the Fund�s expense limitation agreement discussed in Note 3 and offering costs are being amortized over twelve months on a straight-line basis. 
�
d. Income Tax Information & Distributions to Shareholders 
The Fund�s policy is to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that are applicable to regulated investment companies (�RICs�) and to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and any net realized gains to its shareholders (�Shareholders�). Therefore, no provision is made for federal income or excise taxes. Due to the 
�

�



ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
April 30, 2016



�
timing of dividend distributions and the differences in accounting for income and realized gains and losses for financial statement and federal income tax purposes, the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may differ from the year in which the income and realized gains and losses are recorded by the Fund.

�
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (the �Income Tax Statement�) requires an evaluation of tax positions taken (or expected to be taken) in the course of preparing Fund�s tax returns to determine whether these positions meet a �more-likely-than-not� standard that, based on the technical merits, have a more than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained by a taxing authority upon examination. A tax position that meets the �more-likely-than-not� recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. 
�
The Income Tax Statement requires management of the Fund to analyze tax positions expected to be taken in the Fund�s tax returns, as defined by Internal Revenue Service (the �IRS�) statute of limitations for all major jurisdictions, including federal tax authorities and certain state tax authorities. During the period January 4, 2016 (commencement of operations) through April 30, 2016, the Fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits. The Fund has no examination in progress and is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. 
�
The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income or net realized gain may differ from the characterization for federal income tax purposes due to differences in the recognition of income, expense and gain/(loss) items for financial statement and tax purposes. Where appropriate, reclassifications between net asset accounts are made for such differences that are permanent in nature.

�
As of April 30, 2016, the federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) were as follows:

�



Gross unrealized appreciation


�

$


4,466,649

There are no differences between cost and unrealized amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes because the Fund will not complete its first tax year end until September 30, 2016.

�
e. Cash

Cash includes interest bearing non-restricted cash with one financial institution.

�
3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

�
The Fund is managed by the Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Certain officers of the Fund are also directors and officers of the Adviser.

�
The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement (the �Advisory Agreement�) with the Adviser. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for developing, implementing and supervising the Fund�s continuous investment program in a manner reasonably consistent with the investment objective and policies of the Fund. As compensation for services and facilities required to be provided by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement, the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee at an annual rate equal to 1.00%, payable monthly based on the Fund�s month end net asset value. 
�
Under the terms of the expense limitation agreement, the Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to limit the Fund�s total annual fund operating expenses attributable to the Founders� Shares to 1.10% (after the fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, and exclusive of taxes, interest, portfolio transaction expenses (including but not limited to brokerage fees and commissions, custodial �ticket� costs to process Fund investments in other investment funds, and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, holding, and disposition of securities and other investments), acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend expenses on short sales and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund�s business). Expenses reimbursed and/or fees reduced by the Adviser may be recouped by the Adviser for a period of three (3) fiscal years following the end of the fiscal year during
which such reimbursement or reduction was made if such recoupment does not cause current expenses to exceed the expense limit for Founders� Shares in effect at the time the expenses were paid/waived. These 
�

ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

�
arrangements will continue until August 30, 2019 and may be terminated or extended by the Board at any time. No such termination shall affect the obligation (including the amount of the obligation) of the Fund to repay amounts of waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses with respect to periods prior to such termination.

�
For the period January 4, 2016 (commencement of operations) through April 30, 2016, the Adviser waived management fees totaling $174,227 and reimbursed other expenses of $34,985. The Adviser may recover from the Fund fees and/or expenses previously waived and/or reimbursed if the Fund�s expense ratio, including the recovered expenses, falls below the expense limit at which they were waived. The Adviser is permitted to seek reimbursement from the Fund for a period ending three full fiscal years following the fiscal year in which such reimbursements occurred. At April 30, 2016, the amount of these potentially recoverable expenses was $209,212. The Adviser may recapture all or a portion of this amount no later than April 30, 2019. 
�
Foreside Fund Services, LLC acts as the Fund�s principal underwriter. 
�
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

�
At April 30, 2016, Shareholders who are affiliated with the Adviser owned approximately 5% of Shareholders� Capital of the Fund. 
�
On January 4, 2016, the Predecessor Fund, a private investment fund, was reorganized with and into the Fund. The Predecessor Fund maintained an investment objective and investment policies that were, in all material respects, equivalent to those of the Fund. The Fund and the Predecessor Fund shared the same investment adviser and portfolio managers. At April 30, 2016, a receivable of cash, net of outstanding liabilities owed by the Predecessor Fund to the Fund, is disclosed in the Fund�s Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders� Capital. The Predecessor Fund completed the payment of this receivable to the Fund in June 2016. Further details regarding the reorganization and the transfer of the Predecessor Fund�s securities are discussed in Note 1. 
�
5. ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY AGREEMENT

�
UMB Fund Services, Inc., serves as administrator (the �Administrator�) to the Fund and provides certain accounting, administrative, record keeping and investor related services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the Administrator based upon Shareholders� Capital, subject to certain minimums. 
�
UMB Bank, N.A. (the �Custodian�), an affiliate of the Administrator, serves as the primary custodian of the assets of the Fund, and may maintain custody of such assets with U.S. and non-U.S. sub-custodians, securities depositories and clearing agencies. 
�
6. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS

�
Shares are generally offered for purchase as of the first day of each calendar month at the Fund�s then-current Shareholders� Capital per Share (determined as of the close of the preceding month), except that Shares may be offered more or less frequently as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Transactions in Shares were as follows:

�
7. REPURCHASES OF SHARES

�
Shareholders do not have the right to require the Fund to redeem any or all of their Shares. To provide a limited degree of liquidity to Shareholders, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares pursuant to written repurchase offers, but is not obligated to do so. Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase Shares, the Board will consider a variety of operational, business and economic factors. The Board convenes quarterly to consider whether or not to authorize a repurchase offer. The Board

�
13
�



ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

�
expects that repurchase offers, if authorized, will be made no more frequently than on a quarterly basis and will typically have a valuation date as of March 31, June 30, September 30 or December 31 (or, if any such date is not a Business Day, on the last Business Day of such calendar quarter).

�
8. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

�
For the period January 4, 2016 (commencement of operations) through April 30, 2016, the purchase and sale of investments, excluding short-term investments, were $17,250,000 and $0, respectively.

�
9. COMMITMENTS

�
As of April 30, 2016, the Fund had outstanding investment commitments to Portfolio Funds totaling $1,600,000.

�
10. INDEMNIFICATION

�
In the normal course of business, the Fund has entered into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund�s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
�
11. RISK FACTORS

�
The Fund is subject to substantial risks, including market risks, strategy risks and Portfolio Fund manager risks. Portfolio Funds generally will not be registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act and, therefore, the Fund will not be entitled to the various protections afforded by the Investment Company Act with respect to its investments in Portfolio Funds. While the Adviser will attempt to moderate any risks of securities activities of the Portfolio Fund managers, there can be no assurance that the Fund�s investment activities will be successful or that the Shareholders will not suffer losses. The Adviser will not have any control over the Portfolio Fund managers, thus there can be no assurances that a Portfolio Fund manager will manage its portfolio in a manner consistent with the Fund�s investment objective. 
�
12. EXEMPTIVE RELIEF AND MULTIPLE SHARE CLASS REGISTRATION

�
On December 10, 2015, the Fund submitted an exemptive application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�) to permit the Fund to offer multiple classes of shares (the �Exemptive Application�). The SEC granted the Fund an exemptive order on June 8, 2016. 
�
The Board approved the filing of a related amended registration statement on April 5, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on June 6, 2016, to allow the Fund to offer multiple share classes.

�
As of the date the financial statements were issued, no additional share classes had commenced operations.

�
13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

�
Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events to report.

Information on the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330. 
�
Approval of Investment Management Agreement

�
This section describes some factors considered by the Board of Trustees (the �Trustees� or �Board�) of the ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund (the �Fund�) in the Board�s consideration and approval of the key agreements under which the Fund is managed. The Board is responsible for the oversight of the Fund. As a registered investment company, the Fund is subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�) and the rules under the 1940 Act that have been adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the 1940 Act, the Board, including a majority of the Trustees who are not parties to the Fund�s contract for investment advisory services and who are independent from management under a statutory standard set forth in that Act (the �Independent Trustees�), must, to allow an investment adviser to manage
the Fund, approve the Fund�s agreement for investment advisory services for an initial term of not greater than two years, and thereafter must annually review and approve the agreement. For the Fund, this agreement is called the Investment Management Agreement (the �Management Agreement�), and it appoints ABS Investment Management LLC (the �Adviser�) to serve as investment adviser. 
�
At a meeting held on September 28, 2015 (the �Meeting�), the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, met in person, joined by, among others, representatives of the Adviser and counsel to the Fund (�Fund Counsel�), to give consideration to information provided by the Adviser in seeking approval from the Board of the �Management Agreement�. A description of certain of the factors the Board considered and its conclusions in approving the Advisory Agreement follows. 
�
The Board discussed the proposed Management Agreement. The Board considered, among other things: (1) the nature, extent and quality of the investment management services expected to be rendered; (2) the experience and qualifications of the personnel that will be providing such services; (3) the proposed fee structure and the expense ratios in relation to those of other investment companies having comparable investment policies and limitations; (4) the direct and indirect costs that may be incurred by the Adviser in performing advisory services for the Fund, the basis of determining and allocating these costs, and the estimated profitability to the Adviser in performing such services; (5) possible economies of scale arising from any anticipated growth of the Fund and the extent to which these would be passed on to shareholders of the Fund; (6) other compensation or possible benefits to the Adviser and any affiliates arising from their advisory and other relationships
with the Fund; (7) the fees charged by the Adviser and other investment managers to similar clients and in comparison to industry fees for similar services; (8) the historic performance of the product that was the predecessor to the Fund; (9) possible conflicts of interest that the Adviser may have with respect to the Fund; and (10) the entrepreneurial risk borne by the Adviser (e.g., because a Fund is in a start-up mode or for other reasons, the Adviser�s revenues may be less or their expenses greater than anticipated). The Board reviewed information provided by ABS in the Board Materials, which included, among other things, information regarding: (1) the Adviser�s organizational structure, management, personnel and proposed services to the Fund; (2) the fees to be paid by the Fund to the Adviser for services rendered under the investment advisory agreement; (3) the financial stability of the Adviser; and (4) the Adviser�s compliance program, including the Adviser�s
Code of Ethics. 
�
The Board considered the services to be rendered by the Adviser to the Fund as set forth in the Management Agreement, including without limitation: the provision of a complete investment management program for the Fund and related Board reporting, the voting of proxies relating to portfolio investments, and the fair valuation of the Fund�s portfolio investments, which will consist principally of interests in private investment companies, subject to oversight of the Trust�s Valuation Committee. The Board also considered the due diligence process utilized by the Adviser to identify and evaluate managers of the potential private investment companies in which the Fund will invest and the Adviser�s compliance policies and procedures including those dedicated to assuring that investments made are consistent with the Fund�s investment objectives and limitations. The Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the 
�
16
�



ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund

OTHER INFORMATION (Unaudited) - Continued
April 30, 2016



�
services provided by the Adviser to the Fund are appropriate and consistent with the terms of the Fund�s Management Agreement, that the quality of those services are anticipated to be consistent with industry norms and that the Fund is likely to benefit from the Adviser�s management of the Fund�s investment program. 
�
The Board considered that while the Fund had not commenced operations and thus did not have investment performance information to review, they could consider the historic performance of the product that was the predecessor to the Fund and the performance of the Adviser�s other clients and concluded that the performance was in line with its primary benchmark and thus they concluded that they were satisfied with the Adviser�s performance. 
�
The Board also concluded that the Adviser had sufficient personnel, with the appropriate education and experience, to serve the Fund effectively and have demonstrated their continuing ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.

�
The Board considered the anticipated costs of the services provided by the Adviser, and the compensation and benefits received by the Adviser in providing services to the Fund. The Board compared the expected fees and expenses of the Fund (including the management fee) to certain other closed-end tender offer fund of funds. The Board noted that with respect to the proposed management fee to be paid to the Adviser, only one peer fund had a lower management fee and the projected net expense ratio of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees) is lower than all of the other funds in the peer group. The Board concluded that the Adviser�s anticipated fees and profits to be derived from its relationship with the Fund in light of the Fund�s expenses, were reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided, taking into account the fees charged by other investment advisers for managing comparable funds. The Board also concluded that the overall
expense ratio of the Fund was reasonable, taking into account the projected size of the Fund and the quality of services to be provided by the Adviser. 
�
The Board considered the extent to which economies of scale could be realized, and whether fee levels would reflect those economies, noting that because the Fund was small and had yet to commence operations, there were currently no economies of scale.

�
Based on consideration of all factors deemed relevant, the Board determined that approval of the Management Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund. The Board considered all factors and no one factor alone was deemed dispositive.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures


I. INTRODUCTION


ABS Long/Short Strategies Fund (the �Fund�) is the beneficial owner of its portfolio securities. Accordingly, the Fund�s Board of Trustees (the �Board�), acting on behalf of the Fund, has the right and the fiduciary obligation to vote proxies relating to the Fund�s portfolio securities in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board has adopted these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures with respect to voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund (these �Policies and Procedures�).


II. POLICY


A. DELEGATION TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER.


1. The policy of the Fund is to delegate the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund�s investment adviser (the �Adviser�) as a part of the Adviser�s general management of the Fund, subject to the Board�s continuing oversight.


2. The policy of the Fund is also to adopt the policies and procedures used by the Adviser to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by its clients, including the Fund (the �Adviser�s Policies and Procedures�).


3. The Adviser shall periodically inform its employees (i) that they are under an obligation to be aware of the potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser with respect to voting proxies on behalf of the Fund, both as a result of the employee�s personal relationships and due to circumstances that may arise during the conduct of the Adviser�s business, and (ii) that employees should bring conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of the management of the Adviser.







4. The Adviser shall be responsible for coordinating the delivery of proxies by the Fund�s custodian to the Adviser or to an agent of the Adviser selected by the Adviser to vote proxies with respect to which the Adviser has such discretion.


III. FIDUCIARY DUTY


The Adviser is a fiduciary to the Fund and must vote proxies in a manner consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.


IV. PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES


A. ANNUAL PRESENTATION OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES TO THE BOARD. At least annually, the Adviser shall present to the Board for its review the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures. In addition, the Adviser shall notify the Board promptly of material changes to the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures.


B. ANNUAL PRESENTATION OF PROXY VOTING RECORD TO THE BOARD. At least annually, the Adviser shall provide to the Board a record of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio securities held by the Fund during the year. With respect to those proxies that the Adviser has identified as involving a conflict of interest, the Adviser shall submit a separate report indicating the nature of the conflict of interest and how that conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy. For this purpose, a �conflict of interest� shall be deemed to occur when the Adviser, the Fund�s principal underwriters, or an affiliated person of the Adviser or a principal underwriter has a financial interest in a matter presented by a proxy to be voted on behalf of the Fund, other than the obligation the Adviser incurs as investment adviser to the Fund, which may compromise the Adviser�s independence of judgment and action in voting the proxy.


C. RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Where a proxy proposal raises a material conflict of interest between the interests of the Adviser, the Fund�s principal underwriter, or an affiliated person of the Fund, the Adviser or a principal underwriter and that of the Fund, the Adviser shall resolve such conflict in the manner described below.


1. Vote in Accordance with a Predetermined Specific Policy. To the extent that the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures include a pre-determined voting policy for various types of proposals and the Adviser has little or no discretion to deviate from such policy with respect to the proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such pre-determined voting policy.


2. Notify and Obtain Consent of the Board. To the extent that the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures include a pre-determined voting policy for various proposals and the Adviser has discretion to deviate from such policy, or the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures do not include pre-determined policies, the Adviser shall disclose the conflict to the Board and obtain the Board�s consent to the proposed vote prior to voting on such proposal.







a. Detailed Disclosure to the Board. To enable the Board to make an informed decision regarding the vote in question, such disclosure to the Board shall include sufficient detail regarding the matter to be voted on and the nature of the conflict. When the Board does not respond to such a conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser shall abstain from voting the securities held by the Fund.


b. Use of Independent Third Party. To the extent there is a conflict of interest between the Adviser, the Fund�s principal underwriters, or an affiliated person of the Adviser or a principal underwriter and the Fund and the Adviser notifies the Board of such conflict, the Board may vote the proxy in accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party.


V. REVOCATION OF AUTHORITY TO VOTE


The delegation by the Board of the authority to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund may be revoked by the Board, in whole or in part, at any time.


VI. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD


The Fund shall file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio securities held by the Fund during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX not later than August 31 of each year.


VII. PROXY VOTING DISCLOSURES


A. The Fund shall include in its registration statement:


1. A description of these Policies and Procedures and of the Adviser�s Policies and Procedures; and


2. A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund during the most recent twelve-month period ended June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund�s toll-free telephone number or through a specified Internet address or both and on the SEC website.

Conflicts of Interest
�
As a general matter, certain actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a Portfolio Manager�s management of the Fund�s investments, on the one hand, and the investments of other accounts for which the team member is responsible, on the other. For example, the management of multiple accounts may result in a team member devoting unequal time and attention to the management of each account. Although the Adviser does not track the time a team member spends on a single portfolio, it does periodically assess whether a team member has adequate time and resources to effectively manage all of the accounts for which he is responsible. Moreover, variances in advisory fees charged from account to account may create an incentive for a team member to devote more attention to those accounts that pay higher advisory fees. It is also possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that, at times, might conflict
with one another. Alternatively, to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account, possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them.
�
The Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including trade allocation policies and procedures, which it believes address the conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients.


(a)(3) Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager
�
The Portfolio Managers are Managing Members and equity owners of the Adviser. Their compensation consists of a fixed salary, bonus compensation and their respective share of the Adviser�s earnings. Each year, a bonus pool is established based on the net income of the Adviser and calculated pursuant to pre-set formula. The bonus pool is then allocated to Adviser personnel by the Managing Members. Participation in the bonus pool is at the discretion of the Managing Members and is based on subjective factors determined by the Managing Members in their sole discretion.
�
(a)(4) Disclosure of Securities Ownership

                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing.

Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
