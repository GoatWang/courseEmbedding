                Move follows rule changes aimed at reducing conflicts, costs
            



                New REIT to invest in properties with stable rental income
            



Blackstone Group LP is seeking to raise $5 billion for its first nontraded real estate investment trust, targeting individual investors in a market that has been plagued by conflicts of interests, high commissions and poor performance.The move by the world’s biggest alternative-asset manager follows regulatory rule changes aimed at increasing transparency in the industry for nontraded REITs, which aren’t listed on exchanges and are primarily marketed by brokers to individual buyers. The rules include requiring such trusts to follow stricter guidelines on estimating the net asset values of their holdings and disclosing costs.Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust will be a perpetual-life fund and will invest in commercial properties that generate stable rental income, including apartments, shopping centers and hotels, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. The new REIT hasn’t bought any assets yet. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Blackstone, declined to comment beyond the filing.








“Historically, the fee load has been pretty significant for retail investors to get into these vehicles,” said Dirk Aulabaugh, a managing director in the advisory and consulting unit of Green Street Advisors LLC, a Newport Beach, California-based real estate research firm. Blackstone’s new fund appears to be “better aligned than what has historically been the case in the nontraded REIT space, and I think investors are going to welcome that, and they’ll be successful in raising capital along those lines.”‘Large-Scale’The nontraded REIT is Blackstone’s latest push into less-risky real estate investments. The company already has an open-end fund for institutions called Blackstone Property Partners. That fund buys so-called core-plus real estate -- properties that might require light renovation or leasing work to increase values. The core-plus strategy, which includes separately managed accounts for institutional clients, has grown to about $12 billion in assets, Blackstone Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman said in April.“The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” Schwarzman said on the company’s first-quarter earnings conference call, on April 21. “As we move into the retail chain of distribution with this, we should be able to create a really very large-scale business.”




Higher YieldsNontraded REITs have been able to attract investors partly by offering higher dividend yields than publicly traded property owners. More attention was brought to such products in 2014 with the accounting scandal at American Realty Capital Properties Inc. The landlord was part of the real estate empire of Nicholas Schorsch, whose AR Capital LLC was the largest sponsor of nontraded REITs.“The market’s maturing and it is addressing some of the regulatory concerns over increasing the transparency or decreasing the front-end costs associated with these programs,” said Anthony Chereso, president and CEO of the Investment Program Association trade group. “What you’re going to see is a continuing evolution toward a product that’s going to be more broadly received, and you’ll see capital-raising improve as markets adjust to it.”

Sales of nontraded REITs have plunged. They raised $2.79 billion this year through July, down from $6.41 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Robert A. Stanger & Co. The decline followed a 36 percent drop for all of last year, the real estate investment bank said. Nontraded REITs had $90.9 billion of assets under management as of March 31, according to the Investment Program Association, citing figures from the bank.Returns from nontraded REITs generally lagged behind their publicly traded counterparts, shares of which also are easier to buy and sell, Aulabaugh said. Other nontraded REITs are looking at ways to reduce fees, he said. Blackstone’s track record of delivering strong returns in real estate ought to help it raise money for its new REIT, Aulabaugh said.“They’re going to make the business better,” he said. Blackstone’s entry “will force other players in the space to raise their game.”— With assistance by Devin Banerjee(Trade group corrects assets under management in ninth paragraph of story published Aug. 10.)

Blackstone jumps into nontraded REIT market
Firm wants to raise $5 billion in first venture, possibly through wirehouses






Aug 10, 2016 @ 12:35 pm
By 
	Bruce Kelly























+ Zoom




      Wall Street alternative investment giant The Blackstone Group, with $356 billion in assets, is diving into the beleaguered nontraded real estate investment trust marketplace, registering its first nontraded REIT with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust Inc., which will invest primarily in stabilized income-oriented commercial real estate, looks to raise $5 billion from investors, with $1 billion of that in shares of its distribution reinvestment plan,  according to its registration filing with the SEC. The REIT's special limited partner, an affiliate of Blackstone, will receive a fee of 12.5% of the REIT's total return after meeting a 5% hurdle. Priced at the industry standard $10 per share, the REIT's upfront selling commissions on its T shares are 3%; investors will also pay dealer manager fees of 50 basis points and an annual stockholder servicing fee of 85 basis points, which runs a maximum of seven years, according to the SEC filing.
				



Over the seven-year period, investors who buy $10,000 of the REIT's T shares will pay $906 in commissions and fees, according to the filing. Those who buy S shares will pay slightly higher upfront commissions, but the same total amount over the seven-year period. The REIT's annual dividend, or distribution, will be decided after it begins investing, according to the filing. InvestmentNews reported in February that The Blackstone Group was seriously considering launching a nontraded REIT. But look for Blackstone to shun the traditional marketplace of independent broker-dealers and turn to wirehouses such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, with whom they already have business relationships, to sell the new REIT, according to one industry executive who asked not to be named. Blackstone will likely “distribute this REIT through the wirehouses,” said the executive who said he did not have direct knowledge of the REIT's distribution strategy. “It looks like the REIT is primarily geared to that market.”When asked about the REIT's distribution plans, Blackstone spokeswoman Paula Chirhart declined to comment. Capped at close to 9%, the cost structure of the new Blackstone REIT is clearly different than the traditional, full-commission nontraded REIT sold mainly product that independent broker-dealer such as LPL Financial and Ameriprise Financial Services Inc. Such REITs typically carry loads of 12%, including a 7% to brokers at the time of sale. Nontraded REITs have been routinely criticized for their high fees and opaque cost structures. Investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co. Inc. estimates $5 billion to $6 billion in nontraded REIT sales this year, or close to half of last year's sales of close to $10 billion.Sales of such REITs have suffered dramatically this year because of two key factors, according to industry executives.First, a new rule by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc., known as 15-02, has made REIT prices more transparent to investors and thus more difficult for brokers to sell. And the coming fiduciary standard for brokers working with client retirement accounts — formally introduced in April by the Department of Labor — is also a key factor in depressing sales.(See: Nontraded REIT sales fall off a cliff as industry struggles to adapt )

Blackstone launches $5B non-traded REIT
New vehicle to focus on low-risk properties



















 August 10, 2016 05:00PM












Stephen Schwarzman (credit: Natalie White)
Blackstone Group launched its first non-traded real estate investment trust and is looking to raise $5 billion from investors.
The new REIT, dubbed Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, will focus on core properties including hotels and multifamily buildings, according to an SEC filing cited by Bloomberg. Blackstone is primarily known as a manager of private investment funds, although it also runs a publicly traded mortgage REIT. The company had $103.2 billion in real estate assets under management as of June 30.
The new REIT appears to be part of Blackstone’s  push into stable, income-producing assets that come with less risk but also offer lower returns. In December, the fund manager bought Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village for $5.3 billion in partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge through a core-plus fund.
“The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said on an earnings call in April, speaking of low-risk real estate. “As we move into the retail chain of distribution with this, we should be able to create a really very large-scale business.”

Blackstone Group, the private equity firm that oversees $368.2 billion of investments, has taken the lead in targeting mom-and-pop investors with its first nontraded real estate investment trust, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Nontraded REITs are marketed to people seeking investments in the commercial real estate industry.
As of April, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust Inc. had raised $755.4 million, or about 40 percent of the money raised by nontraded REITs, according to data from investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co.
Nontraded REITs have faced criticism for charging high fees and providing poor disclosure of risks and fees. Investors complained some traditional nontraded REITs didn’t penalize fund managers for making bad investment decisions. That’s not the case for the Blackstone product.
“If things don’t go well, Blackstone won’t make as much,” Phil Owens, managing director of Green Street Advisors’ consulting unit, told the WSJ. “If things go really well, they make more.”
Green Street historically has recommended that investors buy traded REITs, which are listed on public stock exchanges, because of their better fee structure.
Nontraded REITs were popular used to be popular because of the high dividends they paid when interest rates were near historic lows. But upfront fees that be as much as 15 percent and negative headlines about the collapse of American Realty Capital Partners Inc. damped enthusiasm for the investment products.
Blackstone is marketing its nontraded REIT through major financial groups such as UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch brokerage.
Blackstone this week also disclosed plans to raise $40 billion for an infrastructure fund. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund agreed to commit $20 billion to the pool, which may have more than $100 billion of purchasing power when adding debt.
Blackstone was co-founded by Steven Schwarzman, who is chairman of President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy forum made up of business leaders who advise the White House on jobs and growth.
