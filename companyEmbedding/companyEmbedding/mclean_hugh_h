About
Dr. Hugh-McLean





Dr. Hugh McLean
“(Dr. Hugh) McLean offers a full range of aesthetic services in his full-function clinic (OR and recovery rooms, consultation rooms, private exit to parking). He sees his typical client as the “average working woman” for whom he tries to keep fees, “as reasonable as possible.”According to one of his colleagues, he is a great guy with a “nice, appropriate manner who does good aesthetic work.” — Toronto Life Magazine
Dr. Hugh A. McLean is a plastic surgeon specializing in aesthetic (cosmetic) surgery, with a private practice in Mississauga, Ontario, a city of 700,000 people situated adjacent to Toronto. Because cosmetic surgery improves a person’s physical appearance and self-esteem, Dr. McLean’s philosophy defines plastic surgery as a creative science requiring an understanding of people’s concerns in order to deal with their physical imperfections.
Dr. McLean’s areas of special interest and expertise are facelift, breast enhancement and body sculpting with special emphasis on short-scar facelift, breast augmentation and tummy tuck.









The Clinic’s Medical Aesthetic Division specializes in non-surgical techniques to improve appearance.
Dr. McLean knows the surgical process not only affects the surface: results are felt psychologically and have lasting impact on a person’s lifestyle and well-being.
Taking a caring and relaxed approach, Dr. McLean uses a process of consultation, surgical technique and follow-up to achieve carefully planned and realistic results. He is well-versed in a wide variety of techniques allowing him to tailor solutions to your particular needs. To keep his knowledge and skills up-to-date, Dr. McLean regularly attends national and international conferences.
Dr. McLean is certified as a specialist in plastic surgery by the Royal College of Physicians & Surgeons of Canada and the American Board of Plastic Surgeons, Inc. He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto and completed specialized training in plastic surgery in Toronto and cosmetic surgery in Miami. He has been on staff at the Trillium Health Centre since 1980 and is former Chief of Plastic Surgery at the Mississauga Hospital. He opened his private clinic in 1988.
