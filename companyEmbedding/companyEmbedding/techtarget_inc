TechTarget - Poised For Growth - TechTarget, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTGT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»TechTarget - Poised For GrowthJun. 4.15 | About: TechTarget, Inc. (TTGT) Cobiaman Long/short equity, value




SummaryTechTarget (TTGT) is segmenting its new product, IT Deal Alert, to maximize its addressable market.
        A mostly fixed cost structure means that incremental revenue drops to the bottom line.
        Adjusted EBITDA is poised to grow rapidly as revenue grows.
        TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is a name in which I have summarized the basic business in previous articles. From a numbers perspective, the stock is appealing. It trades at 8.5x 2016E EBITDA with EBITDA growing at a 24% clip in each of 2015 and 2016. There is plenty of headroom in the business model because the company's costs are basically fixed. As such, the company (and we) feel that it can get to a 40% EBITDA margin over time versus 20% in 2014. IT Deal Alert (described below) is 20% of the overall business and is growing at a 50% annual pace. We feel this can drive 15%+ overall top line growth for the foreseeable future. The stock is down significantly recently because their Q1 numbers missed and they lowered guidance for the year. This was due to marketing cuts at their big customers who were faced with revenue shortfalls due to the recent currency headwinds. Even given the lowered guidance, EBITDA will still grow by 24% versus 2014.
What does TechTarget do? In a nutshell, it is an internet company that has 150 different websites focused on the enterprise IT professional. Each website focuses on a slightly different aspect of technology and has content written by the company's 150 editors as well as datasheets and white papers written by IT vendors. The goal of the sites is to educate IT professionals as well as give them a place to do research when they are looking to make an IT purchase.
The company's core business model is to sell leads to its IT vendor customers (think Cisco, HP, IBM, etc.). TTGT has 14 million registered users who frequents its sites and when one of its registered users clicks on a datasheet or whitepaper or podcast supplied by an IT vendor, the company sells that lead to that vendor.

By analyzing the patterns of user traffic over the years, TTGT found that it was able to predict with high accuracy when an enterprise IT firm was looking to make an imminent purchase of IT equipment. It then took this information and actually confirmed if it was true with the enterprise IT firm, and gathered more data from them such as the size of the purchase, the incumbent vendors, and who was currently lined up as the top candidates.
It took all of this information and started selling it on a subscription basis to the IT vendors as a product called IT Deal Alert. This basic product has gone from no revenue two years ago to 20% of TTGT's business today. As time has gone by and TechTarget has gathered feedback from its customers, it has begun to segment the basic product so as to maximize its potential with each type of buyer at its end customer.
Qualified Sales Opportunities is the IT Deal Alert product focused on customers' direct salesforces which need actionable leads with as much information as possible. Qualified Sales Opportunities for the Channel is a version of this product directed at IT vendor channel partners.
Priority Engine is made for inside sales and marketing teams and is integrated with Salesforce.com to help customers prioritize their sales leads. Deal Data is for data scientists at large customers and is a direct upload of all of TTGT's raw purchase intent data.
On its last conference call TechTarget announced a new product that will be rolling out in the fall. This product will use TTGT's post-deal data to give very rapid and accurate reads of market share and pricing data and this information will be sold to both IT vendors and also the investment community.
IT Deal Alert overall in all of its forms is still a nascent offering from TechTarget and has a lot of room to run. This revenue ramp will result in increasing EBITDA and EPS at the company and this in turn will drive the share price. We feel that 15x EBITDA is a fair multiple for the company given its growth rate and as such, our price target is $15.25 (67% upside) on 2016 numbers and $17.80 (94% upside) on 2017 numbers.
