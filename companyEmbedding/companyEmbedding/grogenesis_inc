GroGenesis Inc. Announces Memorandum of Understanding with Curewel International Co. Ltd. as Master Distributor of AgraBurst PRO in Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Laos



Agriculture Technology Company Expands Global Distributor Network

/EINPresswire.com/ -- SIOUX FALLS, SD--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) -  GroGenesis, Inc. (OTCQB: GROG) (the "Company"), a global agriculture technology company and producer of AgraBurst PRO™, an organic, non-GMO nano-surfactant for farmers, fertilizer manufacturer and commercial lawn and turf companies, announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Curewel International for the distribution of AgraBurst PRO in the South East Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. 
AgraBurst PRO™ is a proprietary, all-natural, non-GMO agricultural input which improves the ability of the plant (crops, fruit trees, palms, etc.) to efficiently access applied nutrients incorporated in fertilizers, resulting in less fertilizer required, improved water retention in the soil (thereby increasing drought tolerance) and increasing yields and farmer's income. By optimizing the plant's uptake of applied pest and weed controls and fertilizers, food producers and groundskeepers can minimize other input costs, reduce the health risk to workers and, in the case of crops, produce healthy food for consumers. AgraBurst PRO™ is formulated for organic and non-GMO producers and those food growers seeking to convert to non-GMO and organic food production.
Sandeep Majumdar, President of Curewel International, said, "Farmers in developing countries need to have access to AgraBurst PRO. After seeing the field testing results from other countries in South East Asia and South America, we wanted to be instrumental in introducing this environmentally-friendly input that is not only organic, but also generates higher yields for the farmer trying to increase his family's income. The cost to the farmer is insignificant when considering the higher crop production numbers."
Mr. Majumdar added, "With more than twenty five years of experience in building distributor networks through South East Asia, we are confident that we can work with GroGenesis in expanding AgaBurst PRO's reach to a region of the world crying out for an effective non-chemical agricultural input". 
Mr. Richard Kamolvathin, President and CEO/CSO of GroGenesis, said "GroGenesis welcomes our newest partner in South East Asia, Curewel International, to our rapidly growing family of sustainable agricultural worldwide partnerships. Mr. Majumdar has extensive experience in building distribution networks for various commercial and consumer products. GroGenesis needs this expertise and experience to access remote markets and develop a multi national distribution network in a cost effective way that fits with our business model. Lower chemical inputs, less environmental impact, higher yields, premium market prices for Non-GMO and organic produce and grains increase farmers' income. These are our mutual goals." 
Mr. Kamolvathin concluded, "Farmers can now decide to rehabilitate their soil with a cost-efficient organic input and, at the same time, enjoy greater yields and higher returns on their crops. 
"The opportunities to help farmers around the world transition from conventional chemical farming toward Non-GMO and, ultimately organic, are in great need. Global food security will continue to be under stress and green science will continue to see increased demand. We are looking forward to moving towards a definitive agreement with Curewel International once we complete our due diligence process."

GROGENESIS INC (OTCBB:GROG) Positions AgraBlast As Plant Health Product Innovation



By Ernest Bun
•    March 19, 2015



GROGENESIS INC (OTCBB:GROG) developers, manufacturers and rights holders of unique plant health enhancement goods, announced the brand launch of AgraBlast. It is a unique and effective fungicide designed that had to be used along with AgraBurst™ to provide a non-toxic, eco-friendly application for plant health on extensive industrial scale.
The details of the product
GroGenesis’s product AgraBlast is a liquid form of broad-spectrum algaecide, fungicide and bactericide, product for use in agricultural applications. It provides efficient results when it comes in contact with the surface. The application leaves no residue after use. It has been particularly manufactured for the control and prevention of several horticultural diseases and pathogens. The product provides fast control of infection and offers surface sanitation of hardware. It can be used on a number of hardware including tools and storage buildings.
The key features
AgraBlast of GroGenesis is an eco-friendly product that breaks down into natural elements. It leaves no residue, odor or other fatal effects on plants or commodities. However, it needs to be used in accordance with the given directions on the label and other application guidelines. Although it should be used alone and cannot be mixed with other types of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides or herbicides, when used in combination with AgraBurst, can be much more effective. It can improve the integrity of crops and revitalize diseased parts on infected crops.
Tested product
Mr. Joseph Fewer of GroGenesis said that AgraBlast has been field experimented on several different cash crops. The company was invited to test product efficacy on coffee crops infected with CLR in Central Africa. It is one the growing problems in coffee crops globally. The plants were successfully tested with AgraBlast and AgraBurst. Both the products are biodegradable and relatively inexpensive. It serves as a better alternative over synthetic fungicides. The traditional products use copper-based products in the treatment and are quite expensive.

SIOUX FALLS, SD, Jul 14, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- SIOUX FALLS, SD--(Marketwired - Jul 14, 2017) - GroGenesis, Inc. (otcqb:GROG) (the "Company"), a global sustainable solutions company and producer of AgraBurst PRO™, an organic, non-GMO nano-surfactant for farmers, fertilizer manufacturers and commercial lawn and turf companies, announced today the first shipments of AgraBurst PRO to Genesis Caribbean Solutions, Inc., the exclusive distributor of GroGenesis Inc's proprietary AgraBurst PRO™ in Cuba and the Caribbean. The initial shipments are to the Barbados Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (BADMC). The Barbados Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation was established in 1993 as a Statutory Organization of the Barbados Ministry of Agriculture with the mission to develop agriculture through innovative technological applications, technical and marketing research, and create opportunities for investment in sustainable agricultural enterprises.  AgraBurst PRO™ is a proprietary, all-natural, non-GMO agricultural input which improves the ability of the plant (ie. crops, turf/grasses, trees and grape vines) to efficiently access applied nutrients incorporated in fertilizers, resulting in less fertilizer required, improved water retention in the soil (thereby increasing drought tolerance) and increasing yields and farmer's income. By optimizing the plant's uptake of applied pest and weed controls and fertilizers, food producers and groundskeepers can minimize other input costs, reduce the health risk to workers and, in the case of crops, produce healthy food for consumers. AgraBurst PRO™ is formulated for organic and non-GMO producers and those food growers seeking to convert to non-GMO and organic food production. AgraBurst PRO™ also provides turf maintenance companies servicing homeowners, resorts, parks and golf courses with an organic input to improve the health and appearance of lawns and landscapes.  Ernesto Reyes, Director of GroGenesis Caribbean Solutions, Inc., said, "After field testing on okra and sugarcane was conducted to confirm AgraBurst PRO's impressive increases on crop yield and the positive organic effects on the health of the soil, BADMC ordered product to distribute to Barbadian farmers. We look forward to expanding field testing with BADMC to include additional crops to build a long term relationship with the Barbados agricultural industry."  Shawn Prestie, Director of GroGenesis Caribbean Solutions, Inc., added, "Farmers can benefit from increased yields and, therefore, increased net income, while adopting healthy farming practices through the use of this 100% organic input. At GroGenesis Caribbean, we are honored to be a part of Barbados' commitment to its sustainable agriculture initiatives. We will be exhibiting AgraBurst PRO at the Havana International Fair (FIHAV) this November to further develop AgraBurst PRO's position in the sustainable agriculture marketplace throughout the Caribbean."  Mr. Richard Kamolvathin, President and CEO of GroGenesis, Inc., said, "With these orders from Barbados, GroGenesis has transitioned from a pre-revenue company with a new product to a revenue producing growth company with operating cash flow. This fiscal quarter ending September 30 will be the first quarter to report revenue.  "We have been working diligently in conducting the requisite field tests in a number of countries to validate the significant yield increases documented. Now we are working towards obtaining more orders from our distribution network, in addition to expanding that network to include additional countries."  Kamolvathin concluded, "Shareholders can now look forward to more frequent communications from management regarding our corporate progress."

GroGenesis Inc (OTCMKTS:GROG) To Refine The Market Segmentation For Its Products

June 19, 2015

Business
No comments



GroGenesis Inc (OTCMKTS:GROG) reported that as a part of its underway business development plan it has decided to refine the commercial roll out potential and refine the market segmentation for its first two products, AgraBlast and AgraBurst.
The company conducted internal studies and decided to increase market awareness in the budding biostimulant sector. It is one of the growing and recent industry classifications that reflect great potential as an agricultural network of commercial adoption and new technological advancements.
The highlights
Within few years since its inception, the EBIC suggests that over 3 million hectares are treated with repetitive biostimulant treatments in Europe annually. MarketsandMarkets of Dallas states that the value of the global biostimulants market is estimated to increase to $2.5 billion in next four years.
Market Publishers of Birmingham suggests the biostimulants market in North America is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% in next five years. Therefore, GroGenesis plans to focus on initiating deals with prospective biostimulant distributors that are well positioned to target North American and European associates seeking to increase crop yields via the development of regional treatment plans featuring AgraBurst.
The expert view
GroGenesis’s CEO Joe Fewer said that they consider the biostimulant industry has come a long way in short timeframe. The management looks forward to work diligently with the new and unique technologies just appearing at the forefront of the agricultural segment as a whole.
Crop remediation and protection products integrated with unique health enhancement plans are appearing to be the future of agriculture segment in more stressed global environment. The company’s measures and similar efforts of others like GroGenesis should have considerable impact on future generations.

The final closing price of the day shows a change of 0.24% only, almost unchanged and no real significant movement for the day for GroGenesis Inc (OTCMKTS:GROG) but the technical structure tells us otherwise. The stock closed almost at the day low after an 11% decline from the day high, indicating absolute failure to sustain the higher levels, which was also higher than the range of last two weeks. The price action in the last month took the form of a Triangle pattern with a lot of contraction but the breakout took place too close to the apex and failed.

This means less fertilizer can be employed more efficiently, resulting in cost savings and decreased soil & water impact.By applying our AgraBurstPRO™ product, the natural surfactant properties of foliage are increased, enabling quicker and more efficient absorption of light, water and nutrients at the cellular level. Studies show AgraBurst™ raises plant sugar levels, improves insect resistance, facilitates absorption, improves drought resistance and produces faster growing, more uniform crop stands with larger root systems.AgraBurstPRO™ simultaneously rebuilds the soil by enhancing nutrient availability and exchange capacity. In other words, the product conditions and complements soil by reinforcing its mineral substructure. Field studies in SE Asia, Central and North America demonstrate shorter plant germination time, increased growth and improved disease resistance.AgraBurstPRO is a colloid, not a dissolved solution. It is the chassis or the physical action required to improve nutrient mobility in crops by dramatically reducing the surface tension of water and plant nutrient solutions.  AgraBurst works primarily as a nutrient and moisture pathway inside the crop's xylem and phloem circulation system.  The significant benefit of AgraBurst is its ability to increase plants natural sugar production and effectively transport nutrients photosynthetically to leaf cells and roots.  AgraBurst is a ion exchange delivery formula that moves NPK nutrients and trace elements by reducing surface tension and viscosity in plant sugar creating a natural pathway to transport nutrients and sugars through leaf, stems and roots with minimal energy. AgraBurst is a cost efficient way to deliver proprietary plant technology to plant, soil or seed.  GroGenesis utilizes only the highest food grade ingredients and assures quality and consistency control through our relationship with a national OMRI certified mixer. 
Free of toxic or hazardous components, and containing no hormones, heavy metals, pesticides, or carcinogens, AgraBurstPRO™ is suitable for use in any soil or region, and is safe for all plants, humans and animals.

Announces Memorandum of Understanding with Curewel International Co. Ltd. as Master Distributor of AgraBurst PRO in Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and LaosMarketwiredJuly 25, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSIOUX FALLS, SD--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) - GroGenesis, Inc. (  OTCQB :  GROG ) (the "Company"), a global agriculture technology company and producer of AgraBurst PRO™, an organic, non-GMO nano-surfactant for farmers, fertilizer manufacturer and commercial lawn and turf companies, announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Curewel International for the distribution of AgraBurst PRO in the South East Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. AgraBurst PRO™ is a proprietary, all-natural, non-GMO agricultural input which improves the ability of the plant (crops, fruit trees, palms, etc.) to efficiently access applied nutrients incorporated in fertilizers, resulting in less fertilizer required, improved water retention in the soil (thereby increasing drought tolerance) and increasing yields and farmer's income. By optimizing the plant's uptake of applied pest and weed controls and fertilizers, food producers and groundskeepers can minimize other input costs, reduce the health risk to workers and, in the case of crops, produce healthy food for consumers. AgraBurst PRO™ is formulated for organic and non-GMO producers and those food growers seeking to convert to non-GMO and organic food production.Sandeep Majumdar, President of Curewel International, said, "Farmers in developing countries need to have access to AgraBurst PRO. After seeing the field testing results from other countries in South East Asia and South America, we wanted to be instrumental in introducing this environmentally-friendly input that is not only organic, but also generates higher yields for the farmer trying to increase his family's income. The cost to the farmer is insignificant when considering the higher crop production numbers."Mr. Majumdar added, "With more than twenty five years of experience in building distributor networks through South East Asia, we are confident that we can work with GroGenesis in expanding AgaBurst PRO's reach to a region of the world crying out for an effective non-chemical agricultural input".Mr. Richard Kamolvathin, President and CEO/CSO of GroGenesis, said "GroGenesis welcomes our newest partner in South East Asia, Curewel International, to our rapidly growing family of sustainable agricultural worldwide partnerships. Mr. Majumdar has extensive experience in building distribution networks for various commercial and consumer products. GroGenesis needs this expertise and experience to access remote markets and develop a multi national distribution network in a cost effective way that fits with our business model. Lower chemical inputs, less environmental impact, higher yields, premium market prices for Non-GMO and organic produce and grains increase farmers' income. These are our mutual goals."Mr. Kamolvathin concluded, "Farmers can now decide to rehabilitate their soil with a cost-efficient organic input and, at the same time, enjoy greater yields and higher returns on their crops. "The opportunities to help farmers around the world transition from conventional chemical farming toward Non-GMO and, ultimately organic, are in great need. Global food security will continue to be under stress and green science will continue to see increased demand. We are looking forward to moving towards a definitive agreement with Curewel International once we complete our due diligence process."Investor Database for Future Press Releases and Industry UpdatesInterested investors and shareholders are invited to be added to the corporate e-mail database for corporate press releases and periodic industry updates by sending an email to info@grogenesis.com.About Curewel International Co., Ltd.
