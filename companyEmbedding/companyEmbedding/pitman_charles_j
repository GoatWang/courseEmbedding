CHARLES J. PITMAN, 74, joined the company’s board of directors in May 2000. Pitman served as lead director from February 2013 until May 2015 and is a member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Management Development and Compensation Committee.
Pitman retired from BP Amoco plc in late 1999. During his 24-year career at Amoco and BP Amoco, Pitman served in a variety of leadership positions in the United States and multiple international locations, principally in the Middle East. Notably, Pitman served as president of Amoco Egypt Oil Company from 1992 to 1996, president of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company from 1997 to 1998, and regional president BP Amoco plc - Middle East/Caspian/Egypt/India from December 1998 until his retirement in 1999.
Prior to joining Amoco, Pitman served in the United States Department of State as a Foreign Service officer and attorney-adviser.
Since his retirement from BP Amoco, Pitman served as a non-executive director and chairman of Urals Energy Public Company Limited, an oil exploration and production company operating in Russia, from 2005 until 2009; chairman of the board of First Calgary Petroleums Ltd., an oil and gas exploration company engaged in exploration and development activities in Algeria in 2008; and sole member of Shaker Mountain Energy Associates LLC from 1999 to 2007.
Having served in executive and director capacities at Amoco and BP Amoco in numerous international locations, particularly Egypt, Pitman has valuable experience in and knowledge of the oil and gas industry in the Middle East, Russia and North Africa.
Pitman’s vast experience in international oil and gas and the knowledge and relationships he developed while serving in the U.S. State Department provide valuable insight for the benefit of Apache’s operations, both domestic and abroad.

Biography
Mr. Sprigman served two years active duty as a line infantry officer, mainly at Ft. Knox, KY, from 1964 to 1966. Mr. Sprigman earned an Expert Infantry Badge (EIB) and several other commendations while on active duty. He left active duty as a first lieutenant. He worked in a business setting from his discharge from the Army in June 1966 to September 1968. Mr. Sprigman actively has practiced law in New Jersey since 1971.
Mr. Sprigman was appointed by the New Jersey Supreme Court to its Civil Practice Committee and served three years on that committee and thereafter eight years on the Supreme Court Committee on Civil Jury Charges. In addition, he sat for four years as a member of the District Ethics Committee. Mr. Sprigman has served his community for eight and a half years, as a Councilman in the Borough of Wenonah, has been a trustee of the Wenonah Swim Club, and on the Administrative Board of the Kemble Methodist Church. Mr. Sprigman also served as a Municipal Court Judge for 18 years.
Mr. Charles J. Sprigman has been named the winner of the Best Attorney category in the 2014 and 2015 Best of Gloucester County Awards. The awards are based on an independent public opinion poll and are sponsored by the Gloucester County Board of Chosen Freeholders, Gloucester County Chamber of Commerce and the South Jersey Times.
Mr. Sprigman believes that the law is about honesty and integrity, without which the law would have no true meaning. He has proudly and successfully handled thousands of matrimonial cases, hundreds of probate cases, and thousands more in miscellaneous cases.

If you’ve been involved in an auto accident, call us now!

Millions of vehicle accidents occur every year in the United States. When you’re in a car wreck, life changes. The results can be devastating. Many people experience the stress of medical bills, lost wages and dealing with car repairs. That’s why we’re here. If you’ve been involved in an auto accident, call us now! We’ll work to cut through the insurance company red tape and fight to get you the settlement you deserve.
Many injured people delay getting legal help and hope the insurance company will give them a fair settlement. However, according to the Insurance Research Council, people that hire a lawyer receive 3 1/2 times more money than those who tried to settle their claim themselves. If you’ve been involved in an accident, you only get one chance to get the settlement you deserve. Before you sign any papers or speak to anyone, call Charles G. Pitman Attorneys at Law.
