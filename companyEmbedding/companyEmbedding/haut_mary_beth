Haut will be based at Acadia Trust’s Portland offices, located at 5 Milk St., and will lead all of its investment and trust services throughout New England in Portland.
Haut joins Acadia Trust from Citizens Private Bank, the private banking division of Citizens Bank, where she was senior vice president and market executive for the state of Massachusetts. Before that, she was the senior vice president and division executive of the company’s wealth management arm. Her additional experience includes senior-level wealth management roles at FleetBoston and Bank Boston (now Bank of America).
A certified financial planner, Haut received her bachelor’s degree from Colby College in Waterville. She and her husband, Tom, have two children, Catherine and Thomas.
Midcoast Conservancy appoints Youth Conservation Corps leader
Brianna Smith has joined the Midcoast Conservancy staff as crew leader for the agency’s summer Youth Conservation Corps. She brings a wealth of experience and commitment to environmental issues to her work overseeing erosion mitigation projects on Damariscotta Lake, according to a news release from the agency.
Brianna is a native of Monmouth and a graduate of the University of Maine, in Orono, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in marine science. She is pursuing a second degree in civil engineering at UMaine, where, she says, “I plan to combine my background in water science with engineering to protect Maine’s natural legacy through improved drainage infrastructure. With proper drainage of paved areas, stream-road crossings and shorefront properties, water quality of our lakes and rivers can be protected. In addition, proper drainage can reduce the risk of floods and increase resiliency to environmental challenges like land development and climate change.” 
Brianna’s background dovetails with the work of the Youth Conservation Corps Buffer Brigade of Midcoast Conservancy. The YCC crew spends the summer installing anti-erosion projects around the shores of Damariscotta Lake at the homes of residents who are committed to making their properties as lake-friendly as possible. Anyone interested in an evaluation of their property can contact Midcoast Conservancy’s Watershed Protection Specialist Garrison Beck at 389-5157 or [email protected]
Wayne business wins first place for new specialty product at food show
Grey Goose Gourmet, a small pepper jelly business in Wayne, recently won first place for the Best New Specialty Food Product at the 2016 New England Made Giftware & Specialty Food Show, according to a news release from the company.
Grey Goose Gourmet was one of many companies competing for the best food product and giftware awards at the Portland show in March. Store buyers from 20 states — including large retail businesses such as Williams Sonoma and L.L. Bean — judged the products.
“The judges were seasoned buyers who understand what will sell in their shops,” said Stefa Normantas, managing partner of New England Made Shows. “Sandra was competing against some well established specialty foods like Stonewall Kitchen, Haven’s Candies, Harbor Sweets and Raye’s Mustard. She definitely earned bragging rights and should go home very proud of herself.”
Sandra started her business two years ago when she began making pepper jelly from a family recipe. She now makes nine varieties and eight seasonal jellies that she sells at farmers markets, shows, festivals, stores and directly from her website and Wayne home.
Combined Benefits United appoints LaRochelle chief operating officer
Combined Benefits United announced Thursday that Raegan LaRochelle has been appointed chief operating officer for its Maine-based insurance marketing organization in Hallowell. LaRochelle previously worked in both the private and nonprofit sectors, most recently in consulting.
Effective immediately, LaRochelle assumes responsibility in contracting, new business, marketing and advisor related services. LaRochelle is responsible for the alignment and prioritization of company partnerships and ensuring operational excellence across the company.
A native of Augusta, LaRochelle graduated from Cony High School and Bowdoin College. After college, she moved to Philadelphia to work in a business incubator. There, she helped to develop a youth entrepreneurship program that taught high school students how to write business plans and manage micro-enterprises. This experience reinforced her belief that small business development is central to the overall prosperity of local economies. Later, she obtained a Master of Business Administration degree from Yale University’s School of Management, with the goal of working with small businesses and companies.
LaRochelle also volunteers as chairwoman of the Augusta Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, and she serves on the Kennebec Valley YMCA Board of Directors, the Augusta Board of Trade, and Augusta First. She also coaches her twin sons’ soccer and basketball teams.
Maine TV show looking for entrepreneur contestants
Greenlight Maine, the television series designed to promote the entrepreneurs of Maine, is accepting submissions for its second season, according to a news release from Con Fullam, the show’s creator.
The series, which airs statewide at 7:30 p.m. Saturday on WCSH and WLBZ, is about a competition that highlights two entrepreneurs presenting their “big idea” to a panel of experts who listen, weigh in and finally decide which contestant wins the night and moves on for a chance at winning $100,000 in cash. 
Season 1, which is still airing, already has succeeded in securing $1,250,000 in angel investments for companies that have been discovered through the series. Information on how to submit a company for consideration can be found by visiting the Greenlight Maine Facebook page or by visiting the show’s website at www.greenlightmaine.com. 
Hall-Dale, Cony to benefit from Olive Garden Spirit Night
Augusta’s Olive Garden restaurant, located at 205 Civic Center Drive, will donate proceeds from its sales Tuesday to Hall-Dale High School and from sales on April 19 to Cony High School, according to a news release from the company.
On selected dates in April, every Olive Garden restaurant nationwide is hosting a Spirit Night to support a local high school. From 4 to 10 p.m. on the chosen evenings, a portion of all in-restaurant sales will be donated to that school, up to $1,000 per restaurant. Guests are encouraged to wear the school colors and join in the celebration. 
This initiative is in partnership with the NFHS Network, the nation’s leading high school sports media company, and is part of Olive Garden’s ongoing commitment to support its local communities.
Manchester business announces winners of stained glass contest

Camden National Corporation 
By Kim Ratner

						Posted April 07, 2016, at 8:29 a.m. 



 


PORTLAND – Gregory A. Dufour, president and chief executive officer of Camden National Corporation, is pleased to announce that  Mary Beth (Boland) Haut, CFP®, has been named president and chief executive officer of Acadia Trust, N.A., Camden National Corporation’s wealth management subsidiary. She will be based at Acadia Trust’s Portland offices, located at 5 Milk Street, and will lead all of its investment and trust services throughout Maine and New England.
“Mary Beth brings a strong history of experience in comprehensive wealth management, corporate leadership, and financial services with prominent financial institutions in northern New England and her skills align perfectly with what we were looking for in Acadia Trust’s next leader,” said Dufour. “With ties to Maine as well as a deep understanding of the industry, she is uniquely qualified to serve the company’s existing client base and work strategically to help guide it into the future.”
Haut joins Acadia Trust from Citizens Private Bank, the private banking division of Citizens Bank, where she served as senior vice president and market executive for the state of Massachusetts. Prior to that, she served as the senior vice president and division executive of the company’s wealth management arm. Her additional experience includes senior-level wealth management roles at FleetBoston and Bank Boston (now Bank of America).
“I am honored to have the opportunity to work with the talented Acadia Trust team and support our clients in achieving their investment, planning and wealth management objectives,” said Haut.
Throughout her career, Haut has been in client-facing roles and focused on developing and enhancing relationships. “For me, it’s people first,” she added. “Connecting with and caring about people is the key to creating positive, enduring relationships with wealth management clients and colleagues.”
A Certified Financial Planner®, Haut received her bachelor’s degree from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. She and her husband Tom have two children, Catherine and Thomas.
“Maine has always held a special place in my life and is dear to my whole family,” added Haut. “From family hiking and skiing adventures to my college days in Waterville, the state has long been a part of who I am. It feels very natural to make this transition and join the Acadia Trust team. I am delighted to make Portland my new home, and look forward to connecting with clients in all of the Acadia Trust and Camden National markets.”
About Acadia Trust, N.A.
Acadia Trust, N.A. provides comprehensive wealth management, investment management and trust services to individual and institutional clients. From its offices in Portland, Bangor, and Ellsworth, Acadia Trust serves clients throughout Maine and New England.
