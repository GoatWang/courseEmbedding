               Company: Allen-Stevenson School
Job Details
               Company Size: $10 mil to less than $25 mil - Employee Range: 100 to less than 500. The Allen-Stevenson School, founded in 1883, is a non-sectarian elementary school for boys in kindergarten through ninth grade. Located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the School draws just under 400 students from many New York City neighborhoods. Allen-Stevenson is large enough to offer a multifaceted educational experience, and it is small enough to provide a personal atmosphere where each boy is known. At Allen-Stevenson, there are many ways to be a boy and many ways to learn and grow. Our boys distinguish us. Allen-Stevenson specializes in building self-confidence, academic skills, and character in a friendly and intellectually challenging environment. We believe that it is an extraordinary school fulfilling a contemporary mission with a purposeful balance of academics, athletics, and the arts. Few schools for boys match the broad range of our educational program, our very special emphasis on music and the other arts, and our supportive development of the whole boy. In addition to its rigorous academic standards, the School recognizes the basic importance of ethical standards of conduct, citizenship, community service, and mutual trust and respect, all of which are conducive to effective teaching and successful learning. An Allen-Stevenson education fosters a boy's natural intellectual curiosity about himself, about his community, and about the world. As the School's video says, "At Allen-Stevenson we believe that life is inherently interesting and that a good education unlocks its mysteries." Therefore, we value openness to new ideas and self-confidence without arrogance, in the belief that such attitudes enable people to accept the world and explore new solutions to problems that face them. We profess that everyone benefits from being part of a learning community with a diversity of backgrounds, strengths, experiences, and viewpoints. In a time when social roles may be changing, Allen-Stevenson attempts to foster in young men those skills and qualities that will help them deal creatively with change. For example, we prize collaboration as much as competition in all areas, and value interpersonal skills, teamwork, sportsmanship, and friendship along with the development of each individual. The setting we cherish builds on failure as well as success, striving always to create an atmosphere emotionally safe enough to allow boys to try new things, to make mistakes, and to learn from them. We believe that education works best when teachers and parents work together for the good of each boy. Allen-Stevenson enables families not only to meet the early developmental and educational needs of their sons but also, in close consultation with parents, to have the choice of excellent and appropriate high school placements after 8th or 9th grades. Just as this strategic plan establishes goals and priorities for the School's future, we intend to kindle in every boy a passion for excellence, the proven foundation on which to build a productive adult life in the new century. At heart, Allen-Stevenson aspires to establish a life-long attitude of respect for learners and a joyful spirit of learning, qualities that reinforce excellence in every way.
