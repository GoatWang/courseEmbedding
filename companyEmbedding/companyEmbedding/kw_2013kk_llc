		Used and New Diesel Generators  
                 


				WPP offers a wide selection of quality diesel generators in sizes ranging from 20kW – 2500kW. Whether you seek portable or stationary diesel generators―for prime, continuous or standby usage―we can ensure you find what you are looking for.
The simplest explanation of a generator’s function: it provides electrical power. A diesel generator is the combination of a diesel engine with an alternator (also called a generator end) to generate electrical energy.   This alternator houses electrical conductors which react to the engine’s mechanical energy and convert it into useful electrical power.
We have many informative articles describing how generators work and which to choose for a particular application.

                                        Fees & News   Bulletins CMS MLN Connects Email List Sign Up FAQs Fee Schedules Latest Updates                              Modifiers KK, KG, KU and KW used under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program - Revised   MLN Matters® Number: MM9059 Revised Related Change Request (CR) #: CR 9059 Related CR Release Date: March 27, 2015 Effective Date: July 1, 2015 Related CR Transmittal #: R1482OTN Implementation Date: July 6, 2015  This article was revised on May 22, 2015, to reflect a revised Change Request (CR) 9059. That CR revised the remittance advice messages for adjusted claims. The transmittal number, CR release date and link to the CR also changed. All other information remains the same.  Provider Types Affected   This MLN Matters® Article is intended for DMEPOS suppliers submitting claims to Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MACs) for DMEPOS provided to Medicare beneficiaries under the competitive bidding program.  Provider Action Needed   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued Change Request (CR) 9059 to limit the use of modifiers KK, KG, KU, and KW on DMEPOS claims billed under the Competitive Bidding Program to only those uses allowed by current policy. This will reduce the number of overpayments made as a result of improper use by suppliers. Make sure your billing staffs are aware of these changes.  Background   Congress mandated the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected DMEPOS items with a competitive bid process. The intent is to improve the effectiveness of the Medicare methodology for setting DMEPOS payment amounts, which will reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses and save the Medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services.  Under the program, a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted. Suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products. Not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding. Bids are submitted electronically through a web-based application process and required documents are mailed. Bids are evaluated based on the supplier's eligibility, its financial stability and the bid price. Contracts are awarded to the Medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards. Contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount. The amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item.  The competitive bidding modifiers were created to identify a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) supply or accessory code that is considered both a competitive bid item and a non-competitive bid item in the same Competitive Bidding Area (CBA). Competitive bid items are identified with the appropriate modifiers in the HCPCS and pricing files available at http://dmecompetitivebid.com/palmetto/cbic.nsf/DocsCat/Home  on the Internet.  When billing for beneficiaries that reside in a CBA, suppliers should only apply modifiers KG and KK to competitive bid HCPCS codes according to current policy instructions for use of these modifiers. HCPCS codes designated as valid for use with these modifiers are listed in the Single Payment Public Use Files available at http://dmecompetitivebid.com/palmetto/cbic.nsf/DocsCat/Home  on the Internet.  Modifiers KU and KW are not currently authorized for supplier billing use and do not currently appear on the single payment file as valid for use with any DMEPOS HCPCS.  Key Point   Your DME MAC will allow claims for competitive bid items when billed with modifiers KG, KK, KU or KW only when the HCPCS/modifier combination is listed as valid on the CBIC HCPCS file. The DME MACs will return as unprocessable claims for competitive bid items when billed with modifiers KG, KK, KU or KW when the HCPCS/modifier combination is not listed as valid on the CBIC HCPCS file.  DME MACs will use the following messages when returning as unprocessable claims for competitive bid items inappropriately billed with modifiers KG, KK, KU or KW:   Group Code CO  CARC 4 – "The procedure code is inconsistent with the modifier used or a required modifier is missing."  RARC MA13 – "Alert: You may be subject to penalties if you bill the patient for amounts not reported with the PR (patient responsibility) group code."  RARC MA130 – "Your claim contains incomplete and/or invalid information, and no appeal rights are afforded because the claim is unprocessable. Please submit a new claim with the complete/correct information."   Note that MACs will also deny adjustment claim lines containing HCPCS inappropriately billed with modifiers KG, KK, KU, or KW.  DME MACs will use the following messages when denying adjustment claim lines containing HCPCS inappropriately billed with modifiers KG, KK, KU, or KW:   Group Code CO  CARC 4 – "The procedure code the modifier used or a required modifier is missing."  RARC MA13 – "Alert: You may be subject to penalties if you bill the patient for amounts not reported with the PR (patient responsibility) group code."  RARC N211 – "Alert: You may not appeal this decision."   Additional Information   The official instruction for CR9059 issued to your DME MAC regarding this change is available at http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R1482OTN.pdf  on the CMS website.  For more information regarding the appropriate use of Competitive Bidding modifiers, see Medicare Learning Network (MLN) article SE1035 titled: "Claims Modifiers for Use in the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program" at http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/SE1035.pdf  on the CMS website.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
