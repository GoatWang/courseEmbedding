History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]
Products[1][edit]
Soft Pretzels[edit]
JJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Certain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.
All of JJSF’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
In the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.
Frozen Juice Treats and Desserts[edit]
JJSF’s frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment.

The Corner Office: Gerald Shreiber, CEO, J&J Snack Foods

by Cory Todd

			In 1971, Gerald Shreiber purchased the J&J Pretzel Co. for about $73,000 at a bankruptcy auction. Today, the Pennsauken company is known as J&JSnack Foods—producer of Superpretzel, ICEE, Minute Maid frozen lemonade and many other tasty brands—does sales of nearly $750 million annually. Shreiber grew the company through acquisitions, then, in 1985, took it public on the Nasdaq—and watched sales grow to surpass the $25 million mark that same year. The company works across the retail, wholesale and food service industries, and saw income growth of 17.2 percent in fiscal 2010 alone. As chairman and chief executive, Shreiber remains active in the company and is the largest shareholder; he believes his 21 percent ownership lets him retain the feel of a family business. 

Management philosophy: “A long time ago, we established a criteria to build a successful organization: to make niche products, be the low-cost producer and expand the launching and distribution channels. Along with that, I want to get good people, to find those people who have that fire in the belly, have the smarts and want to work hard, and give them opportunities with our company. I try to give those people enough room to operate and perform. Our company started with eight employees in 1971—and today, through hard work, organic growth, acquisitions and recruiting good people, we’re now 2,700 people strong.”

Key to making smart acquisitions: “We are very careful and deliberate in vetting the company and the products that they have. And certainly the culture, because even though we’re a publicly traded company, our culture is like that of a family. There are companies we looked at, but for one reason or another—not price or economics—it wasn’t the right fit. We’re the largest soft pretzel company in the world today and we have acquired within that industry because, one, it fit within our business model; two, it gave us some tangible and intangible benefits in marketing, production and quality; and three, it was part of our growth.” 

On fostering business relationships: “Make sure that you establish and maintain the relationship from day one. Do whatever you can for the customer. My father was a produce merchant, and if we were selling three pounds of potatoes for so much, he’d say, ‘Gerry, give a little more.’  If it was five pounds of bananas, give the customer five and a quarter. Not to the point that it becomes a bad business practice but to the point that you satisfy the customer and do what you can for them and constantly build the relationship.”

On licensing: “We’ve been fortunate over the years in licensing. A number of years ago we had an opportunity to work with the Paul Newman group and make product for them, and that business has grown. We also have a license from Kraft, and one of the most successful licenses that we’ve had has been Minute Maid which was a networking opportunity. That was a product that was well known, even though everybody thinks of orange juice and liquid products, but we have the exclusive license to produce and sell anything Minute Maid frozen. We thought at the time it was a huge opportunity and it turns out we were right. It’s a recognizable product line and expanding product line.”

Most profound business advice: “My father gave me a lot of advice, things like work hard, take care of the customer, say thank you, pick up pennies and stretch a dollar. I didn’t have the good fortune of going to college, but I believe in education and I made it a point that all of my people have available to them a scholarship assistance plan, and we will pay for their schooling. And we just require that they attend the course and use their best efforts, and stay with the company for a certain period of time after they get their degree. That scholarship program is named in my father’s honor, the Nathan Shreiber Scholarship Plan.”

Recommended business book: “I read a lot. Right now I’m reading Money and Power by William D. Cohan, because when I look at the calamity that was created a couple of years ago within the markets, I want to know why it happened. Everybody who’s in business was impacted by what happened only two short years ago when suddenly the financial credit markets froze. It really reads like a drama. In the summer I can read three or four books at a time when I’m sitting out at the pool enjoying the hot weather. I read Time and The New York Times and sports magazines and I do a lot of business reading.” 

Preferred snack: “It’s tough to pick just one, like choosing your favorite child. I love biscuits in the morning, but I don’t eat them that often because I’ve got to watch my weight and I have Type II diabetes. But there are times my mouth waters for our Mary B’s biscuits. But I also love our soft pretzels and our bakery products—and our churros!”

History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]

MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

Apply to the Pet Therapy Program.
At the present time, we only offer pet therapy at the Main Campus in Philadelphia.
The Gerald B. Shreiber Pet Therapy Program originated from the belief that dogs offer a therapeutic value to children that human family members and hospital staff cannot give.
This program gives children the opportunity to interact safely with the dogs and receive their unconditional love and acceptance in the hopes of making the hospital environment more comfortable and less stressful.
Our program involves trained volunteers and their dogs who visit the children at CHOP. Additional benefits of pet therapy are:
Positive therapeutic experiences that help minimize the stress of the hospital environment
Support of the overall social, physical and emotional development of the child 
Reduced anxiety and enhanced coping skills by providing a distraction from illness and hospitalization 
Increased normalization of the hospital experience by making it more "home-like" 
Pet therapy volunteer requirements
Because we are a healthcare organization, there are some requirements you must fulfill before you can volunteer at the Gerald B. Shreiber Pet Therapy Program at CHOP. For the safety of our patients, their families, and for you, we ask all potential volunteers be able to commit to the following:
Age. To become a pet therapy volunteer, you must be 18 years or older, and your dog must be at least 1 year old.
Registration. We require that all therapy dogs and handlers have a current registration with Pet Partners, Therapy Dogs International, Therapy Dogs Inc. or Comfort Caring Canines. If your dog is not a registered therapy dog with one of these groups, there are links and contact information for them at the bottom of this page.
Time Commitment. We ask pet therapy volunteers to commit to a minimum of one two-hour shift per month.
Interview and Screening. We conduct a phone interview and/or a one-on-one interview with applicants. All dogs must be medically and behaviorally screened through The Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania at no charge to the owner. A portion of the cost of animal healthcare is underwritten by The Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania.
Background Check. Per Pennsylvania Act 73, acceptance to the volunteer program is contingent upon completing FBI Fingerprinting. We also require completion of a complete criminal background check and Child Abuse Clearances prior to acceptance into our volunteer program. These clearances will be facilitated by CHOP if you are selected to volunteer. Clearance results can take up to 6 weeks to receive.
Health Clearances. All human volunteers are required to prove immunity to mumps, measles, rubella, and chicken pox, as well as a Tdap vaccination. Volunteers are also required to receive an annual tuberculosis (TB) skin test and the seasonal flu vaccine. The annual tuberculosis test and seasonal flu vaccinations are provided free of charge at CHOP. All dog volunteers are required to have current vaccinations and rabies boosters. Dog cannot be on a raw foods diet at any time during their participation in the program. Raw food diets present an increased risk of pathologic bacterial and protozoal shedding and infection that can compromise the health of our patients. Veterinarian records must be updated twice a year (once a year at VHUP and once a year at your personal vet). If your dog spends any time in a kennel or becomes ill, a fecal sample needs to be cleared through VHUP (the appropriate collection container will be provided). Dogs must be washed within 24 hours of the visit and dry upon entering the hospital (please refrain from using any flea and tick topical 2 days prior to visit).
Orientation and Training. Once volunteer teams are cleared, they will also be required to attend a two hour Unit/Patient Care Orientation. Volunteers will be escorted on their first three visits by the program coordinator, and may also be asked to complete additional training as required.
Restrictions. Volunteers must abide by all patient confidentiality guidelines, customer service expectations and hospital policies. Dog must be on a leash (except with obedience exercises which must be previously approved), not pushed in any type of stroller, or transported in any type of carrier. Dogs with missing or paralyzed limbs may utilize a doggie wheelchair. For identification purposes, your dog must wear a CHOP bandana (provided to you) at all times while in the hospital.

Shreiber, Gerald B. - The Wall Street Transcript











































 





































Gerald B. Shreiber
GERALD B. SHREIBER, President and CEO of J&J Snack Foods Corp., began
his business career rather auspiciously, starting as a machine shop
trainee with Kulicke & Soffa, a manufacturer of semiconductor assembly
equipment, in 1960. He ultimately held positions in inventory,
production and sales management before leaving the firm in 1968 to start
his own business, manufacturing specialty machine parts. Mr. Shreiber
sold his company in 1970 and stayed on until 1971. J&J Snack Foods Corp.
was formed in September 1971 by Mr. Shreiber after he purchased a local
bankrupt soft pretzel company. He initiated product improvements,
developed marketing and equipment programs, and established a national
distribution system. Other products were added, and in the late 1970s
and 1980s, small but key turnaround acquisitions followed. In 1986 J&J
went public. In November 1987 and again in 1991, J&J earned a ranking on
the Forbes list of the 200 best small companies in America. Mr. Shreiber
has served on the Board of Directors of the Jewish Community Center of
Atlantic County, NJ and also as Chairman of the fundraising committee.
He is Chairman of the State of Israel Notes for Atlantic county. He is
also a Founder of the American Associates, Ben Gurion University of the
Negev in Israel and is a member of the Board of the Federation of Jewish
Charities. He is a Director of the North American Wildlife Park
Foundation in Battle Ground, Indiana. He is a member of World Wildlife
Fund, National Wildlife Federation American Anti-Vivisection Society,
International Fund for Animal Welfare, Animal Welfare Institute,
Greenpeace, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and
several other preservation and animal welfare organizations.
