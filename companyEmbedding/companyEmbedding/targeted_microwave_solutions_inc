TMS® is a clean technology company which designs and manufactures vertical  WAVEdri® microwave reactors to dry and process industrial aggregates and commodity materials in some of the world’s largest industries. Our mission is to revolutionize industrial drying by providing a cleaner and more efficient technology.  We eliminate drying related polluting emissions from burning fossil fuels, reduce reduce energy waste and replace traditional drying machinery that is expensive and has a large footprint, while improving the financial performance of our customers. 








WAVEdri® Technology

Drying systems, no matter how complex, all have the same core function - they remove moisture from a material. However, very few reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are more efficient, generate water and are cost-effective like the WAVEdri® 3.0.  These technology advancements are the catalyst to the paradigm shift in industrial drying technologies.

Targeted Microwave Solutions Inc.Listing Exchange: CSEStatus: DelistedIndustry: TechnologySymbol: TMSCSE Index: Currency:  
	Targeted Microwave Solutions Inc. (“TMS” or the “Company”) is the developer of a proprietary material processing technology that utilizes dielectric (microwave) heating to upgrade the commercial value of raw materials and industrial aggregates such as renewable biomass, mineral ores, clays, and high moisture sub-bituminous and lignite coals. Unlike traditional microwave technologies that process materials on a horizontal conveyor belt, the TMS system is based on a vertical platform with no moving parts, allowing for the handling and microwave processing of industrial aggregates at high throughput rates. By heating materials from the “inside-out”, the TMS technology possesses a unique advantage over traditional thermal drying technologies, including the ability to heat, dehydrate, re-size, and sterilize industrial aggregates at superior efficiency rates, and without generating polluting air emissions.
