Yellow Wood Partners Announces Successful Completion of Oversubscribed Fund II With $370 Million of Capital Commitments

Fund II Continues Focus on Branded Consumer Products Companies




Jul 27, 2017, 7:59am EDT














BOSTON, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Yellow Wood Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on investing in consumer brands and companies, today announced that it has completed fund raising for its oversubscribed Yellow Wood Capital Partners II LP, with $370 million of committed capital.
Yellow Wood Fund II will pursue the same investment strategy it has employed since inception, partnering with management teams in North America and applying its operational and financial resources to transform brands and companies into category leaders.  Yellow Wood seeks to invest the new fund in a limited number of platforms, probably no more than five, in the consumer sector. This focused investment strategy allows the firm to concentrate its resources in working with management teams to build out their companies through operating initiatives as well as acquiring additional brands to grow and diversify their product offerings.  Industry categories targeted for investment span the consumer sector and may include Beauty & Personal Care, Health & Wellness, Household, Food & Beverage, and Pet Care among others.  Targeted equity investment for each portfolio company will be between $50-$150+ million.
Dana Schmaltz, Founding Partner of Yellow Wood Partners, said, "The successful completion of Fund II is an important milestone for Yellow Wood.  It is our belief that overachieving our targeted fund raise supports the strategy we set out to implement six years ago, to build a firm that invests and manages brands as operators who have built, and not just invested behind, consumer brands.  Our small group of sophisticated limited partners are true partners in this strategy as we have sought to form a stronger alignment of our interests. We appreciate their support and commitment to Yellow Wood and we look forward to working with them to achieve our mutual goals.  As our success with PDC Brands shows we believe there is a great opportunity to build a limited number of great portfolio companies where our team can enhance the success of consumer brands to drive exceptional returns for our investors."   
Tad Yanagi, Partner at Yellow Wood added, "We start Fund II with a strong pipeline of investment opportunities. Over the last five years we have continued to expand our outreach to entrepreneurs as well as to the financial community that understands how Yellow Wood can bring our combined operating and investment experience to acquire and grow consumer brands.  We look forward to working with skilled management teams to drive the transformation of new businesses into growing global consumer products companies that appeal to consumers across all distribution channels."  
Yellow Wood recently completed the $1.425 billion sale of PDC Brands, a rapidly growing provider of beauty, personal care, and wellness brands, after quadrupling the company's revenue and growing EBITDA by over five times. During Yellow Wood's ownership, PDC completed five exclusive acquisitions adding nine additional growing brands to the platform. 
Fund II includes a small group of eight sophisticated institutions, including a number of large university endowments, foundations and institutional investors, a number of which are returning Limited Partners of the firm. Park Hill assisted the firm as Placement Agent for certain of the limited partnership interests. Proskauer Rose LLP served as legal counsel. 
About Yellow Wood PartnersYellow Wood Partners is a Boston-based private investment firm that invests exclusively in the consumer industry in the middle market.  The firm seeks to acquire branded consumer products across a variety of channels including mass, drug, food, specialty, club and e-commerce. Yellow Wood's success in driving growth and operational efficiencies is based on the team's combination of investment expertise and complementary marketing, sales, finance, operations, and international skills. The goal of this operational approach is to form strong partnerships with the management teams of portfolio companies to drive exceptional returns for all of its stakeholders.  For more information, please visit www.yellowwoodpartners.com.

Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Greenwich, Conn., has closed $360 million for its second fund. Champlain Advisors served as lead placement agent.
PRESS RELEASE
GREENWICH, CT (January 27, 2014) — Capital Partners, Inc. (“Capital Partners”), announced today that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP (“CP II”) with total committed capital of $360 million. CP II will be led by its three Managing Directors, Mark D. Allsteadt, Brian D. Fitzgerald, and Robert S. Tucker.
According to Robert Tucker of Capital Partners, “CP II will continue Capital Partners’ primary strategy of making investments in private North American companies that have dedicated management teams, solid market positions, demonstrated records of free cash-flow generation, prospects for growth and EBITDA between $4 million and $25 million.”
Mark Allsteadt of Capital Partners, commented that “CP II will focus on opportunities that will generate an attractive annual cash yield for investors and where it can leverage the experience of our management group to actively support the portfolio companies in developing and executing their strategic plans to grow the businesses and generate long-term gains.”
“CP II plans to finance its acquisitions with a moderate level of outside debt and substantial equity which results in lower leverage-related risk for portfolio companies,” added Brian Fitzgerald of Capital Partners. “CP II has already made two platform investments: American Leather, a manufacturer of high-end, custom upholstered furniture, and Derby Fabricating Solutions, a manufacturer of foam and rubber components.”
“CP II is more than double the size of Capital Partners’ prior fund, diversifying the investor base considerably,” added Terry Crikelair, Managing Partner of Champlain Advisors, LLC who led the CP II fund placement. “The fund was oversubscribed and increased its hard cap to accommodate investor demand.”
Champlain Advisors, a global fund placement and investor relations advisory firm served as lead placement agent. Finn Dixon & Herling LLP acted as legal counsel.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
4. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
5. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

People and process

Firms
Wellington Management Company LLP
Product management
Vanguard Capital Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation in a relatively concentrated portfolio of undervalued stocks across the capitalization spectrum. Using an opportunistic approach, the fund’s advisor, Wellington Management Company LLP, invests in out-of-favor stocks that offer longer-term earnings growth projections comparable to those of the market averages. Wellington Management relies on the depth and experience of its industry analysts to uncover stocks that are undervalued relative to their potential earnings prospects, asset values, or dividends.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.Asset concentration risk: The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks. The fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
