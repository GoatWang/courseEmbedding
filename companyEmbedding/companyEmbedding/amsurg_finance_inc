Since our entrepreneurial beginnings, AMSURG has played a vital, pioneering role in the establishment of the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) industry and continues to innovate for the future. Today, AMSURG is not only among the largest surgery center management companies, but is also expanding our collaborative approach to hospital physician services and transportation through the acquisition of Sheridan Healthcare and merger with Envision Healthcare.
With more than 2,000 physician partners at 245+ ambulatory surgery center locations across the United States, AMSURG is the nationally recognized leader in the strategic and operational management of surgery centers, which include endoscopy, ophthalmology and orthopaedics. Strong partnerships, built on trust, communication and collaboration, have been the foundation of our company’s success and are essential to our future.
AMSURG surgery centers are the venue for high quality, high value, same-day surgical service with a superior patient experience. As a leader in the ambulatory surgery center quality movement, AMSURG provides a unique approach to combining technology, data analytics, patient engagement and quality reporting that results in optimal outcomes for patients. As a result, we provide health care value, improve patient experience and save lives.
AMSURG strengthens the overall quality of health care delivery by providing superior and comprehensive resources to optimize each surgery center, freeing our physician partners to focus on patient care and supporting the pursuit of their professional and personal goals.
“Never before in the history of AMSURG has our mission of helping physician partners improve, adapt and grow been more relevant than it is today with everyone in health care being impacted by health care reform,” said Chris Holden, AMSURG president and chief executive officer and director.
AMSURG and Sheridan creates a new powerhouse in health care that combines a strong national presence, leading market positions in multiple service lines and extensive local market expertise.

11/16/2016 | News release | Distributed by Public on 12/02/2016 03:23
Envision and AMSURG Announce Pricing of $550 Million Senior Notes Offering by New Amethyst Corp.








Greenwood Village, Colorado & Nashville, Tennessee (November 16, 2016) - In connection with the proposed merger of Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EVHC, 'Envision') and AMSURG Corp. (NASDAQ: AMSG, 'AMSURG') (the 'Merger'), Envision and AMSURG today announced that New Amethyst Corp., to be renamed Envision Healthcare Corporation (the 'Company'), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMSURG that will survive the Merger, has priced the private offering of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 'Notes'). The offering is expected to close on December 1, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. If the closing of the Notes occurs prior to the date of the completion of the Merger, the proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be deposited into an escrow account pending the consummation of the Merger.
      

        The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings of $3.495 billion expected to be made under a new term loan facility to be entered into by Envision Healthcare Corporation ('EHC'), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Envision, (i) to repay EHC's existing indebtedness under its term loan and asset-based facilities, (ii) to purchase or redeem AMSURG's 5.625% senior notes due 2020, (iii) to repay AMSURG's existing indebtedness under its term loan and revolving loan facilities, (iv) to pay transaction fees and expenses and (v) for working capital. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company will assume the obligations of EHC under the new term loan facility, and the Notes will be guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries that will guarantee the new term loan facility.
      

        This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes (and the guarantees) or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Notes (or any guarantees) or any other securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. The Notes (and the guarantees) will be offered and sold in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 'Securities Act') and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  None of the Notes and such guarantees have been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction, and the Notes (and such guarantees) may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable state or other jurisdiction. There can be no assurance that the proposed offering of Notes will be completed. This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c promulgated under the Securities Act.
      

Forward-Looking Statements
        This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to the offering of the Notes and the related refinancing transactions, and the completion of the Merger, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as 'may,' 'will,' 'should,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' or 'predicts,' or the negative of these words or phrases or similar words or phrases, which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. While forward-looking statements reflect Envision's and AMSURG's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance. Furthermore, Envision and AMSURG disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, of new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. These forward-looking statements are based on a variety of assumptions that may not be realized and that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties as well as risks and uncertainties referenced from time to time in Envision's and AMSURG's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

AMSURG's Physician Services Division - Sheridan - Acquires Fidere Anesthesia Consultants, Inc.






Business Wire




Oct 3, 2016 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Sheridan, the Physician Services division of AMSURG Corp. (NASDAQ: AMSG), has further expanded its anesthesiology services business and its footprint in Northern California, through the acquisition of Fidere Anesthesia Consultants, Inc. The group is comprised of 38 physicians covering seven facilities. It delivers both inpatient and outpatient anesthesia services for the El Camino Hospital System, as well as a number of ambulatory surgery centers, based in Silicon Valley. The combination provides a synergistic complement to Physician Services' previous Northern California acquisition - Medical Anesthesia Consultants.  Dr. Robert Pinsker, MD, JD, and President of Fidere Anesthesia Consultants, commented, "We were seeking a strategic partner to help meet the challenges of a changing U.S. healthcare market and strengthen the position of our physicians. After a thorough search, we selected Sheridan as the partner who would best help us to grow the unique programs we have established and position us to thrive in this challenging market. Sheridan's resources, which include robust experience in anesthesiology and multiple complementary service lines, made them the obvious partner."  Robert J. Coward, President of Physician Services, noted, "Sheridan's acquisition of Fidere Anesthesia Consultants further validates our strategy in California and strengthens our overall presence in this important market. We are proud this outstanding group of physicians is now part of our anesthesiology team; we know they will continue to deliver excellent patient care and outstanding service to client hospitals and ambulatory facilities."  About AMSURG  AMSURG's Ambulatory Services Division acquires, develops and operates ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) in partnership with physicians throughout the U.S. AMSURG's Physician Services Division, Sheridan (which includes its affiliates), provides outsourced physician services in multiple specialties to hospitals, ASCs and other healthcare facilities throughout the U.S., primarily in the areas of anesthesiology, radiology, children's services and emergency medicine.
