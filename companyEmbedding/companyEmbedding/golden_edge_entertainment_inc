Golden Edge Entertainment: Why It's Going To Zero - Luminar Media Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS:LRGR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Golden Edge Entertainment: Why It's Going To ZeroAug.11.15 | About: Luminar Media (LRGR) Penny Stock Realist Short onlyPenny Stock RealistSummaryThis stock is being promoted by only one Elite Penny Stock Group website.This will end badly like all the past promotions done by this group.Total of 4,600,000 warrants to acquire common shares (at $0.05).Golden Edge Entertainment (OTCPK:GDEE) is a name that I believe is currently the target of a penny stock promotion scheme. It is my view that the stock's intrinsic value is somewhere near $0, and it is with conviction that I recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stake immediately. I believe that Golden Edge Entertainment is a stock definitely worth shorting. My track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent.
Little Revenue, Debts, No Business. Bright Future?
As is usually the case with these types of hyped-up scams, it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the $21M market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous. With $20,000 in total current assets and $8,533 in current liabilities in the recent quarter, it is clear the company is not going in the right direction. I find it difficult to believe that GDEE can make any moves in the right direction. It really can't, and it's my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed, but to sell stock. The recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers.
A picture of GDEE chart
You can see that trading in Golden Edge Entertainment started seeing really big volumes on August 10, 2015. This is when people received an email promotion from one of the Elite Penny Group websites. This group is currently promoting the ticker $AREN you can read my report about that on going stock promotion here. What I also find funny is this stock has not traded any volume in the longest time but Friday 30,000 shares traded. To me that looks like someone bought knowing Monday that there would be a stock promotion. That would be illegal.


Email Campaign
Mysoaringpennystocks.com is the only one from the Elite Penny Stock group to send out emails on $GDEE. I believe this is a one and done stock promotion and will not be a long term promotion. This means the insiders will be dumping hard very soon.

You can see that the mysoaringpennystocks.com website is part of the Elite Group by seeing that they were sending out $AMLH emails with the rest of the sites. Now the group is sending emails out emails on $AREN.

Disclaimer

You can see that obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for Golden Edge Entertainment . Most likely, whoever owns those 4,500,000 warrants that can be converted into common shares at .05 per share.
Why else would someone spend up to $15,000+ to increase public awareness? At these levels, those are worth millions of dollars! It is worth it to them, because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices, that can mean millions in profits! Running pump-and-dump schemes is a lucrative business, and that is why we see it way too often. My job is to alert you.

(click to enlarge)
All these promotions were done with the whole group promoting. This is the first time the group is promoting two tickers at the same time. With all the other sites currently sending out emails on $AREN its my belief that $GDEE might be a one and done promotion by their one email list. This could end up really badly for people who bought the promotion Monday.

My Recommendation
If you own shares of this company, get out now. Do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool. These shares are worthless. I have shown you that the promotional mailers indicate that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse. If you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares, then I believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you. I believe the huge unusual action in Golden Edge Entertainment Inc. makes it at risk of an SEC halt. This will end up just like all their last picks - near $0. If you were burned on this one, I recommend learning from it.

Golden Edge Entertainment Inc., launches new subsidiary "Big Data Media"

/EIN News/ -- Miami, FL, June  22, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GOLDEN EDGE ENTERTAINMENT INC., (OTC PINK: GDEE) (the "Company"), a diversified entertainment company is pleased to provide the following updates.
Our executive management team is pleased to announce the launch of BIG DATA MEDIA, a new subsidiary to Golden Edge Entertainment Inc. that will focus on the continuous growth and popularity of Streaming Media.  Digital Media Streaming has the ability to attract and interact with hundreds of thousands of people at a fraction of the cost, compared to traditional media delivery. This new delivery system has disrupted the classic broadcasting business model. Big Data Media plans to begin broadcasting by streaming events that focus on education, entertainment and branding.  The company will implement technology through in-house development, external acquisitions, and strategic partnerships.  Big Data Media's social media integration model will be designed to drive consumer engagement and interactivity on multiple platforms. The strategy is to utilize sophisticated analytic tools to mine consumer data from mobile applications, social media and event participators. By pulling a targeted audience to the content, the company plans to maximize viewership revenue opportunities. Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) released a report that 78% of U.S. consumers subscribe to at least one Over-the-top (OTT) services, that is, services that deliver film and television content via the Internet, without the need for traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions. PwC also predicted that revenues from OTT TV streaming would grow to 10.1 billion by 2018, up from $3.3 billion last year. Consumers are also increasingly receiving content across mobile devices. According to Ooyala, tablet and Smartphone video consumption grew 35% in the past year and 170% since 2013. With the OTT usage and the growth of mobile video consumption, consumers will demand more content and a range of tools to receive, customize, and share.  GE’s new subsidiary will be focused on adapting to the ongoing changes in the creation, production and delivery of video content, while providing the tools to service the increasing demand.  Forward-Looking Statements   This news release contains forward-looking statements about our business, or financial condition and prospects, that reflect our assumptions and beliefs based on information currently available. The Company can give no assurance that the expectations indicated by such forward-looking statements will be realized. There may be other risks and circumstances that we are unable to predict. When used in this news release, words such as "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," "estimates" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although there may be certain forward-looking statements not accompanied by such expressions. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including risks discussed in the company's periodic reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website (www.sec.gov). All forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or to persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors other than as required under the securities laws. The Company does not assume a duty to update these forward-looking statements. Investors should refer to the risk factors disclosure outlined in our periodic reports filed from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

GOLDEN EDGE
ENTERTAINMENT, INC. 

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30,
2016


(Unaudited)


 

NOTE 1.
  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

 

Golden Edge
Entertainment, Inc. (“the Company” or “the
Issuer”) was organized under the name Retail Spicy Gourmet,
Inc. under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2010.
The name was changed to Golden Edge Entertainment, Inc. on February
26, 2013. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11
reorganization of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. (“SGO”).
Under SGO’s Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the
Company was incorporated to: (1) receive and hold any interest
which SGO had in the business of retail sales of imported spices;
and (2) issue shares of its common stock to SGO's general unsecured
creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholder.
The Company incorporated its 100% owned subsidiary, Big Data Media,
LLC., under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 1, 2016. On
February 1, 2013 the Company resolved to enter the music production
and distribution business. The Company intends to develop revenue
by providing professional services to recording artists. Such
services include production of recordings, management of the
manufacture of CDs and internet uploading of music files, and
management of the manufacture of promotional merchandise such as
T-shirts and caps. As of June 30, 2016 had not yet realized any
revenues from its planned operations. Activities have consisted
primarily of formation, establishing relationships with studio
owners, engineers, technicians, and manufacturers with whom the
Company can contract for services, and administrative efforts
related to registration under the 1934 Act.

 

NOTE 2.
 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of
presentation

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
as promulgated in the United States of America. The Company is a
development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Bid Data Media
LLC. The Company is still devoting substantially all of its
efforts to establishing the business and its planned principal
operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated
since inception have been considered as part of the Company's
development stage activities.

 

Estimates

 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the
use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process,
actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates.

 

Earnings per
share

 

The Company
computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The ASC 260
“Earnings Per Share” specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings (loss) per
share for entities with publicly held common stock.

 

Basic net
earnings (loss) per share amounts are computed by dividing the net
earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  Common equivalent equity instruments such as
4,600,000 warrants were not included in the loss per share
calculations because the inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
The 4,600,000 warrants were outstanding as of June 30,
2016.

 

 




  

Revenue
recognition

 

The Company
follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company
considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the
following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. Since inception, the Company has not recognized any
revenue from operations.

 

Cash and
cash equivalent

 

Cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less.

 

Derivative
Financial Instruments

 

The Company
evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments
have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are
accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the
statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial
instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and
on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative
instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each
reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or
not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be
required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. As of June 30,
2016, the Company’s only derivative financial instrument was
an embedded conversion feature associated with a convertible line
of credit due to the conversion price being a percentage of the
market price of the Company’s stock at the date of
conversion.

 

Stock based
compensation

 

The Company
records stock-based compensation in accordance with the ASC 718
“Shares-Based Compensation” FASB Accounting Standards
Classification using the fair value method. All transactions in
which goods or services are the consideration received for the
issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair
value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity
instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services
received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the
fair value of the equity instruments issued.

 

Income
taxes

 

Income taxes
are provided in accordance with the ASC 740 “Income
Tax” FASB Accounting Standards Classification. A deferred tax
asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences
between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry
forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net
change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in
the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

 

Recently
adopted accounting standards

In August 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial
Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of
Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU 2014-15,
which is effective for annual reporting periods ending after
December 15, 2016, extends the responsibility for performing the
going-concern assessment to management and contains guidance on how
to perform a going-concern assessment and when going-concern
disclosures would be required under U.S. GAAP. The Company elected
to adopt ASU 2014-15 effective with this financial statement.
Management’s evaluations regarding the events and conditions
that raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern have been disclosed in  Note 3-
Going Concern.

 




  

In April 2015,
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, (Subtopic
835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs.  ASU No. 2015-03 provides guidance that will
require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU No. 2015-03 affects
disclosures related to debt issuance costs but does not affect
existing recognition and measurement guidance for these
items.  ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for annual periods,
and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015.  The adoption of this guidance is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results
of operations, financial position or disclosures.

 

Recently
issued accounting standards

 

ASU 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which provides
guidance for revenue recognition for contracts. This guidance
requires an entity to review contracts in five steps and will
result in enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue arising from contracts with customers.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this new
guidance will have on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

 

ASU No.
2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes, was issued to simplify the classification of
deferred taxes on the balance sheet. The new guidance would require
that deferred taxes be classified as non-current assets and
liabilities based on the taxpaying jurisdiction. Application of the
standard, which can be applied prospectively or retrospectively, is
required for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2016
and for interim periods within that year. The adoption of the
amended guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued
a new standard which requires lessees to recognize almost all
leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability.  The new guidance will require the asset and
liability to be initially measured at the present value of the
lease payments in the statement of financial position.  The
new guidance will also require the company to recognize interest
expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization of
the right-use-asset for finance leases and recognize a single lease
cost allocated on a straight-line basis over the lease term for
operating leases, in the statement of comprehensive income.
 The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years with early application permitted.  The Company is
currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may
have on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

 

 

NOTE 3.
GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company’s operations are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties including, among others, current and potential
competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant
customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future
profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results. In
accordance with ASU 2014-15, management has evaluated the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management
has determined that there is substantial doubt that the company
will continue as a going concern due to the
Company's accumulated deficit of $243,915 as of June 30, 2016
($167,173 - December 31, 2015). The Company’s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to
generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its
obligations and/or obtain additional financing, as may be
required.

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern;
however, the above condition raises substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to do so. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The officers
and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs
of the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




  

NOTE 4.
CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE

 

The Company
received on July 27, 2015, a total of $10,000 by issuance of one
convertible note for $10,000. The convertible note is to pay to the
order of the holder the sum of the promissory note at the time and
in the manner provided. This convertible promissory note bear
interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum.
This note is payable one year from the date of issuance. It is
convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.40 per share.
Commencing on the demand date, all principal and accrued interest
shall be payable by the Company upon demand by the
investor.

 

On September 9,
2015, the Company issued a convertible line of credit to an
investor that provides for a maximum borrowing of $50,000.  As
of June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $46,250 under this
convertible line of credit. The convertible line of credit (i) is
unsecured, (ii) bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum, and
(iii) is due on September 9, 2016.  The outstanding balance of
under this convertible line of credit is convertible at any time at
the option of the investor into shares of the Company’s
common stock that is determined by dividing the amount to be
converted by 60% of the bid price on the day of conversion.
 

 

Due to the
variable conversion price associated with this convertible line of
credit, the Company has determined that the conversion feature is
considered derivative liabilities.  Accordingly, the Company
recorded a change in fair value of the derivative liability in the
amount of $10,610 and $11,632 for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively.  There was no such transaction
during the three and six month periods ended June 30,
2015.

 

The Company
recognized financing costs of $7,267 and $7,533 during the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, and $24,324 and $27,937 for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the
amortization of the debt discount.

 

The Company
received on January 8, 2016, a total of $20,000 by issuance of one
convertible note for $20,000. The convertible note is to pay to the
order of the holder the sum of the promissory note at the time and
in the manner provided. This convertible promissory note bear
interest from the date of issuance at the rate of 8% per annum.
This note is payable one year from the date of issuance. It is
convertible any time at a fixed price of $0.20 per share.
Commencing on the demand date, all principal and accrued interest
shall be payable by the Company upon demand by the
investor.

 

 

NOTE 5.
DERIVATIVE LIABILITY

 

The convertible
line of credit discussed in Note 4 has a variable conversion price
which results in the conversion feature being recorded as a
derivative liability.

 

The fair value
of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under
current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
liability is recorded in the statement of operations under other
income (expense).

 

The Company
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the
following assumptions to measure the fair value of derivative
liability at June 30, 2016.

NOTE 6.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY COMMON STOCK

 

The authorized
share capital of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of
common stock with $0.0001 par value, and 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock also with $0.0001 par value. No other classes of

The
Company’s first issuance of common stock, totaling 1,180,000
shares, took place on December 30, 2010 pursuant to the Chapter 11
Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
the matter of Spicy Gourmet Organics, Inc. (“SGO”). The
Court ordered the distribution of shares in Retail Spicy Gourmet,
Inc. to all general unsecured creditors of SGO, with these
creditors to receive their pro rata share (according to
amount of debt held) of a pool of 80,000 shares in the Company. The
Court also ordered the distribution of 100,000 shares in the
Company to the shareholders of SGO. The Court also ordered the
distribution of 1,000,000 shares and 5,000,000 warrants in the
Company to the administrative creditors of SGO, with these
creditors to receive one share of common stock and five warrants in
the Company for each $0.05 of SGO’s administrative debt which
they held. The warrants consisted of 1,000,000 “A
Warrants” each convertible into one share of common stock at
an exercise price of $3.00; 1,000,000 “B Warrants” each
convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of

for 400,000 shares.

 

As a result of
these issuances, there were a total 17,600,000 common shares issued
and outstanding, and a total of 4,600,000 warrants to acquire
