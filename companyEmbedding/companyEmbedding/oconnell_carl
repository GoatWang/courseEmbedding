– USA, MT – Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:XTNT), a leader in the development of regenerative medicine products and medical devices, today announced the appointment of Carl O’Connell as the permanent CEO, effective February 17th, 2017. Mr. O’Connell previously served as president of Xtant since October of 2016 and was appointed as interim CEO on January 21st, 2017.
Prior to joining Xtant Medical, Mr. O’Connell most recently served as the Vice President Global Marketing – Extremities for Wright Medical, a recognized leader in the global foot and ankle market. Mr. O’Connell lead marketing teams and initiatives that were instrumental in achieving US growth initiatives that exceeded 28%, and 23% globally. He also lead the completion of marketing integration of 3 acquired businesses within a year, recruited top talent to his team, and supported the launch of multiple product line extensions and new products, including the successful launch of the market leading Infinity Total Ankle. During his tenure as Global Vice President Marketing for Stryker Spine, Mr. O’Connell drove marketing leadership and brand differentiation programs to support a 20% growth imperative, which was achieved through strategic cross divisional collaboration and the successful launches of line extensions and product upgrades. Mr. O’Connell served as the President and CEO of MedSurg – ITOCHU International, a division of ITOCHU Corporation, the 3rd largest Japanese trading corporation with over $70B in sales transactions, where he was responsible for the reorganization of three recently impaired acquisitions by supporting success attributes, acquiring new vendor contracts, stabilizing and growing top line sales at double digit growth rates, and driving the division to profitability.
“We are proud to announce Carl O’Connell has been promoted to the position of CEO” said Kent Swanson, Chairman of Xtant Medical’s Board of Directors. “With his extensive leadership in the medical device industry and commercialization expertise, we are confident that he is the right choice to lead Xtant to new levels of growth and profitability. Since joining the organization as President in 2016, he has made significant contributions to the record performance of the Company in Q4 2016 and we share his enthusiasm for the outlook of the Company.”
“I am excited to lead what I feel has the potential to be a world-class organization and a considerable competitor in the market” said Carl O’Connell, now CEO of Xtant Medical. “Since joining the organization, I have had a chance to assess the talented Xtant Medical team, the quality of our products, the commitment to our customers, the respect for the gift of donation, and the opportunity that lies ahead. I look forward to continuing to work with this team, expanding upon our recent successes and continuing to establish the strategic course to take Xtant Medical to the next level. I am appreciative of the confidence bestowed in me by the executive management team, the board of directors, and our stakeholders.”
Carl O’Connell has over 30 years of experience in the healthcare and medical device arena. In addition to the positions held above, Mr. O’Connell also served as a Principal at Hudson Healthcare Partners, and President for Carl Zeiss Surgical, Inc. Mr. O’Connell’s responsibilities have spanned from global marketing, sales, manufacturing, leadership development, regulatory affairs, corporate quality systems, research, product and business development functions. Carl received a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and an M.B.A. from Mount St. Mary’s College, Maryland. Through the span of his career, Mr. O’Connell has launched more than 100 products and participated in numerous M&A events.

                                    Hello Everyone.
I have been away for awhile,due to illness. I am back and ready to get back to work. Living in Calgary,Alberta, and at this point in time we are in a state of emergency. Calgary and Area is pretty much flooded and 100,000 people have been evacuated. So far I am fortunate and am high and dry. I am working from home office which is good. I am so happy that so far, there has been no loss of life. People have rallied together to help each other and many of us  who are dry are inviting the flood victims into our  private homes. Where there is no room centres have been set up and volunteers are helping out. The army is here to rescue those who cannot be reached.

                                    I cannot recall in my life, ever have knowing a set of twins. Would you believe that in the past four months I have done wedding videos for three sets of twins. Not just twins, but identical twins. And I mean identical.
Adding to that, I took another booking for a wedding video today and for the second time in a month, I am doing a wedding video where the brides name is Samantha and the grooms name is Chris.

A Little Effort Leads To A Wealth Of Success

What would you do if you no longer had to worry about money? Where would you go? How would you spend your time?

If you�re like most people, you rarely stop to think about these kinds of questions. Too busy caught up in the day-to-day rat race, you�ve forgotten the dreams you had for yourself and your loved ones . . . or at least put them on the back burner for �later.�

Meanwhile, your life is passing you by. Birthdays come and go. Days blend into weeks and months, with only the occasional vacation or major life change to mix things up.

You know there must be more to life, but you�re not sure where to even begin making a change.

Here�s a thought for you: what if you could work from home? http://www.lifestylebusinessonline.com

                                    Hi everyone. I have just joined whoswho so would like to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I am from Brisbane, Australia.I am a videographer specialising in weddings. I will of course take on any other event that a client wants videoed.
Filming and photography has been a hobby since as far back as 1968, but it has only been in the last 12 months that I have taken it up as a full time job. This was due to restructering at my last job that made my position surplus. Having worked in the electrical and electronics fields all my life, I thought that this was all I could do, then suddenly I realised - hey, i have a lifetime hobby that i enjoy and have learnt so much about - step outside the square you've been boxed up in all those years and do something different. If you wish to have a look at my website you will find it at www.alloccasionsvideos.com.au
