      --$24,712,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,120,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX 
      certificates, and class PEX certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      Since Fitch issued its expected ratings on Oct. 20, 2015, the 
      $366,122,000 class A-4FL and $0 class A-FX certificates have been 
      removed from the capital structure by the issuer. Fitch has withdrawn 
      its ratings on the class A-4FL and A-4FX certificates. Fitch does not 
      rate the $46,953,380 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 102 loans secured by 118 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $988.5 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Liberty Island Group I LLC, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, Wells Fargo 
      Bank, N.A., C-III Commercial Mortgage LLC, Societe Generale and Basis 
      Real Estate Capital II, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 60.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 72.2%, and asset summary reviews on 73.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool demonstrates high leverage statistics with 
      a Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.12x and 112.9%, respectively. Excluding the 
      credit-assessed 11 Madison Avenue (3.1% of pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.11x and 114.6%, respectively.
    

      Pool Diversity: The top 10 loans represent 37.4% of the pool by balance. 
      This is well below the year-to-date 2015 average of 48.5% and the 2014 
      average of 50.5%. The pool LCI was 229, which is below both the 
      year-to-date 2015 and 2014 averages of 354 and 387, respectively. There 
      was no significant sponsor concentration, with an SCI score of 237. The 
      year-to-date 2015 and 2014 SCI averages were 391 and 419, respectively.
    

      Credit Opinion Loan: One loan, 11 Madison Avenue (3.1% of the pool), has 
      an investment-grade credit opinion of 'A-' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Excluding the 11 Madison Avenue loan, Fitch's implied conduit 
      subordination at the junior 'AAAsf' tranche is approximately 25.8% and 
      'BBB-sf' is approximately 8.6%
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 13.7% below the most recent year's 
      NOI (for properties for which a full year NOI was provided, excluding 
      properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated 
      further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults 
      and loss severities on defaulted loans and could result in potential 
      rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivities of the ratings assigned to WFCM 
      2015-C31 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      102 mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the 
      ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

John McCain, R-Ariz., shocked his conservative colleagues early Friday morning by defying President Trump to cast the decisive vote against the Republican Party’s bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. With Democrats firmly opposed, the GOP could afford only two Republican defections to gut Obamacare. When McCain, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, walked onto the Senate floor about 1:30 a.m. and voted “no” with a thumbs-down, the shock was palpable.Watch the Moment John McCain Voted Against the Obamacare 'Skinny Repeal'TimeAfter Senate rejects 'skinny repeal' bill: Hollywood and DC have a lot to say on TwitterSan Francisco Chronicle8,134Reactions.
