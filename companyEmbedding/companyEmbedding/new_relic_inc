Contact us.Datadog takes care of the complex task of managing a metrics back-end. Instead of figuring out how and where to store data, we get to focus on actually using the data to make better decisions.Arup Chakrabarti, Head of Operations Engineering, Pagerduty Datadog has made it possible for us to find and fix problems quickly.Dario Simonassi, Architecture Manager, Mercado Libre With Datadog we can trace a problem back to its root cause—all the way back to a single database call.Kiril Savino, CTO, GameChanger Common QuestionsHow do you define a host?A host is any physical or virtual OS instance that you monitor with Datadog.How do I monitor containers?The Datadog Agent runs in a container alongside any number of other containers on a host. From there it can collect metrics from its neighboring containers and from the host itself. Depending on your plan, you can monitor 10 or 20 containers free for each host license.Additional containers will be billed at $0.002 per container per hour. In addition, you can purchase prepaid containers at $1 per container per month.What is a custom metric?Datadog was designed to allow you to monitor your own custom applications and business metrics—not just your infrastructure. You can send any and all of your organization's important metrics to Datadog for graphing, alerting, correlation, anomaly detection and more. Example uses: monitoring ad revenue, the rate at which shopping carts are abandoned, or the health of an in-game economy. Many customers find these metrics invaluable, especially when combined with infrastructure metrics.How can I send custom metrics and events?You can send Datadog custom metrics in three ways:1) The Datadog Agent ships with DogStatsD so you can submit custom metrics via the Agent’s non-blocking API functions for many programming languages. 2) The Datadog Agent allows for the creation of custom integrations via plugins to the agent. This plugin system allows the agent to collect custom metrics on your behalf. Integrations which are contributed back to Datadog Agent convert to standard metrics.3) Datadog also has a full-featured API that you can send your metrics to—either directly over HTTP or with a language-specific library.How can I be sure my data is secure?Security is our top priority. This includes, universal HTTPS, strong TLS configuration, and HTTP Strict Transport Security. Our agent is open-source, which means it can be reviewed to ensure it meets your security requirements.Are there other billing options?Annual, monthly and hourly plans are available. We can customize billing plans to meet your needs. For a detailed explanation of billing, please see our Billing FAQ.Do you have special offerings for partners?We’re always looking to partner with technology and service providers and resellers. See our Partners page for more.Still Have Questions?ASK OUR EXPERTSThanks, we'll be in touch soon.×Get Started with DatadogDatadog APMFull visibility into your apps’ code performanceDetermine whether issues originate in the app or infrastructure with request tracing that finds slow queries, bugs, or inefficient code.GET STARTED FREEGET STARTED FREE Supported Languages PRODUCT FEATURESTracing to visualize your apps’ performanceTrack time spent by your Go, Python, and Ruby apps processing single operationsIdentify bottlenecks in your apps with full latency breakdownsDrill down into flame graphs for request-level details Overview of application servicesDrill into each of your apps & services to see number of hits, error rates, and distribution of latencyVisualize your services aggregated by typeAnalyze all of the endpoints for your servicesMulti-faceted alertingAlert on uptime, thresholds, automatically detected outliers, anomalies, and moreCollaborate using Slack, PagerDuty, and other toolsAlert on subsets of your data or exclude certain hostsVisibility into your apps, infrastructure, and other servicesDetermine whether issues originate in your apps or infrastructureInstrument, analyze, and alert on custom metrics in your apps with StatsDGain visibility into external servicesLOVED & TRUSTED BY THOUSANDSGET FREE UNLIMITED MONITORING FOR 14 DAYS×Get Started with Datadog

Jobs at New Relic















            This is what we stand for
          

            We have five core values at New Relic. From top to bottom, these values represent who we are and how we work.
          










            Bold
          

            We take risks to deliver ground-breaking innovation. We are courageous.
          








            Authentic
          

            We are genuine, honest, and inclusive. We can be ourselves at work.
          








            Accountable
          

            We take pride in what we do and hold ourselves to high standards. We deliver on our commitments.
          








            Passionate
          

            We are inspired by, and seek to inspire, our customers. We strive to make a difference.
          








            Connected
          

            We build trusted, personal connections with each other. We are a team.
          










          We want to create an environment where people can feel like they’re being their true selves and they’re respected and admired, and supported and loved for who they are. Therefore, they’re more comfortable being their authentic selves. The best people we’ve hired have all been comfortable with who they are.
          Tone at the Top – Lew Cirne, CEO New Relic talks authenticity and joy

Diversity and Inclusion at New Relic
Our differences are a source of our strength.
At New Relic, our many identities, perspectives, backgrounds, and beliefs are all celebrated. Freely expressed differences are valued, and all employees have the support they need to take risks, learn, and develop their careers. Every day, we demand and uphold respect for others while working together to unlock a new era of innovation.










            We are all data nerds
          

            We're mavericks, risk-takers, problem solvers, punks, parents, athletes, activists, pancakes, geeks, and artists. Wait, pancakes? Mmm... pancakes.  Here's just a few members of our ever-growing New Relic family.

Response Time, Throughput, and Error Rates
Response time is an average of the total time spent across all web transactions occurring within a selected time frame on the server-side. Throughput is requests per minute through the application. Error rates measures the percentage of errors over a set time period for your application.






Database Monitoring: Metrics and SQL Analysis
Database metrics drill into an individual database call with specific details like response time and throughput, time consumption by caller, and slow SQL traces, all specific to that individual call (including stack traces from wherever the query was invoked). SQL query analysis allows you to track the exact SQL statements that are slowing down your site.






Filterable Error Analytics and Traces
Detailed info on what line of code caused an error and the call hierarchy, including filterable error traces, grouped by transaction name, and error class. You can also sort and drill into more detailed error information for a selected trace, including stack traces, default attributes and custom attributes from New Relic Insights that relate to the specific occurrence of the error.






Transaction Metrics and Traces
Metrics and data on the tiniest transaction detail levels—from your slowest individual HTTP requests to the SQL statement.






Service Maps
Provides a real-time visualization of your application and microservices architecture topology showing connections, dependencies, and real-time health status.






Deployment Tracking
Track and mark deployments to your applications, capture a before-and-after snapshot of your app's performance, and understand the impact of an intended change.






SLA Reports
Daily, weekly, or monthly SLA reports showing graphical trends over selected time periods to help you better understand and analyze where application performance is heading.

Do Docker container instances count as hosts?
          No, Docker container instances do not count as hosts for licensing purposes. We license by the number of hosts—physical servers and/or virtual machines—on which those containers run.










Monthly pricing for common host providers
Pricing is shown at the reduced annual rate.
        Monthly costs without an annual contract are 3x higher.

Jobs at New Relic















            This is what we stand for
          

            We have five core values at New Relic. From top to bottom, these values represent who we are and how we work.
          










            Bold
          

            We take risks to deliver ground-breaking innovation. We are courageous.
          








            Authentic
          

            We are genuine, honest, and inclusive. We can be ourselves at work.
          








            Accountable
          

            We take pride in what we do and hold ourselves to high standards. We deliver on our commitments.
          








            Passionate
          

            We are inspired by, and seek to inspire, our customers. We strive to make a difference.
          








            Connected
          

            We build trusted, personal connections with each other. We are a team.
          










          We want to create an environment where people can feel like they’re being their true selves and they’re respected and admired, and supported and loved for who they are. Therefore, they’re more comfortable being their authentic selves. The best people we’ve hired have all been comfortable with who they are.
          Tone at the Top – Lew Cirne, CEO New Relic talks authenticity and joy
Read the article









Diversity and Inclusion at New Relic
Our differences are a source of our strength.
At New Relic, our many identities, perspectives, backgrounds, and beliefs are all celebrated. Freely expressed differences are valued, and all employees have the support they need to take risks, learn, and develop their careers. Every day, we demand and uphold respect for others while working together to unlock a new era of innovation.










            We are all data nerds
          

            We're mavericks, risk-takers, problem solvers, punks, parents, athletes, activists, pancakes, geeks, and artists. Wait, pancakes? Mmm... pancakes.  Here's just a few members of our ever-growing New Relic family.

Response Time, Throughput, and Error Rates
Response time is an average of the total time spent across all web transactions occurring within a selected time frame on the server-side. Throughput is requests per minute through the application. Error rates measures the percentage of errors over a set time period for your application.






Database Monitoring: Metrics and SQL Analysis
Database metrics drill into an individual database call with specific details like response time and throughput, time consumption by caller, and slow SQL traces, all specific to that individual call (including stack traces from wherever the query was invoked). SQL query analysis allows you to track the exact SQL statements that are slowing down your site.






Filterable Error Analytics and Traces
Detailed info on what line of code caused an error and the call hierarchy, including filterable error traces, grouped by transaction name, and error class. You can also sort and drill into more detailed error information for a selected trace, including stack traces, default attributes and custom attributes from New Relic Insights that relate to the specific occurrence of the error.






Transaction Metrics and Traces
Metrics and data on the tiniest transaction detail levels—from your slowest individual HTTP requests to the SQL statement.






Service Maps
Provides a real-time visualization of your application and microservices architecture topology showing connections, dependencies, and real-time health status.






Deployment Tracking
Track and mark deployments to your applications, capture a before-and-after snapshot of your app's performance, and understand the impact of an intended change.






SLA Reports
Daily, weekly, or monthly SLA reports showing graphical trends over selected time periods to help you better understand and analyze where application performance is heading.

Do Docker container instances count as hosts?
          No, Docker container instances do not count as hosts for licensing purposes. We license by the number of hosts—physical servers and/or virtual machines—on which those containers run.










Monthly pricing for common host providers
Pricing is shown at the reduced annual rate.
        Monthly costs without an annual contract are 3x higher.

					Full Description



New Relic, Inc. (New Relic), incorporated on October 5, 2007, is a provider of enterprise software. The Company's cloud-based platform and range of products (known as New Relic Software Analytics Cloud) enable organizations to collect, store and analyze software data in real time. The Company's New Relic Software Analytics Cloud consists of an integrated suite of products, a data database and an open platform. Its products for technology users focus on software performance management and monitoring. New Relic offers an integrated suite of products, which include New Relic APM for application performance management; New Relic Mobile for mobile application performance management; New Relic Servers for server monitoring for cloud and data centers; New Relic Browser for end user experience monitoring and performance monitoring; New Relic Synthetics for software testing through simulated usage; New Relic Plugins, which are plugins to extend its functionality into other applications; New Relic Alerts for policy management and delivering alerts across entire suite of products, and New Relic Insights for real-time big data analytics for business managers.The Company's products are based on a cloud architecture and a software as a service (SaaS) delivery model. New Relic's SaaS solution can manage hybrid cloud and heterogeneous architectures, including on-premise software. Its products support a range of software development languages and frameworks, such as Java and .NET, Ruby, hypertext preprocessor (PHP), Python and Node.js, as well as mobile operating systems, including iPhone operating system (iOS) and Android. The Company provides application program interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) for customers, partners and developers to build applications, which integrate with and embed its product functionality into other applications. The Company has developed a library of purpose-built software agents that supports a range of programming languages, mobile platforms and operating systems. Its agent software code is deployed onto application servers, browsers, mobile devices and operating systems. The Company's cloud-based, big data database can store and prepare amounts of data for analysis and querying. Its New Relic Insights application, which utilizes a flexible and schema-less database architecture for unstructured data, allows storage of new data types, including data collected by agents and through its APIs.New Relic APMNew Relic APM provides visibility into the performance and usage of server-based applications, such as data pertaining to response time, transaction throughput, error rates, transactions and user satisfaction. New Relic APM provides a range of features, including transaction tracing, X-ray sessions, cross application tracing, thread profiling, database diagnostics and slow structured query language (SQL) traces. New Relic APM provides reporting and alerting functionality through standard configurations, as well as customer-defined policy configurations. The alerts include application performance degradation, falling traffic and declining user satisfaction metrics. Alerts can be delivered through a range of channels, including e-mail, text messages, push notifications and social channels, and can be integrated with bug tracking systems and group chat applications. New Relic APM's transactions feature enables business users to collect and analyze data generated by business transactions separately from data about application performance.New Relic MobileNew Relic Mobile provides code-level visibility into the performance and health of mobile applications running on the iOS and Android mobile operating systems. New Relic Mobile provides code-level diagnostics for native application code running on the mobile device and enables performance, throughput, crash reporting and error analysis for the interactions between the mobile application and the supporting backend services. New Relic Mobile provides detail on usage of mobile device resources, including central processing unit (CPU), memory and network bandwidth from actual user devices. The User Interactions feature provides breakdowns of time spent in the code running on the device, including view loading, method calls and data store activity.New Relic ServersNew Relic Servers provides visibility into server and operating system performance for physical and virtual servers, including servers that are deployed on-premise or in the cloud, by analyzing key metrics, which include CPU usage, physical memory, network activity, and disk input/output utilization and capacity. New Relic Servers provides end-to-end visibility into how server resources and utilization levels impact the applications being run. By presenting server performance with application performance in a shared user interface, New Relic Servers enables various departments to collaborate in identifying and addressing underlying performance issues.New Relic BrowserNew Relic Browser monitors the page view experiences of actual end users for desktop and mobile browser-based applications, and provides code-level diagnostics for JavaScript code running directly in the browser. New Relic Browser monitors the page load time for user interactions, providing data on how time is spent during each page load, including network time, request queuing, document object model processing and page rendering. New Relic Browser can automatically identify, track and analyze the geographic location of each page view to provide performance analytics by geography, including response time, user satisfaction, application adoption and usage trends.New Relic SyntheticsNew Relic Synthetics simulates usage and reproduces functionality that enables its users to test their software across the entire development life cycle. New Relic Synthetics uses open standards, including the open source scripting language Selenium. New Relic Synthetics is integrated into the Company's product suite, including New Relic APM, New Relic Browser and New Relic Insights. It lets the users select what region they want their test scripts to run from. Users can also run test scripts on their own systems.New Relic PluginsNew Relic Plugins provides customers, partners and third-party developers with APIs and SDKs to build plugins that extend its functionality and data into various applications or information technology (IT) environment. The New Relic Plugin Central marketplace offers a range of downloadable plugins to users. It offers a click and drag dashboard creation tool that allows users to customize their user experience. Plugins are built to monitor IT architecture elements, including databases, networks, queuing systems, and communication tools, enabling customers to monitor their entire application stack.New Relic AlertsNew Relic Alerts is a centralized notification system that delivers alerts from across the products in the New Relic Software Analytics Cloud. It allows users to manage alert policies and alert conditions, so that they receive early notification to identify potential performance issues and take action. New Relic Alerts is designed to integrate with communication and collaboration applications. New Relic Alerts provides a dedicated user interface for alert configuration and incident management across New Relic products.New Relic InsightsNew Relic Insights enables technology and business users to perform real-time analysis. New Relic Insights is built on an event database that runs in a cloud-hosted, distributed super-cluster. The Company has developed New Relic Query Language (NRQL) as a SQL-type query language for real-time analytics. NRQL has autocomplete capabilities that assist users by providing syntax as they type, suggesting built-in analytics functions, and can list the attributes and event types available for querying. New Relic Insights produces data visualizations with every query, with pre-built charts and graphs. New Relic Insights also includes a feature called Data Apps that enables users to create and publish a set of customer-curated dashboards, along with an optional search field, for use by non-technical business users.The Company competes with AppDynamics, Inc., Dynatrace LLC, Splunk Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, BMC Software, Inc., CA, Inc., Compuware Corporation, Riverbed Technology, Inc., SAP SE, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Google Inc. and Webtrends Inc.

Outlook:


New Relic is initiating its outlook for its first quarter of fiscal
      2018, as well as the full fiscal year 2018, ending March 31, 2018. New
      Relic has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP loss from
      operations or non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly
      comparable GAAP measure because certain items, namely stock-based
      compensation, lawsuit litigation expenses and employer payroll taxes on
      equity incentive plans, are out of New Relic’s control and cannot be
      reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available
      without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these
      factors could be material to New Relic’s results computed in accordance
      with GAAP.
    


        First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook:

        

            Revenue between $77.0 million and $78.5 million, representing
            year-over-year growth of between 31% and 34%.
          

            Non-GAAP loss from operations of between $6.5 million and $7.5
            million.
          

            Non-GAAP net loss per share of between $0.12 and $0.14. This
            assumes 53.7 million non-GAAP weighted average common shares
            outstanding.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


New Relic discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this
      release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP
      loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP
      gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing,
      non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative,
      non-GAAP net loss per share and free cash flow. New Relic uses each of
      these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare
      operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and
      forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to
      evaluate New Relic’s financial performance. New Relic believes they are
      useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its
      operational performance, as further discussed below. New Relic’s
      non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly
      comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other
      companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results
      differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In
      addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures
      because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance
      with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by
      other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on
      New Relic’s reported financial results.
    

      Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from,
      or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance
      with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial
      measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been
      provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press
      release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these
      historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
      GAAP financial measures.
    

New Relic defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP sales and marketing,
      non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative,
      non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss as the respective GAAP
      balances, adjusted for: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2)
      amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in software
      development costs, (3) the amortization of purchased intangibles, (4)
      the transaction costs related to acquisition, (5) lawsuit litigation
      expense, and (6) employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans,
      as applicable. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated as non-GAAP net
      loss divided by weighted average shares used to compute net loss per
      share attributable to common stockholders. New Relic defines free cash
      flow as GAAP cash from operations, minus capital expenditures, minus
      capitalized software.
    

      Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to
      investors and others in assessing New Relic's operating performance due
      to the following factors:
    

Stock-based compensation and amortization of stock-based compensation
      capitalized in software development costs: New Relic utilizes
      share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is
      principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its
      stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address
      operational performance for any particular period. As a result,
      share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally
      unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular
      period.
    

Amortization of purchased intangibles and transaction costs related
      to acquisition. New Relic views amortization of purchased intangible
      assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at
      the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated
      for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased
      intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations
      during any particular period. Similarly, New Relic views acquisition
      related expenses as events that are not necessarily reflective of
      operational performance during a period.
    

Lawsuit litigation expense. New Relic may from time to time incur
      charges or benefits that are outside of the ordinary course of New
      Relic’s business related to litigation. New Relic believes it is useful
      to exclude such charges or benefits because it does not consider such
      amounts to be part of the ongoing operation of New Relic's business and
      because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the matter.
    

Employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans. New Relic
      excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans as these
      expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards
      and the price of New Relic's common stock at the time of vesting or
      exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period
      independent of the financial and operating performance of New Relic’s
      business.
    

      Additionally, New Relic's management believes that the non-GAAP
      financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to investors because
      management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking
      into consideration capital expenditures and the capitalization of
      software development costs due to the fact that these expenditures are
      considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.
    

Operating Metrics


      New Relic’s dollar-based net expansion rate compares its recurring
      subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. It is
      increased when customers increase their use of New Relic’s products, use
      additional products, or upgrade to a higher subscription tier. New
      Relic’s dollar-based net expansion rate is reduced when customers
      decrease their use of New Relic’s products, use fewer products, or
      downgrade to a lower subscription tier.
    

New Relic's monthly recurring revenue represents the revenue that New
      Relic would contractually expect to receive from those customers over
      the following month, without any increase or reduction in any of their
      subscriptions. Similarly, annual recurring revenue represents the
      revenue that New Relic would contractually expect to receive from those
      customers over the following 12-month period, without any increase or
      reduction in any of their subscriptions.
    

New Relic defines the number of paid business accounts at the end of any
      particular period as the number of accounts at the end of the period as
      identified by a unique account identifier for which New Relic has
      recognized revenue on the last day of the period indicated.

Contact us.Datadog takes care of the complex task of managing a metrics back-end. Instead of figuring out how and where to store data, we get to focus on actually using the data to make better decisions.Arup Chakrabarti, Head of Operations Engineering, Pagerduty Datadog has made it possible for us to find and fix problems quickly.Dario Simonassi, Architecture Manager, Mercado Libre With Datadog we can trace a problem back to its root cause—all the way back to a single database call.Kiril Savino, CTO, GameChanger Common QuestionsHow do you define a host?A host is any physical or virtual OS instance that you monitor with Datadog.How do I monitor containers?The Datadog Agent runs in a container alongside any number of other containers on a host. From there it can collect metrics from its neighboring containers and from the host itself. Depending on your plan, you can monitor 10 or 20 containers free for each host license.Additional containers will be billed at $0.002 per container per hour. In addition, you can purchase prepaid containers at $1 per container per month.What is a custom metric?Datadog was designed to allow you to monitor your own custom applications and business metrics—not just your infrastructure. You can send any and all of your organization's important metrics to Datadog for graphing, alerting, correlation, anomaly detection and more. Example uses: monitoring ad revenue, the rate at which shopping carts are abandoned, or the health of an in-game economy. Many customers find these metrics invaluable, especially when combined with infrastructure metrics.How can I send custom metrics and events?You can send Datadog custom metrics in three ways:1) The Datadog Agent ships with DogStatsD so you can submit custom metrics via the Agent’s non-blocking API functions for many programming languages. 2) The Datadog Agent allows for the creation of custom integrations via plugins to the agent. This plugin system allows the agent to collect custom metrics on your behalf. Integrations which are contributed back to Datadog Agent convert to standard metrics.3) Datadog also has a full-featured API that you can send your metrics to—either directly over HTTP or with a language-specific library.How can I be sure my data is secure?Security is our top priority. This includes, universal HTTPS, strong TLS configuration, and HTTP Strict Transport Security. Our agent is open-source, which means it can be reviewed to ensure it meets your security requirements.Are there other billing options?Annual, monthly and hourly plans are available. We can customize billing plans to meet your needs. For a detailed explanation of billing, please see our Billing FAQ.Do you have special offerings for partners?We’re always looking to partner with technology and service providers and resellers. See our Partners page for more.Still Have Questions?ASK OUR EXPERTSThanks, we'll be in touch soon.×Get Started with DatadogInstantly see into all your systems, apps, and servicesDatadog APM is hereMore than 200 built-in integrationsSee across all your systems, apps, and servicesALLAPIAWSAZURECACHINGCLOUDCOLLABORATIONCONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENTCONTAINERSCOST MANAGEMENTDATA STOREEXCEPTIONSGOOGLE CLOUDISSUE TRACKINGLANGUAGESLOGGINGMESSAGINGMONITORINGNETWORKNOTIFICATIONORCHESTRATIONOS & SYSTEMPROCESSINGPROVISIONINGSEARCHSECURITYSOURCE CONTROLWEBALLALLAPIAWSAZURECACHINGCLOUDCOLLABORATIONCONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENTCONTAINERSCOST MANAGEMENTDATA STOREEXCEPTIONSGOOGLE CLOUDISSUE TRACKINGLANGUAGESLOGGINGMESSAGINGMONITORINGNETWORKNOTIFICATIONORCHESTRATIONOS & SYSTEMPROCESSINGPROVISIONINGSEARCHSECURITYSOURCE CONTROLWEBActiveMQCollect metrics for brokers and queues, producers and consumers, and more.LEARN MOREAirbrakeView, search on, and discuss Airbrake exceptions in your event stream.LEARN MOREAmazon ALBCollect and monitor Application Load Balancing metrics.LEARN MOREAmazon API GatewayTrack gateway errors, cache hits and misses, and request latency.LEARN MOREAmazon Auto ScalingTrack the status and counts of instances in your Auto Scaling groups.LEARN MOREAmazon BillingMonitor actual and estimated spend on your AWS account.LEARN MOREAmazon CloudfrontTrack error rates, request counts, and bytes downloaded and uploaded.LEARN MOREAmazon CloudsearchTrack index utilization, successful request count, and more.LEARN MOREAmazon CloudTrailAlert on suspicious AWS account activity.LEARN MOREAmazon CodedeploySee deployments as they happen and track how long they take.LEARN MOREAmazon DynamodbTrack table size, read/write capacity, request latency, and more.LEARN MOREAmazon EBSTrack snapshot age, IOPS, read/write times, and more.LEARN MOREAmazon EC2Track instance resource usage, monitor status checks, and more.LEARN MOREAmazon ECSMonitor container statuses, track resource usage, and more.LEARN MOREAmazon EFSTrack key Amazon Elastic Filesystem metrics.LEARN MOREAmazon ElasticacheTrack key Amazon ElasicCache metrics.LEARN MOREAmazon ElasticbeanstalkTrack key Amazon ElasticBeanstalk metrics.LEARN MOREAmazon ELBTrack key Amazon Elastic Loadbalancer metrics.LEARN MOREAmazon EMRTrack key Amazon Elastic Map Reduce metrics.

Response Time, Throughput, and Error Rates
Response time is an average of the total time spent across all web transactions occurring within a selected time frame on the server-side. Throughput is requests per minute through the application. Error rates measures the percentage of errors over a set time period for your application.






Database Monitoring: Metrics and SQL Analysis
Database metrics drill into an individual database call with specific details like response time and throughput, time consumption by caller, and slow SQL traces, all specific to that individual call (including stack traces from wherever the query was invoked). SQL query analysis allows you to track the exact SQL statements that are slowing down your site.






Filterable Error Analytics and Traces
Detailed info on what line of code caused an error and the call hierarchy, including filterable error traces, grouped by transaction name, and error class. You can also sort and drill into more detailed error information for a selected trace, including stack traces, default attributes and custom attributes from New Relic Insights that relate to the specific occurrence of the error.






Transaction Metrics and Traces
Metrics and data on the tiniest transaction detail levels—from your slowest individual HTTP requests to the SQL statement.






Service Maps
Provides a real-time visualization of your application and microservices architecture topology showing connections, dependencies, and real-time health status.






Deployment Tracking
Track and mark deployments to your applications, capture a before-and-after snapshot of your app's performance, and understand the impact of an intended change.






SLA Reports
Daily, weekly, or monthly SLA reports showing graphical trends over selected time periods to help you better understand and analyze where application performance is heading.

Do Docker container instances count as hosts?
          No, Docker container instances do not count as hosts for licensing purposes. We license by the number of hosts—physical servers and/or virtual machines—on which those containers run.










Monthly pricing for common host providers
Pricing is shown at the reduced annual rate.
        Monthly costs without an annual contract are 3x higher.

History[edit]
Lew Cirne[1] founded New Relic in 2008 and is the company's CEO. The name "New Relic" is an anagram of founder Lew Cirne's name.[2]
In February 2013, New Relic raised $80 million from investors including Insight Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price, Benchmark Capital, Allen & Company, Trinity Ventures, Passport Capital, Dragoneer, and Tenaya Capital at a valuation of $750 million.[3][4] The funding round helped New Relic extend its software analytics platform to include Android and iOS native mobile apps.[5][3] In April 2014, New Relic raised another $100 million in funding led by BlackRock, Inc., and Passport Capital, with participation from T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Wellington Management.[6] Board members are Peter Fenton of Benchmark, Dan Scholnick of Trinity Ventures, Peter Currie of Currie Capital, Adam Messinger of Twitter,[7] Sarah Friar of Square,[8] and Lew Cirne.[9] New Relic went public on December 12, 2014.[10]
New Relic's technology, delivered in a software as a service (SaaS) model, was announced in 2013.[11] monitors Web and mobile applications in real-time[12][13][5][14] It allows developers to plug in technology from partners.[15]
Marketing[edit]
Partnerships include IBM Bluemix, Amazon Web Services, CloudBees, Engine Yard, Heroku, Joyent, Rackspace Hosting, and Microsoft Azure as well as mobile application backend service providers Appcelerator, Parse, and StackMob.[14][16][17][18]
Other marketing mentions:

San Francisco Business Times in 2012 and 2013.[19][20]
One of 2013 OnDemand 100 Top Private Companies[21]
2010 THINKstrategies’ Best of SaaS Showplace[22]
Top 20 Coolest Cloud Infrastructure Vendors (2010, CRN)[23]
10 IT Management Start-Ups to Watch (2008, NetworkWorld)[24]

Litigation[edit]
On November 5, 2012, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that New Relic violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions. The three patents in question are numbers U.S. Patent 7,225,361 B2; U.S. Patent 7,512,935 B1; and U.S. Patent 7,797,580 B2.[25] This is the first of two actions CA Technologies has filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology (the company that was also founded by Lew Cirne). In April 2013, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software developer AppDynamics. However, on April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [26]

Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Wellington Management.[6] Board members are Peter Fenton of Benchmark, Dan Scholnick of Trinity Ventures, Peter Currie of Currie Capital, Adam Messinger of Twitter,[7] Sarah Friar of Square,[8] and Lew Cirne.[9] New Relic went public on December 12, 2014.[10]
New Relic's technology, delivered in a software as a service (SaaS) model, was announced in 2013.[11] monitors Web and mobile applications in real-time[12][13][5][14] It allows developers to plug in technology from partners.[15]
Marketing[edit]
Partnerships include IBM Bluemix, Amazon Web Services, CloudBees, Engine Yard, Heroku, Joyent, Rackspace Hosting, and Microsoft Azure as well as mobile application backend service providers Appcelerator, Parse, and StackMob.[14][16][17][18]
Other marketing mentions:

San Francisco Business Times in 2012 and 2013.[19][20]
One of 2013 OnDemand 100 Top Private Companies[21]
2010 THINKstrategies’ Best of SaaS Showplace[22]
Top 20 Coolest Cloud Infrastructure Vendors (2010, CRN)[23]
10 IT Management Start-Ups to Watch (2008, NetworkWorld)[24]

Litigation[edit]
On November 5, 2012, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that New Relic violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions. The three patents in question are numbers U.S. Patent 7,225,361 B2; U.S. Patent 7,512,935 B1; and U.S. Patent 7,797,580 B2.[25] This is the first of two actions CA Technologies has filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology (the company that was also founded by Lew Cirne). In April 2013, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software developer AppDynamics. However, on April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [26]

Rowe Price, Benchmark Capital, Allen & Company, Trinity Ventures, Passport Capital, Dragoneer, and Tenaya Capital at a valuation of $750 million.[3][4] The funding round helped New Relic extend its software analytics platform to include Android and iOS native mobile apps.[5][3] In April 2014, New Relic raised another $100 million in funding led by BlackRock, Inc., and Passport Capital, with participation from T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Wellington Management.[6] Board members are Peter Fenton of Benchmark, Dan Scholnick of Trinity Ventures, Peter Currie of Currie Capital, Adam Messinger of Twitter,[7] Sarah Friar of Square,[8] and Lew Cirne.[9] New Relic went public on December 12, 2014.[10]
New Relic's technology, delivered in a software as a service (SaaS) model, was announced in 2013.[11] monitors Web and mobile applications in real-time[12][13][5][14] It allows developers to plug in technology from partners.[15]
Marketing[edit]
Partnerships include IBM Bluemix, Amazon Web Services, CloudBees, Engine Yard, Heroku, Joyent, Rackspace Hosting, and Microsoft Azure as well as mobile application backend service providers Appcelerator, Parse, and StackMob.[14][16][17][18]
Other marketing mentions:

San Francisco Business Times in 2012 and 2013.[19][20]
One of 2013 OnDemand 100 Top Private Companies[21]
2010 THINKstrategies’ Best of SaaS Showplace[22]

Litigation[edit]
On November 5, 2012, CA Technologies (formerly Computer Associates) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District in New York. The lawsuit claims that New Relic violated three patents that came into CA Technologies' possession through acquisitions. The three patents in question are numbers U.S. Patent 7,225,361 B2; U.S. Patent 7,512,935 B1; and U.S. Patent 7,797,580 B2.[25] This is the first of two actions CA Technologies has filed in connection with alleged infringement of patents obtained in the acquisition of Wily Technology (the company that was also founded by Lew Cirne). In April 2013, CA Technologies filed a lawsuit asserting patent infringement of the same three APM patents against software developer AppDynamics. However, on April 20, 2015 AppDynamics and CA settled the two-year-old patent dispute. AppDynamics said that it paid a "modest fixed payment." [26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
