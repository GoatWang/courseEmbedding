NSI-189:  Neuroregenerative Small Molecule
NSI-189 is the lead compound in our neurogenic small molecule drug discovery program. NSI-189 is being evaluated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Data suggest that NSI-189 works by promoting synaptogenesis or neurogenesis in the hippocampus; a different mechanism of action than currently marketed antidepressants. Results of the Phase 2 trial are expected in the third quarter of 2017.
Multiple data support NSI-189's neurogenic characteristics in preclinical models: Angelman Syndrome, irradiation-induced cognitive impairment, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and stroke. Additionally, NSI-189 produced a concentration and time dependent increase in the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP), a measure of synaptic plasticity which is an in vitro biomarker of memory.
View Candidate
NSI-566:  Cell Therapy
NSI-566, our lead cell therapy candidate, is a spinal-cord derived neural stem cell line. NSI-566 is being investigated for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), AIS-A complete chronic spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke.
Our technology enables the isolation and large-scale expansion of regionally specific, human neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord. This enables the generation of physiologically relevant human neurons of all types. We believe that our stem cell technology will assist the body in producing new cells to replace malfunctioning or dead cells as a way to treat disease and injury. Many significant and currently untreatable human diseases arise from the loss or malfunction of specific cell types in the body. Our stem cells may provide an effective method to protect such cell types and in certain cases to generate replacement cells from neural stem cells. We believe that protecting the healthy cells or replacing damaged, malfunctioning or dead neural cells with fully functional ones may be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating many diseases and conditions of the nervous system.

About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. ALS is an orphan condition in the U.S. and EU and approximately 6,400 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the condition each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that more than 20,000 Americans may be living with ALS at any given time. In ALS, nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition slowly gets worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe.
NSI-566 as a Potential Treatment
NSI-566 is under development as a potential treatment for ALS by providing cells designed to nurture and protect the patients' remaining motor neurons; and possibly repair some motor neurons which have not yet died but which are diseased. Neuralstem received orphan designation by the FDA for NSI-566 in ALS. NSI-566 was evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 safety studies in 30 patients. The data showed that the intraspinal transplantation of the cells was safe and well tolerated. Subjects from both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 continue to be monitored for long-term follow-up evaluations. To date, substantially all the clinical costs of our ALS studies have been funded by grants.
About Chronic Spinal Cord Injury
A spinal cord injury, or SCI, generally refers to any injury to the spinal cord that is caused by trauma instead of disease although in some cases, it can be the result of diseases. It is estimated that there are 12,500 new cases of SCI per year and that at any given time, there are between 240,000 and 337,000 people in the United States that are living with SCI. Chronic spinal cord injury generally refers to the phase beginning 6 months after the initial injury. SCIs are most often traumatic, caused by lateral bending, dislocation, rotation, axial loading, and hyperflexion or hyperextension of the cord or cauda equina. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of SCIs, while other causes include falls, work-related accidents, sports injuries, and penetrations such as stab or gunshot wounds. In certain instances, SCIs can also be of a non-traumatic origin, as in the case of cancer, infection, intervertebral disc disease, vertebral injury and spinal cord vascular disease.
NSI-566 as a Potential Treatment
We believe that NSI-566 may provide an effective treatment for chronic spinal cord injury by "bridging the gap" in the spinal cord circuitry created in traumatic spinal cord injury and providing new cells to help transmit the signal from the brain to points at or below the point of injury. We are carrying out a Phase 1 trial to test this possibility.
The study has enrolled four AIS-A thoracic spinal cord injury subjects (motor and sensory complete), one to two years post-injury at the time of stem cell treatment in a Phase 1 safety study. The stem cell treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated by the subjects enrolled and there were no serious adverse events at six-month post transplantation. Subjects are currently being monitored for long-term follow-up evaluations. The FDA has approved the protocol amendment to treat an additional cohort of four cervical spinal cord injury patients. Substantially all of the clinical costs of this study have been, and will continue to be, funded by grants arranged through UCSD.
About Ischemic Stroke
Ischemic strokes, the most common type of stroke, occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. Approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer stroke of which it is estimated that 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes. Post-stroke motor deficits include paralysis in arms and legs and can be permanent.
NSI-566 as a Potential Treatment
We believe that NSI-566 may provide an effective treatment for restoring motor deficits resulting from ischemic stroke by both creating new circuitry in the area of injury and through repairing and or nurturing diseased cells to improve function in patients. Currently Neuralstem is conducting a Phase 1 safety trial in 9 subjects with motor deficits due to ischemic stroke. The trial is being conducted at BaYi Brain Hospital in Beijing, China. Subjects are currently being monitored through their 24-month observational follow-up period. The trial is being conducted by Suzhou Neuralstem, a wholly owned subsidiary of Neuralstem in China.

About Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low self-esteem and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for persons age 15 to 44. In 2015, an estimated 16.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the U.S. had at least one major depressive episode in the prior year. This number represented 6.7% of all U.S. adults.1 Treatment of MDD is characterized by a high level of patient turnover due to low efficacy and high side effects. It is estimated that 67% of patients will fail their first line therapy, 75% will then fail their second line prescription2 and 80% will then fail their third line prescription. These factors combine to create a significant opportunity for a differentiated therapeutic agent, particularly one that may act through a novel mechanism of action with few side effects.

Accessed February 13, 2017.2 Rush AJ, Fava M, et al; STAR#D Investigators Group.Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D); rationale and design Control Clin Trials. 2004 Feb;25(1):119-42
NSI-189 as a Potential Treatment for MDD
NSI-189 is being developed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric and/or cognitive impairment indications associated with hippocampal atrophy. NSI-189 is the lead compound in our neurogenic small molecule drug discovery program.
We believe that NSI-189, which increases neurogenesis and hippocampal volume, may provide an effective treatment for patients suffering from MDD by promoting synaptogenesis or neurogenesis in the hippocampus. NSI-189 stimulates neurogenesis of human hippocampus derived neural stem cells in vitro and stimulates neurogenesis in young, normal, healthy mouse hippocampus in vivo. The neurogenic effect by NSI-189 is believed to have a highly specific effect in the hippocampus and subventricular zone, the two well-known neurogenic regions in adult CNS, and nowhere else in the CNS.
Preclinical Insight into NSI-189:  Potential for Broad Utility
Potential Treatment for Cognitive Impairment and Angelman Syndrome 
Treatment of normal mouse brain slices with NSI-189 produced a concentration and time dependent enhancement of the magnitude of long term potentiation (LTP), a measure of synaptic plasticity, which is an in vitro biomarker of memory. Additionally, NSI-189-induced LTP enhancement requires protein synthesis, suggesting structural synaptic plasticity.
NSI-189 treatment of brain slices from mice with a genetic defect that models Angelman Syndrome (which in humans leads to inherited intellectual disability) restored LTP to normal levels.
NSI-189 treatment ameliorated behavioral and memory function and preserved hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of cognitive impairment induced by irradiation.
Potential Treatment for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
NSI-189 was demonstrated to be effective in the prevention and reversal of peripheral neuropathies in a mouse model of Type 1 and preventative in a mouse model of Type 2 diabetes. Data from these studies, which includes reversal of neuropathic pain and decreased nerve conductance associated with the onset of diabetic symptoms, suggest that NSI-189 may have broad applicability in the treatment of central and peripheral neuropathies arising from diverse etiologies.
Potential Treatment for Ischemic Stroke
Oral administration of NSI-189 to mice with ischemic stroke led to a significant increase in neurogenesis in the hippocampus accompanied by a significant recovery from motor deficit. This evidence suggests that NSI-189 can induce recovery from stroke-induced brain damage. The improvements were maintained post the termination of NSI-189 therapy for an additional 12-week, drug-free, observational period. The sustained improvement suggests that NSI-189 initiated a host brain repair mechanism enabling tissue remodeling of the stroke brain. NSI-189 demonstrated the upregulation of growth factors such as stem cell factor (SCF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as well as increasing neurite outgrowth.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the proposed public offering. The offering is subject to market and other conditions and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including market conditions, risks associated with the cash requirements of our business and other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, and represent our views only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Such forward-looking statements relate to future, not past, events and may often be identified by words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "plan," "believe," "seek," "may" or "will." Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Specific risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements include risks inherent in the development and commercialization of potential products, uncertainty of clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances, need for future capital, dependence upon collaborators and maintenance of our intellectual property rights. Actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information on potential factors that could affect our results and other risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in Neuralstem's periodic reports, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 23, 2017, and in other reports filed with the SEC. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

UPDATE: Neuralstem stock plummets 61% on news of mid-stage clinical trial miss
Neuralstem Inc.  shares plummeted 61% in premarket trade Tuesday on news of a mid-stage clinical trial miss for its major depressive disorder drug. The drug, NSI-189, did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in depression symptoms. The company said that the drug did meet a secondary efficacy endpoint of statistical significance on the patient-rated Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire. That secondary endpoint was one of two that the company said it has analyzed so far. "We are encouraged by its emerging clinical profile, and continuing the clinical evaluation of NSI-189 to pursue its full potential is warranted," Dr. Maurizio Fava, the trial's principal investigator, said. Neuralstem shares have surged 12.3% over the last three months to $5.58, compared with a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Neuralstem stock plummets 61% on news of mid-stage clinical trial miss
Neuralstem Inc.  shares plummeted 61% in premarket trade Tuesday on news of a mid-stage clinical trial miss for its major depressive disorder drug. The drug, NSI-189, did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in depression symptoms. The company said that the drug did meet a secondary efficacy endpoint of statistical significance on the patient-rated Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire. That secondary endpoint was one of two that the company said it has analyzed so far. "We are encouraged by its emerging clinical profile, and continuing the clinical evaluation of NSI-189 to pursue its full potential is warranted," Dr. Maurizio Fava, the trial's principal investigator, said. Neuralstem shares have surged 12.3% over the last three months to $5.58, compared with a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500 .

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
