What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

Layer opened.Read the transcript







Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing. Important information All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, or other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

Getting job at Vanguard Charlotte Office?


Quote


Postby kingjimmy » Sat Sep 07, 2013 9:59 pm 
HelloI didn't realize it until today, but I recently discovered that Vanguard has a corporate office here in Charlotte, NC, where I live. I'm already involved in the banking world and work as a mortgage underwriter. Honestly I feel my particular niche in the underwriting world only has about 5-10 years left as far as job security, as my position is very specialized and highly dependent on the winds that blow in Washington. I highly enjoy issues related to personal finance and of late have been thinking of ways I might eventually move out of my current job into something else. I very much buy into the investment philosophy of Jack Bogle, having read several Boglehead books, and think that a career at Vanguard could be something I enjoy. I'm very analytical and am a people person. I have a couple years experience in underwriting, and have had to appear in court hundreds of times on behalf of my bank to represent the bank in foreclosure matters.With that said, is anybody here on the forum aware of the type of positions that are typically available at the Charlotte office? How many people work there? What's the corporate culture like? How does one get their foot in the door, and what's the pay like? What does Vanguard usually look for in new employees?Any insights would be appreciated.ThanksJimmy

I do not know for sure all the functions and services Vanguard has in Charlotte. I do know they have a sizable technology unit and I met a guy this spring who manages a wealth management group based in Charlotte. They also have a call center. It sounds like they may be opportunities for you there. Best wishes.

This thread is now in the Personal Finance (Not Investing) forum (employment).Your prior career choice thread: Get an MBA or Invest?I would assume that working for Vanguard is no different than any other Investment management company. The job might be great, but you don't get along with your manager. Or, the job might not turn out to what you thought you'd be doing.In any case, I want to point out that while this forum promotes Vanguard as a low-cost investment choice, there is no connection to the company itself. If Schwab or Fidelity was cheaper, we'd be promoting those companies (which we do, when appropriate).Your best chance of finding out about Vanguard employment is to ask them directly.
 To some, the glass is half full. To others, the glass is half empty. To an engineer, it's twice the size it needs to be.

Vanguard mutual funds are individual business companies, and some of those companies have "Charlotte" in the name. Indeed, the new International Bond Index Fund is one of them. From the Statement of Additional Information:"Vanguard Charlotte Funds (the Trust) currently offers the following fund and share classes (identified by ticker symbol)..."I have no idea whether this fund has any particular connection with the Charlotte office, or whether it's just something they picked as an apropos name. But anyway, if nothing else, it's something you can ask about at the job interview in order to put up a show of having tried to find out about the company.

I was friends with his wife from my work. He had positive experiences to say and was happy to hear I already was a Vanguard client. But as with most any job, your direct manager setting your responsibilities and your division manager setting policy and goals will make all the difference in the world. As others have suggested, it could be a good talking point in the interview to asks about the corporate culture with how Vanguard is structured. I'll bet it's likely very different than the megabank culture.As a side note, depending on which niche area of mortgage underwriting you are in, Teachers aka TIAA-Cref has recently been looking for portfolio analysts in their lending group.

I've investigated this path as well.  I've talked with several vanguard employees (thanks linkedin) in both Charlotte and Valley Forge.  It seems that they really like to hire from within and do most of their hiring for the phone support positions.  If you want to do that for a while and gain some great experience, it would likely be a fun job.  According to my friend who works in the Charlotte office, phone reps start at about 45k.

Jimmy:I recall several  years ago when I called my Vanguard representative to ask a question about index funds.  He asked me to please wait.A short time later a voice came on saying "I know a little bit about index funds.  How can I help you."  There was a lot of laughter in the room and I recognized the voice of Jack Bogle.  He  was visiting the Charlotte office.Best wishes.Taylor

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
