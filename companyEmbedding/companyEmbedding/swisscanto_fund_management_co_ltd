The investments in the Balanced subfund are split fairly evenly between fixed-interest paper and equities. The equity allocation is limited to a maximum of 50% on grounds of risk considerations. Despite its broadly diversified range of investments, the portfolio´s sizeable equity component means that it carries substantially greater risk than the Yield subfund. However, its earnings prospects can also be assumed to be higher. As investors in the Balanced subfund wish to receive a regular flow of income, the subfund holds out the prospect of an appropriate annual distribution of interest income and dividends.

Investments in the (Euro) Balanced subfund are split fairly evenly between fixed-interest paper and equities. The equity allocation is limited to a maximum of 50% on grounds of risk considerations. Despite its broadly diversified range of investments, the portfolio´s substantial equity component means that it carries a relatively high risk.

Medium

The Growth subfund invests throughout the world in stocks and fixed-interest securities. Stocks always constitute more than 50% of the fund, and are therefore largely responsible for the characteristics of the portfolio. This means that the risk that the price of an investment will change is relatively large. However, this risk is typically associated with the prospect of higher long-term growth. The risk arising from foreign exchange fluctuations is also reduced in the Growth portfolio. As investors in the Growth subfund are mainly interested in short-term price increases, no income distribution is made; interest income and dividends are reinvested.

The Equity subfund invests in a very broadly diversified range of stocks throughout the world. This means that the weighting of individual markets does not reflect their capitalisation and that the Swiss domestic market does not dominate the fund. Only equity investments are permitted; maximum liquidity is 10% of the value of assets. In some cases, foreign currencies are hedged against the Swiss franc. As investors in the Equity subfund are mainly interested in short-term price increases, no income distribution is made; dividends are continually reinvested.

Group


A strong partner for investment and pension services
The Cantonal bank's competence centre
Swisscanto: As a specialised service provider, Swisscanto concentrates on the development and marketing of high-quality investment and pension products for private clients, companies and institutional clients: 


Investment funds
Linked and free pension products (3rd pillar) 
Occupational pension solutions (2nd pillar)
Pension fund consulting and administration
Collective assets of the Investment Foundation
Asset management mandates for institutional investors


Strong position in a fiercely contested market
Swisscanto offers its clients a range of products that suit their requirements and are distinguished by an outstanding price/performance ratio. The Cantonal banks, for their part, are present in the whole of Switzerland with their blanket-coverage network of branches, and are well known for their customer proximity and highly efficient sales and advisory organisation. The competitive advantages result from efficiently linking the core competencies of the Swisscanto product specialist with those of the qualified customer adviser.
Thanks to the continuity and constancy of its success, Swisscanto is a highly competitive and reliable partner today. The company acquired its strong market position as an asset manager through its above-average track record. The success is sustainable: In the past few years, Swisscanto has been repeatedly honoured nationally and internationally as the best fund company. The superior performance emphasises the professionalism and competence of the Swisscanto Group's employees. The performance-oriented corporate culture enables highly qualified members of staff to give a top performance in a challenging, demanding and motivating environment.
Swisscanto for private clients
Investment funds - Ideal components for investment strategies
Over the past few years, Swisscanto has consolidated its strong position as an important player in the Swiss fund market. As the centre of competence for the Cantonal bank's fund business, Swisscanto concentrates on the development and marketing of investment funds in accordance with Swiss and Luxembourg Law. In Switzerland, marketing is carried out primarily through the Cantonal banks, but also through insurance companies, further banks and asset managers, as well as through purposefully selected marketing partners in the adjoining countries.
Swisscanto places a range of clearly structured investment funds at the customer adviser's disposal for individual investment strategies. As components in modern asset management, they meet nearly all investor requirements.
Swisscanto's investment funds, that are managed professionally and for a reasonable fee, include: 


Money market funds
Bond funds
Equity funds 
Portfolio funds
Real estate funds
Fund of Hedge Funds


With regard to performance, Swisscanto figures among the leading providers throughout Europe. The quality of the funds is scrutinised regularly by independent analysis and rating companies. Swisscanto investment funds are awarded national and international prizes every year on account of their first-class peer-group performance. Lipper and Standard and Poor's have honoured Swisscanto in the past few years with numerous Fund Awards for individual funds, fund categories and for the above-average performance of the entire range of funds.
Swisscanto Fund Desk Fund trading 'a la carte' 
Swisscanto makes a trading platform available to the Cantonal banks and other fund marketers for handling both Swisscanto funds as well as third-party funds. There are contractual relations with practically all major Swiss and international fund providers, which makes it possible to offer a wide range of investment funds on very attractive terms. Fund Desk clients are provided with an efficient service for placing, transacting and invoicing orders, as well as with portfolio management and reporting services. The client profits from the cost advantages of a fully automated process for his fund business.
Pension products - Additional benefits for private clients
Swisscanto offers a well-defined range of standardised pension products, which it develops and manages primarily for marketing through the Cantonal banks. The products are specially designed for marketing through banks so that they will bring a clearly apparent additional benefit for private clients in combination with other bank products. In the case of a fund-linked insurance within the framework of free pension products (pillar 3b), the client profits not only from tax-free investment income, but also from all the advantages of a life insurance. Or the fund saving plan: With its extremely flexible paying-in arrangements and the option to invest in fund units, it acquires the characteristics of a retirement pension product through its organisation as a withdrawal scheme.
Swisscanto's pension products are designed for the long term so that expectations aroused at the time of concluding the agreement can indeed be fulfilled after five, ten or even more years. Safeguarding one's personal future is dependent on competent advice: An individual pension solution can only be developed with the support of an acknowledged expert. In this connection, the pension advice offered by the Cantonal banks has proved itself. Through a dynamic advisory process, the relevant questions concerning pensions are answered within the framework of an integral overall concept. Swisscanto provides competitive products for this process.
Maximise yields with securities saving and the Swisscanto Investment Foundation
Assets in the Cantonal banks' tax-privileged Savings 3 pension accounts are intended to earn as attractive a yield as possible within the statutory limits. Within the framework of securities saving, these pension monies can be invested in investment groups of the Swisscanto Investment Foundation. These investment groups always comply with the statutory investment regulations stipulated by BVV2. Those engaging in securities saving can thus participate in developments both in the economy and on the stock market. 
Swisscanto for companies and institutions
Occupational pensions
Swisscanto offers companies mainly standard schemes to cover their occupational pension requirements, schemes that are easily understandable and can be administered at a reasonable cost. At the same time, these schemes are sufficiently flexible to allow for clients' individual requirements to be satisfied. 
Swisscanto Collective Foundation
Since its establishment in 1973, the Swisscanto Collective Foundation has developed into one of the most important bank foundations in the staff pension sector in Switzerland. Flexible solutions to suit requirements in the compulsory sector of occupational pension planning, as well as easily understandable standard schemes that can be administered at a reasonable cost, enjoy top priority. Under certain conditions, the Swisscanto Collective Foundation also offers help with the preparation of individual pension schemes. Furthermore, the affiliated pension institutions have the possibility of influencing how their saving funds are invested, provided certain requirements are met.
Swisscanto Supra Collective Foundation 
The subsidiary foundation Swisscanto Supra, as a specialist in the supra-compulsory sector, principally covers requirements going beyond the compulsory BVG pension cover. It offers solutions in line with the needs of senior management so as to avoid any pension gaps, and achieves improvements in benefits for certain categories of persons.
Swisscanto Vested Benefits Foundation
The Swisscanto Vested Benefits Foundation offers services for Cantonal banks which can not or do not want to establish a foundation of their own to run vested benefits accounts. If an employee gives up gainful employment temporarily (e.g. on account of further training, a stay abroad, or also because of unemployment), his pension credit balance can be invested in a vested benefits account of the Swisscanto Vested Benefits Foundation. 
Staff pension solutions for companies as an integrated whole
The Swisscanto Collective Foundations' most important partners, apart from the Cantonal banks as marketing partners, are the Swisscanto Investment Foundation, which is responsible for investment management, and Helvetia Patria as risk insurer. Simple, transparent products, optimal advice as well as a professional investment management are the main advantages of a Swisscanto staff pension solution.
Pension fund consulting and administration
Swisscanto is the competent partner for your occupational pensions. No matter whether your pension institution is autonomous, semi-autonomous, fully insured, affiliated to a collective or joint institution: Swisscanto will always find the right answers to you're the client's questions.
Pension fund consulting
Swisscanto advises its clients on all legal, actuarial, personnel and economic questions related to staff pension planning. It does not make any difference whether occupational pensions are provided through autonomous, semi-autonomous, fully reinsured (company's own) pension institutions or through the affiliation to a collective or joint institution. Within the scope of a mandate Swisscanto analyses the existing solution, proposes alternatives and realises the specific solution(s) selected by the client. Thanks to our independence, our proximity to the market and our know-how, the client gains direct access to the pension solutions that suit him best.
Pension fund administration
Various circumstances may cause a pension institution to outsource the administration of a pension fund into competent hands. Swisscanto provides for a professional operation of your pension scheme an important and cost-intensive part of the human resources department with utmost discretion and attention. We offer professional solutions with full cost transparency. Our experience over many years, state-of-the-art technical equipment, but above all a highly motivated and qualified team are the key to our success.
Pension fund experts
Our certified experts for occupational pension plans run mandates in accordance with art. 53 para. 2 BVG and perceive it as their permanent obligation to optimise their clients' pension schemes under consideration of the specific needs of the company and the social and legal changes. 
They support pension funds or companies in particular in a significantly changing environment, as for example in the event of a merger or an acquisition: from the due diligence process through partial liquidation to the implementation of a new pension solution or the integration of the new workforce into the existing pension fund. The actuaries perform calculations and prepare reports in accordance with international and national accounting standards such as IAS 19, FRS17, FER16, etc.
Swisscanto for institutional investors
Consistently implemented investment philosophy
Swisscanto is an acknowledged specialist in institutional asset management. The portfolio management benefits from the investment specialists' first-class qualifications and many years of professional experience in three respects:


in the case of the Swisscanto investment funds, 
in the case of the collective assets of the Swisscanto Investment Foundation, and
in the case of the asset management mandates for institutional investors.


Swisscanto's portfolio management is based on the latest findings of modern portfolio theory; here, particular importance is attached to controlling and steering investment risks. 
For years, Swisscanto has been positioning itself successfully by means of the risk premium approach. The starting point for strategic investment decisions are relative assessments: Swisscanto's portfolio managers look actively for investment opportunities on the market with which they achieve improvements in value for clients in the form of above-average earnings adjusted for risks. The investment philosophy is implemented systematically and consistently with the help of the latest quantitative analysis methods.
When arranging the asset management mandates for institutional clients, Swisscanto intensively takes account of individual needs and requirements. The choice of the strategic asset allocation is dependent on the investment objectives and the ability to take risks. Thanks to its know-how and experience, the Swisscanto specialists have clear ideas on the suitability of different benchmark variants and are in a position to give professional advice at every decision level.
Swisscanto Investment Foundation Elements for your investment success
The Swisscanto Investment Foundation today figures among the largest and best known investment foundations in Switzerland. Its object is the collective management of assets which have been entrusted to it by Swiss pension funds and the holders of vested benefits and/or Savings 3 accounts with Cantonal banks. Investors are given the opportunity of cost-effectively participating in professionally managed special assets that are exempt from tax.
For years, Swisscanto portfolio managers have successfully managed the securities assets of the Investment Foundation, in accordance with clear guidelines from the board of trustees, the investment commission and the executive board of the Investment Foundation. The Swisscanto Investment Foundation's investment groups are regularly to be found in the front ranks of the evaluations published by the independent rating company Watson Wyatt.
