Ramport Studios - Wikipedia





















 






Ramport Studios

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Ramport Studios was a South London recording studio on Thessaly Road owned by The Who.[1] Several major albums were recorded at Ramport, including the 1974 album Crime of the Century by the progressive rock band Supertramp. Judas Priest also recorded their album Sin After Sin during 1976–1977. The 1973 album Quadrophenia was recorded there. Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers spent much of the summer of 1977 recording and mixing the album L.A.M.F. there for The Who's label Track Records. Eventually, Virgin Records acquired it. It is currently now used as a doctor's surgery.[2]

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Basis of Presentation

Edgeworth Investments, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under
the laws
of the State of Delaware on July 24, 2008 and has been inactive
since
inception.  The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to
effect an asset
acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business
combination
with a domestic or foreign business.

The Company has not earned any revenue from operations. 
Accordingly, the
Company's activities have been accounted for as those of a
"Development Stage
Enterprise" as set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No.
7 ("SFAS 7").  The Company's financial statements are
identified as those of a
development stage company, and that the statements of operations,
stockholders'
equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the
Company's
inception.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting Method

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of
accounting. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on
December 31.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of  assets  and 
liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity
of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes.  A
deferred tax
asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences
between financial
and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. 
Deferred tax expense
(benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred
tax assets
and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when,
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion of
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax
assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
rates on
the date of enactment. There were no current or deferred income tax
expenses or
benefits due to the Company not having any material operations for
period ended
March 31, 2010.

Earnings per Share

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share"
("EPS").  SFAS No. 128 provides for the calculation of basic
and diluted
earnings per share.   Basic EPS includes no dilution and
is computed by
dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in
the earnings
or losses of the entity.  Such amounts include shares
potentially issuable
pursuant to shares to be issued, convertible debentures and
outstanding options
and warrants.

Impact of New Accounting Standards

The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued
accounting
pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company's results
of
operations, financial position, or cash flow.

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"), and have been prepared on a
going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of
liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company
currently has no
source of revenue to cover its costs.  The Company will limit
all operational
activities to searching and consummating a business
combination.  The Company
will offer non-cash consideration and seek equity lines as the sole
method of
financing for the near term.  If the Company is unable to
secure financing
until a business combination is consummated, it may substantially
limit or
terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities
through strategic
alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the
interests of
existing stockholders.

NOTE 4 - SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY

On July 24, 2008, the Board of Directors issued 31,340,000 shares
of common
stock for $3,134 in services to the founding shareholder of the
Company to fund
organizational start-up costs.

The Company has the following classes of capital stock as of March
31, 2010:

Common stock - 250,000,000 shares authorized; $0.0001 par value;
31,340,000
shares issued and outstanding.

Preferred stock - 20,000,000 shares authorized; $0.0001 par value;
no shares
issued and outstanding.






Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and
        Results of
Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with our
financial statements and notes to the financial statements included
elsewhere
in this report as well as the Form 10-12G registration statement.
This report
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and
Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act.  We
intend that the forward-looking statements be subject to the safe
harbors
created by those sections.

PLAN OF OPERATION; GOING CONCERN

BACKGROUND OF THE COMPANY

Edgeworth Investments, Inc. (the "Company") was organized on July
24, 2008, as
a blank check or shell company under the Laws of the State of
Delaware. The
Company does not currently engage in any business activities that
provide cash
flow. From inception, the primary activity of the Company has been
directed
towards organizational efforts, compliance matters and locating
potential
merger or acquisition candidates. The Company's primary purpose is
to engage in
a merger with or acquisition of one or more private domestic or
foreign
companies.

The Company is continuing its efforts to locate a merger candidate
for the
purpose of a merger. It is possible that the Company will be
successful in
locating such a merger candidate and closing such merger. However,
if the
Company cannot effect a non-cash acquisition, the Company may have
to raise
funds from a private offering of its securities under Rule 506 of
Regulation D.
There is no assurance the Company would obtain any such equity
funding.

The Company is still a "blank check" or "shell" company. At
present, the
Company has no business opportunities under contemplation for
acquisition or
merger.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Company's activities since inception have been limited to
organizational
matters, compliance efforts and locating potential merger
candidates, and the
Company has not engaged in any operating activity since its
inception.

The Company has registered its Common Stock on a Form 10-SB
registration
statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the Exchange
Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with the U.S.
Securities and
Exchange Commission periodic reports under Rule 13(a) of the
Exchange Act,
including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form
10-K.

The Company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition of
an
unidentified domestic or foreign company which desires to become a
U.S.
reporting (public) company whose securities are qualified for
trading in the
United States secondary market. The Company meets the definition of
a blank
check company contained in Section 7(b)(3) of the Securities Act of
1933, as
amended.

The Company believes that there are perceived benefits to being a
reporting
company with a class of publicly-traded securities which may be
attractive to
foreign and domestic private companies.

These benefits are commonly thought to include:

  (1) the ability to use registered shares to make acquisition
of assets or
      businesses;

  (2) increased visibility in the financial community;

  (3) the facilitation of borrowing from financial
institutions;

  (4) improved trading efficiency;

  (5) shareholder liquidity;

  (6) greater ease in subsequently raising capital;

  (7) compensation of key employees through options for stock
for which there
      is a public market;

  (8) enhanced corporate image; and,

  (9) a presence in the United States capital market.

A private company which may be interested in a business combination
with the
Company may include the following:

  (1) a Company for which a primary purpose of becoming public
is the use of
      its securities for the acquisition
of assets or businesses;

  (2) a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its
securities or
      is unable to find an underwriter of
securities on terms acceptable to it;

  (3) a company which wishes to become public with less
dilution of its Common
      Stock than would occur normally upon
an underwriting;

  (4) a company which believes that it will be able to obtain
investment
      capital on more favorable terms
after it has become public;

  (5) a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into
the United States
      securities market;

  (6) a special situation company, such as a company seeking a
public market
      to satisfy redemption requirements
under a qualified Employee Stock
      Option Plan; and,

  (7) a company seeking one or more of the other benefits
believed to attach to
      a public company.

The Company is authorized to enter into a definitive agreement with
a wide
variety of private businesses without limitation as to their
industry or
revenues. It is not possible at this time to predict with which
private
company, if any, the Company will enter into a definitive agreement
or what
will be the industry, ope
