Philippe Chambon, MD, PhD,  career in Venture Capital started in 1995 when he joined The Sprout Group. Prior to that, he served as Manager in the Healthcare Practice of The Boston Consulting Group from 1993 to 1995.  From 1987 to 1993, he was an executive with Sandoz Pharmaceutical, where he led strategic product development, portfolio management and pre-marketing activities in his capacity as Executive Director of New Product Management.  Philippe did graduate research in molecular immunology at The Pasteur Institute and earned a M.D., Ph.D. from the University of Paris.  Philippe also has an M.B.A. from Columbia University in New York.
Philippe is a Senior Advisor to New Leaf Venture Partners.  He was a founder of New Leaf and served as a Managing Director until he transitioned to Senior Advisor in 2017.  As a Senior Advisor, Philippe provides high level advice to New Leaf, and devotes time and effort to sourcing and managing French healthcare technology investment opportunities.
New Leaf Venture Partners was formed in 2005, when the healthcare team of The Sprout Group, a unit of Credit Suisse, spun out to form a new, independent venture capital firm.  The New Leaf team evolved over the last two decades as it managed healthcare technology portfolios in four Sprout funds and four New Leaf funds.   Philippe played a key role in building the team at Sprout, and led the spin-off of the healthcare team into New Leaf Venture Partners.  Philippe’s strong relationships with both limited partners and entrepreneurs, as well as his deep understanding of the life sciences industry, made important contributions towards the strategy and success of the firm.  Philippe also played critical roles in the firm’s successful fundraising efforts across four New Leaf funds and was the driving force in developing the firm’s public investing effort.
New Leaf thanks Philippe for his tireless efforts in co-founding and building New Leaf Venture Partners.
