2.  In  any  Certificate  Year  after the first,  Certificate  Owners  may
withdraw, in addition to the amount available in 1., the amount by which  10%   
of  the Certificate Value as of the preceding Certificate Anniversary exceeds   
the amount available in 1.                                                      

2This  charge  will  be waived on the first Certificate  Anniversary  and  in   
certain   other  instances  (see  "Deductions  for  Certificate   Maintenance
Charge").  Keyport reserves the right to impose a transfer  fee  after  prior   
notice  to  Certificate  Owners, but currently does not  impose  any  charge.   
Premium taxes are not shown. Keyport deducts the amount of premium taxes,  if   
any, when paid unless Keyport elects to defer such deduction.                   

3All Trust and Fund expenses are for 1996. The Alliance Series Fund, Colonial   
Trust  (Colonial  Strategic  Income only),  MFS  Trust,  and  SteinRoe  Trust   
(SteinRoe  Mortgage Securities Income only) expenses reflect such  Fund's  or   
Trust's  adviser's agreement to reimburse expenses above certain limits  (see   
footnote 4).                                                                    

4Expense  information  shown for Alliance Series Fund has  been  restated  to   
reflect  current  fees  and is net of voluntary expense  reimbursements.  The   
Alliance  Series Fund Adviser has agreed to continue such reimbursements  for   
the  foreseeable future. Each percentage shown in the parentheses is what the   
total expenses would be in the absence of expense reimbursement: for Alliance   
Global Bond--1.15%; and for Alliance Premier Growth--1.23%.                     

Colonial  Trust's manager has agreed until 4/30/98 to reimburse all expenses,   
including  management  fees,  in excess of the following  percentage  of  the   
average  annual net assets of each Fund, so long as such reimbursement  would   
not  result  in  the  Fund's inability to qualify as a  regulated  investment   
company  under the Internal Revenue Code: 1.00% for Colonial Growth & Income,   
Colonial Utilities and Colonial U.S. Stock; 1.75% for Colonial Int'l Fund for   
Growth  and  Colonial-Newport Tiger; and .80% for Colonial Strategic  Income.   
For  Colonial  Strategic Income, the total .80% shown in the table  is  after   
expense reimbursement and the .86% shown in the parentheses is what the total   
for 1996 would be in the absence of expense reimbursement.                      

MFS  Trust's  Adviser has agreed to bear, subject to reimbursement,  expenses   
for  each  of  the  two  Eligible Funds shown such  that  each  Fund's  total   
operating  expenses shall not exceed, on an annualized basis,  1.25%  of  the   
average  daily  net assets of the Fund from January 1, 1997 through  December
31,  1998, and 1.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund from January
1, 1999 through December 31, 2004; provided however, that this obligation may   
be  terminated  or  revised  at  any  time.  Each  percentage  shown  in  the   
parentheses  is  what the total expenses would be in the absence  of  expense   
reimbursement: for MFS Emerging Growth--1.16%; and for MFS Research--1.48%.     

SteinRoe  Trust's adviser has voluntarily agreed until 4/30/98  to  reimburse   
all   expenses,  including  management  fees,  in  excess  of  the  following   
percentage  of the average annual net assets of each Fund, so  long  as  such   
reimbursement  would  not  result in the Fund's inability  to  qualify  as  a   
regulated  investment  company  under the Internal  Revenue  Code:  .80%  for   
SteinRoe Capital Appreciation and SteinRoe Managed Growth Stock; .65% for       
SteinRoe Cash Income; .75% for SteinRoe Managed Assets; and .70% for SteinRoe   
Mortgage Securities  Income. For SteinRoe Mortgage Securities Income, the       
total .70% shown in the table is after expense reimbursement and the .72%       
shown in  the parentheses  is  what the total for 1996 would be in the absence  
of  expense reimbursement.                                                      

5The  annuity is designed for retirement planning purposes. Surrenders  prior   
to  the  Income  Date are not consistent with the long-term purposes  of  the   
Certificate and the applicable tax laws.                                        

The  examples  should not be considered a representation of  past  or  future   
expenses  and charges of the Sub-Accounts. Actual expenses may be greater  or   
less than those shown. Similarly, the assumed 5% annual rate of return is not   
an estimate or a guarantee of future investment performance. See "Deductions"   
in  this  prospectus, "Management of the Fund" in the prospectuses for  Alger   
American  Fund and the Alliance Series Fund, "Trust Management Organizations"   
and "Expenses of the Funds" in the prospectus for Colonial Trust, "Management   
of  the Series" and "Expenses" in the prospectus for MFS Trust, and "How  the   
Funds are Managed" in the prospectus for SteinRoe Trust.                        

SYNOPSIS    

The  following  Synopsis  should  be read in conjunction  with  the  detailed   
information  in this prospectus and the Statement of Additional  Information.   
Please  refer  to  the Glossary of Special Terms for the meaning  of  certain   
defined  terms. Variations from the information appearing in this  prospectus   
due  to individual state requirements are described in supplements which  are   
attached  to  this  prospectus, or in endorsements to  the  Certificates,  as   
appropriate.                                                                    

The  Certificate allows Certificate Owners to allocate Purchase  Payments  to   
the Variable Account and also to the Fixed Account. The Variable Account is a   
separate investment account maintained by Keyport. The Fixed Account is  part   
of Keyport's "general account", which consists of all Keyport's assets except   
the  Variable  Account and the assets of other separate  investment  accounts   
maintained  by  Keyport.  Certificate Owners may allocate  payments  to,  and   
receive  annuity payments from the Variable Account and/or the Fixed Account.   
If  the  Certificate  Owner allocates payments to the Variable  Account,  the   
accumulation  values  and annuity payments will fluctuate  according  to  the   
investment  experience of the Sub-Accounts chosen. If the  Certificate  Owner   
allocates  payments  to  the  Fixed Account,  the  accumulation  values  will   
increase at guaranteed interest rates and annuity payments will be of a fixed   
amount.  Fixed  Account  Values  are  subject  to  a  limited  market   value   
adjustment.  (See "Keyport and the Variable Account" on Page 6  for  more       
information  on  the  Variable Account and Appendix A on  Page  27  for  more   
information  on  the  Fixed  Account.) If  the  Certificate  Owner  allocates   
payments  to both Accounts, then the accumulation values and annuity payments   
will be variable in part and fixed in part.                                     

The  Certificate permits Purchase Payments to be made on a flexible  Purchase   
Payment basis. The minimum initial payment is $5,000. The minimum amount  for   
each subsequent payment is $1,000 or such lesser amount as Keyport may permit   
from time to time (currently $250). (See "Purchase Payments" on Page 9.)        

There are no deductions made from Purchase Payments for sales charges at  the   
time  of purchase. A Contingent Deferred Sales Charge may be deducted in  the   
event  of  a  total or partial surrender (see "Surrender" on Page  20).  The    
Contingent  Deferred Sales Charge is based on a graded table of charges.  The   
charge  will  not  exceed 7% of that portion of the amount  surrendered  that   
represents   Purchase  Payments  made  during  the  seven  years  immediately   
preceding the request for surrender. (See "Deductions for Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge" on Page 14.)                                                      

Keyport  deducts a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge, which is  equal  on  an   
annual  basis to 1.25% of the average daily net asset values in the  Variable   
Account attributable to the Certificates. (See "Deductions for Mortality  and
Expense  Risk  Charge" on Page 14.) Keyport also deducts a daily distribution   
charge  which  is equal on an annual basis to .15% of the same  values.  (See   
"Deductions for Daily Distribution Charge" on Page 14.)                         

Keyport  deducts an annual Certificate Maintenance Charge (currently  $36.00)   
from  the  Variable Account Value for administrative expenses. Prior  to  the   
Income  Date,  Keyport reserves the right to change this  charge  for  future   
years.  Keyport will in certain instances waive this charge. (See "Deductions
for Certificate Maintenance Charge" on Page 13.)                                

Keyport  reserves  the right to deduct a charge of $25 for each  transfer  in   
excess  of  12  per  Certificate Year but currently  does  not  do  so.  (See   
"Transfer of Variable Account Value" on Page 12.)                               

Premium  taxes will be charged against the Certificate Value. Currently  such   
premium  taxes range from 0% to 5.0%. (See "Deductions for Premium Taxes"  on   
Page 15.)                                                                       

There  are no federal income taxes on increases in the value of a Certificate   
until  a  distribution  occurs, in the form of a lump  sum  payment,  annuity   
payments, or the making of a gift or assignment of the Certificate. A federal   
penalty tax (currently 10%) may also apply. (See "Tax Status" on Page 22.)      

The  Certificate  allows  the Certificate Owner  to  revoke  the  Certificate   
generally within 10 days of delivery (see "Right to Revoke" on Page 18).  For   
most  states,  Keyport will refund the Certificate Value as of the  date  the   
returned  Certificate  is received by Keyport, plus any distribution  charges   
previously deducted. The Certificate Owner thus will bear the investment risk   
during  the revocation period. In other states, Keyport will return  Purchase   
Payments.

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION   

The  Variable  Account  may from time to time advertise  certain  performance   
information concerning its various Sub-Accounts.                                

Certain  of  the Eligible Funds have been available for Keyport  and/or  non-   
Keyport  variable annuity contracts for periods prior to the commencement  of   
the   offering  of  the  Certificates  described  in  this  prospectus.   Any   
performance  information  for such periods will be based  on  the  historical   
results  of  the  Eligible  Funds being applied to the  Certificate  for  the   
specified time periods.                                                         

Performance  information is not intended to indicate either past  performance   
under an actual Certificate or future performance.                              

The  Sub-Accounts may advertise total return information for various  periods   
of  time.  Total  return  performance information is  based  on  the  overall   
percentage change in value of a hypothetical investment in the specific  Sub-   
Account over a given period of time.                                            

Average  annual total return information shows the average percentage  change   
in  the value of an investment in the Sub-Account from the beginning date  of   
the measuring period to the end of that period. This standardized version  of   
average annual total return reflects all historical investment results,  less   
all  charges and deductions applied against the Sub-Account and a Certificate   
(including  any  Contingent  Deferred Sales Charge  that  would  apply  if  a   
Certificate  Owner  surrendered the Certificate at the  end  of  each  period   
indicated). Average total return does not take into account any premium taxes   
and would be lower if these taxes were included.                                

In order to calculate average annual total return, Keyport divides the change   
in  value  of  a Sub-Account under a Certificate surrendered on a  particular   
date  by  a  hypothetical $1,000 investment in the Sub-Account  made  by  the   
Certificate  Owner at the beginning of the period illustrated. The  resulting   
total  rate  for  the period is then annualized to obtain the average  annual   
percentage  change  during  the  period.  Annualization  assumes   that   the   
application  of  a  single rate of return each year during  the  period  will   
produce the ending value, taking into account the effect of compounding.        

The Sub-Accounts may present additional total return information computed  on   
a different basis.                                                              

First, the Sub-Accounts may present total return information computed on  the   
same  basis  as  described  above, except deductions  will  not  include  the   
Contingent  Deferred  Sales  Charge.  This  presentation  assumes  that   the   
investment in the Certificate continues beyond the period when the Contingent   
Deferred  Sales Charge applies, consistent with the long-term investment  and   
retirement  objectives of the Certificate. The total return  percentage  will   
thus be higher under this method than the standard method described above.      

Second,  the Sub-Accounts may present total return information calculated  by   
dividing  the  change  in  a Sub-Account's Accumulation  Unit  value  over  a   
specified  time period by the Accumulation Unit value of that Sub-Account  at   
the  beginning  of the period. This computation results in a 12-month  change   
rate  or,  for  longer  periods, a total rate for the  period  which  Keyport   
annualizes  in  order to obtain the average annual percentage change  in  the   
Accumulation Unit value for that period. The change percentages do  not  take   
into   account   the  Contingent  Deferred  Sales  Charge,  the   Certificate   
Maintenance Charge and premium tax charges. The percentages would be lower if   
these charges were included.                                                    

The  SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account is a money market Sub-Account that also   
may  advertise yield and effective yield information. The yield of  the  Sub-   
Account  refers  to the income generated by an investment in the  Sub-Account   
over  a  specifically identified 7-day period. This income is  annualized  by   
assuming  that the amount of income generated by the investment  during  that   
week  is  generated  each  week over a 52-week  period  and  is  shown  as  a   
percentage. The yield reflects the deduction of all charges assessed  against   
the  Sub-Account and a Certificate but does not take into account  Contingent   
Deferred  Sales Charges and premium tax charges. The yield would be lower  if   
these charges were included.                                                    

The effective yield of the SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account is calculated  in   
a  similar manner but, when annualizing such yield, income earned by the Sub-   
Account is assumed to be reinvested. This compounding effect causes effective   
yield to be higher than yield.                                                  

KEYPORT AND THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT 

Keyport Life Insurance Company was incorporated in Rhode Island in 1957 as  a   
stock life insurance company. Its executive and administrative offices are at   
125  High  Street,  Boston, Massachusetts 02110. Its home office  is  at  235   
Promenade  Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903 and will  be  relocated  in   
May, 1997 to 695 George Washington Highway, Lincoln, Rhode Island 02865.        

Keyport  writes individual and group annuity contracts on a non-participating   
basis.  Keyport is licensed to do business in all states except New York  and   
is  also licensed in the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. Keyport   
has  been  rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best and Company, independent analysts   
of  the  insurance industry. Keyport has been rated A+ each year since  1976,   
the  first  year  Keyport  was subject to Best's  alphabetic  rating  system.   
Standard  &  Poor's  ("S & P") has rated Keyport AA- for excellent  financial   
security, Moody's has rated Keyport A1 for good financial strength and Duff &   
Phelps  has rated Keyport AA- for very high claims paying ability. The Best's   
A+  rating is in the highest rating category, which also includes A++. S &  P   
and  Duff  &  Phelps have one rating category above AA and  Moody's  has  two   
rating categories above A. The Moody's "1" modifier signifies that Keyport is   
in  the  higher  end of the A category while the S&P and Duff  &  Phelps  "-"   
modifier signifies that Keyport is at the lower end of the AA category. These   
ratings  merely reflect the opinion of the rating company as to the  relative   
financial  strength of Keyport and Keyport's ability to meet its  contractual   
obligations to its policyholders. Even though assets in the Variable  Account   
are held separately from Keyport's other assets, ratings of Keyport may still   
be  relevant  to  Certificate Owners since not all of  Keyport's  contractual   
obligations  relate to payments based on those segregated assets  (e.g.,  see   
"Death  Provisions" for Keyport's obligation after certain deaths to increase   
the  Certificate Value if it is less than Death Benefit Amount  or  otherwise   
enhance the death benefit with interest).                                       

Keyport  is  one  of the Liberty Financial Companies. Keyport  is  ultimately   
controlled  by  Liberty Mutual Insurance Company of Boston, Massachusetts,  a   
multi-line insurance company.                                                   

The Variable Account was established by Keyport pursuant to the provisions of   
Rhode  Island  Law  on  January  30, 1996. The  Variable  Account  meets  the   
definition  of  "separate  account" under the federal  securities  laws.  The   
Variable Account is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as   
a  unit  investment  trust under the Investment Company  Act  of  1940.  Such   
registration  does not involve supervision of the management of the  Variable   
Account or Keyport by the Securities and Exchange Commission.                   

Obligations  under the Certificates are the obligations of Keyport.  Although   
the  assets of the Variable Account are the property of Keyport, these assets   
are  held  separately from the other assets of Keyport and are not chargeable   
with  liabilities  arising  out of any other business  Keyport  may  conduct.   
Income,  capital gains and/or capital losses, whether or not  realized,  from   
assets  allocated to the Variable Account are credited to or charged  against   
the  Variable  Account  without regard to the income, capital  gains,  and/or   
capital  losses arising out of any other business Keyport may conduct.  Thus,   
Keyport  does  not  guarantee  the investment  performance  of  the  Variable   
Account.  The  Variable  Account Value and the  amount  of  variable  annuity   
payments will vary with the investment performance of the investments in  the   
Variable Account.                                                               

PURCHASE PAYMENTS AND APPLICATIONS    

The  initial  Purchase Payment is due on the Certificate  Date.  The  minimum   
initial Purchase Payment is $5,000. Additional Purchase Payments can be  made   
at  the Certificate Owner's option. Each subsequent Purchase Payment must  be   
at least $1,000 or such lesser amount as Keyport may permit from time to time   
(currently $250). Keyport may reject any Purchase Payment.                      

If  the  application  for a Certificate is in good order  and  it  calls  for   
amounts  to  be  allocated to the Variable Account, Keyport  will  apply  the   
initial  Purchase Payment to the Variable Account and credit the  Certificate   
with  Accumulation  Units  within  two  business  days  of  receipt.  If  the   
application for a Certificate is not in good order, Keyport will  attempt  to   
get  it in good order within five business days. If it is not complete at the   
end  of this period, Keyport will inform the applicant of the reason for  the   
delay  and that the Purchase Payment will be returned immediately unless  the   
applicant  specifically consents to Keyport's keeping  the  Purchase  Payment   
until  the  application is complete. Once the application  is  complete,  the   
Purchase  Payment will be applied within two business days of its completion.   
Keyport has reserved the right to reject any application.                       

Keyport confirms, in writing, to the Certificate Owner the allocation of  all   
Purchase  Payments  and  the  re-allocation of  values  after  any  requested   
transfer.  Keyport must be notified immediately by the Certificate  Owner  of   
any processing error.                                                           

Keyport  will  permit  others to act on behalf of  an  applicant  in  certain   
instances,  including the following two examples. First, Keyport will  accept   
an  application  for a Certificate that contains a signature signed  under  a   
power  of attorney if a copy of that power of attorney is submitted with  the   
application.  Second, Keyport will issue a Certificate that is  replacing  an   
existing  life insurance or annuity policy that was issued by either  Keyport   
or  an  affiliated  company  without  having  previously  received  a  signed   
application  from the applicant. Certain dealers or other authorized  persons   
such  as employers and Qualified Plan fiduciaries will inform Keyport  of  an   
applicant's  answers to the questions in the application by telephone  or  by   
order ticket and cause the initial Purchase Payment to be paid to Keyport. If   
the  information is in good order, Keyport will issue the Certificate with  a   
copy  of an application completed with that information. The Certificate will   
be  delivered to the Certificate Owner with a letter from Keyport  that  will   
give the Certificate Owner an opportunity to respond to Keyport if any of the   
application  information is incorrect. Alternatively,  Keyport's  letter  may   
request  the  Certificate Owner to confirm the correctness of the information   
by signing either a copy of the application or a Certificate delivery receipt   
that ratifies the application in all respects (in either case, a copy of  the   
signed document would be returned to Keyport for its permanent records).  All   
purchases  are confirmed, in writing, to the applicant by Keyport.  Keyport's   
liability under a Certificate extends only to amounts so confirmed.             

INVESTMENTS OF THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT   

Allocations of Purchase Payments    

Purchase Payments applied to the Variable Account will be invested in one  or   
more  of the Eligible Fund Sub-Accounts designated as permissible investments   
in  accordance  with  the  selection made by the  Certificate  Owner  in  the   
application.  Any  selection  must specify the  percentage  of  the  Purchase   
Payment  that  is  allocated to each Sub-Account or must  specify  the  asset   
allocation  model  selected.  (See  "Other  Services,  The  Programs".)   The   
percentage for each Sub-Account, if not zero, must be at least 5% and must be   
a  whole  number.  A Certificate Owner may change the allocation  percentages   
without  fee,  penalty or other charge. Allocation changes must  be  made  by   
Written   Request  unless  the  Certificate  Owner  has  by  Written  Request   
authorized  Keyport  to  accept telephone allocation  instructions  from  the   
Certificate  Owner or from a person acting for the Certificate  Owner  as  an   
attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney. By authorizing Keyport to  accept   
telephone changes, a Certificate Owner agrees to accept and be bound  by  the   
conditions  and  procedures established by Keyport from  time  to  time.  The   
current  conditions  and procedures are in Appendix B and Certificate  Owners   
authorizing  telephone allocation instructions will be notified, in  advance,   
of any changes.                                                                 

The  Variable  Account  is  segmented  into  Sub-Accounts.  Each  Sub-Account   
contains  the  shares  of  one of the Eligible  Funds  and  such  shares  are   
purchased at net asset value. Eligible Funds and Sub-accounts may be added or   
withdrawn  as  permitted by applicable law. The Sub-Accounts in the  Variable   
Account and the corresponding Eligible Funds currently are as follows:

There  is  no  assurance that the Eligible Funds will  achieve  their  stated   
objectives.                                                                     

All  the  Eligible Funds are funding vehicles for variable annuity  contracts   
and  variable life insurance policies offered by separate accounts of Keyport   
and  of  insurance  companies affiliated and unaffiliated with  Keyport.  The   
risks  involved  in  this "mixed and shared funding"  are  disclosed  in  the   
Eligible Fund prospectuses under the following captions: Alger American Fund-

Transfer of Variable Account Value    

Certificate  Owners may transfer Variable Account Value from one  Sub-Account   
to another Sub-Account and/or to the Fixed Account.                             

The  Certificate  allows Keyport to charge a transfer fee and  to  limit  the   
number  of transfers that can be made in a specified time period. Certificate   
Owners  should  be aware that transfer limitations may prevent a  Certificate   
Owner  from making a transfer on the date he or she wants to, with the result   
that  the Certificate Owner's future Certificate Value may be lower  than  it   
would have been had the transfer been made on the desired date.                 

Currently, Keyport has no limit on the number or frequency of transfers,  and   
it  is  not charging a transfer fee of $25 for each transfer in excess of  12   
per  Certificate  Year.  However, for transfers under different  Certificates   
that  are being requested under powers of attorney with a common attorney-in-   
fact or that are, in Keyport's determination, based on the recommendation  of   
a  common investment adviser or broker/dealer, there is a transfer limitation   
of  one  transfer every 30 days or such shorter time period  as  Keyport  may   
permit.                                                                         

Currently, Keyport is limiting each transfer to a maximum of $500,000 or such   
greater  amount  as  Keyport  may  permit.  All  transfers  requested  for  a   
Certificate  on  the same day will be treated as a single  transfer  and  the   
total combined transfer amount will be subject to the $500,000 limitation. If   
the  $500,000  limitation  is exceeded, no amount of  the  transfer  will  be   
executed by Keyport.                                                            

In  applying  the $500,000 limitation, Keyport may treat as one transfer  all   
transfers  requested by a Certificate Owner for multiple Certificates  he  or   
she  owns.  If  the  $500,000 limitation is exceeded for  multiple  transfers   
requested on the same day that are treated as a single transfer, no amount of   
the transfer will be executed by Keyport.                                       

In  applying  the  $500,000 limitation to transfers  requested  by  a  common   
attorney-in-fact or investment adviser, Keyport will treat  as  one  transfer   
all transfers requested under different Certificates that are being requested   
under  powers  of  attorney with a common attorney-in-fact or  that  are,  in   
Keyport's  determination, based on the recommendation of a common  investment   
adviser or broker/dealer. If the $500,000 limitation is exceeded for multiple   
transfers requested on the same day that are treated as a single transfer, no   
amount of the transfer will be executed by Keyport. If a transfer is executed   
under  one  Certificate and, within the next 30 days, a transfer request  for   
another  Certificate is determined by Keyport to be related to  the  executed   
transfer  under  this  paragraph's rules, the transfer request  will  not  be   
executed  by  Keyport. In order for it to be executed, it would  need  to  be   
requested  again after the 30 day period has expired and it, along  with  any   
other  transfer requests that are collectively treated as a single  transfer,   
would need to total less than $500,000.                                         

Keyport's  interest in applying these limitations is to protect the interests   
of  both  Certificate  Owners who are not engaging  in  significant  transfer   
activity  and  Certificate Owners who are engaging in such activity.  Keyport   
has determined that the actions of Certificate Owners engaging in significant   
transfer  activity  among Sub-Accounts may cause an  adverse  affect  on  the   
performance  of the Eligible Fund for the Sub-Account involved. The  movement   
of  Sub-Account  values  from  one Sub-Account to  another  may  prevent  the   
appropriate  Eligible Fund from taking advantage of investment  opportunities   
because  it  must maintain a liquid position in order to handle  redemptions.   
Such movement may also cause a substantial increase in Fund transaction costs   
which must be indirectly borne by Certificate Owners.                           

Certificate  Owners will be notified, in advance, of the  imposition  of  any   
transfer fee or of a change in the limitation on the number of transfers. The   
fee will not exceed the lesser of $25 and the cost of effecting a transfer.     

Transfers must be made by Written Request unless the Certificate Owner has by   
Written Request authorized Keyport to accept telephone transfer requests from   
the Certificate Owner or from a person acting for the Certificate Owner as an   
attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney. By authorizing Keyport to  accept   
telephone transfer instructions, a Certificate Owner agrees to accept and  be   
bound  by the conditions and procedures established by Keyport from  time  to   
time. The current conditions and procedures are in Appendix B and Certificate   
Owners  authorizing telephone transfers will be notified, in advance, of  any   
changes.  Written transfer requests may be made by a person  acting  for  the   
Certificate Owner as an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney.             

Transfer requests received by Keyport before the close of trading on the  New   
York Stock Exchange (currently 4:00 PM Eastern Time) will be initiated at the   
close of business that day. Any requests received later will be initiated  at   
the close of the next business day. Each request from a Certificate Owner  to   
transfer  value will be executed by both redeeming and acquiring Accumulation   
Units on the day Keyport initiates the transfer.                                

If  100% of any Sub-Account's value is transferred and the allocation formula   
for  Purchase Payments includes that Sub-Account, then the allocation formula   
for future Purchase Payments will automatically change unless the Certificate   
Owner  instructs otherwise. For example, if the allocation formula is 50%  to   
Sub-Account  A and 50% to Sub-Account B and all of Sub-Account A's  value  is   
transferred to Sub-Account B, the allocation formula will change to  100%  to   
Sub-Account B unless the Certificate Owner instructs otherwise.                 

Substitution of Eligible Funds and Other Variable Account Changes   

If  the shares of any of the Eligible Funds should no longer be available for   
investment  by  the  Variable  Account or if in  the  judgment  of  Keyport's   
management further investment in such fund shares should become inappropriate   
in  view  of  the purpose of the Certificate, Keyport may add  or  substitute   
shares  of another Eligible Fund or of another mutual fund for Eligible  Fund   
shares  already  purchased under the Certificate.  No  substitution  of  Fund   
shares  in  any  Sub-Account may take place without  prior  approval  of  the   
Securities and Exchange Commission and notice to Certificate Owners,  to  the   
extent required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                          

Keyport  has also reserved the right, subject to compliance with the  law  as   
currently  applicable  or subsequently changed: (a) to operate  the  Variable   
Account in any form permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or  in   
any  other form permitted by law; (b) to take any action necessary to  comply   
with or obtain and continue any exemptions from the Investment Company Act of   
1940  or to comply with any other applicable law; (c) to transfer any  assets   
in  any  Sub-Account  to  another Sub-Account, or to  one  or  more  separate   
investment  accounts, or to Keyport's general account; or to add, combine  or   
remove  Sub-Accounts  in the Variable Account; and  (d)  to  change  the  way   
Keyport  assesses charges, so long as the aggregate amount is  not  increased   
beyond that currently charged to the Variable Account and the Eligible  Funds   
in connection with the Certificates.                                            

DEDUCTIONS 

Deductions for Certificate Maintenance Charge   

Keyport has responsibility for all administration of the Certificates and the   
Variable  Account.  This  administration includes, but  is  not  limited  to,   
preparation of the Certificates, maintenance of Certificate Owners'  records,   
and all accounting, valuation, regulatory and reporting requirements. Keyport   
makes  a  Certificate  Maintenance  Charge  for  such  services  during   the   
accumulation and annuity payment periods. At the present time the Certificate   
Maintenance Charge is $36 per Certificate Year. PRIOR TO THE INCOME DATE  THE   
CERTIFICATE  MAINTENANCE  CHARGE IS NOT GUARANTEED  AND  MAY  BE  CHANGED  BY   
KEYPORT. The Certificate Maintenance Charge will be waived before the  Income   
Date if:                                                                        

(i)  it is the first Certificate Anniversary, or                                
(ii)  the  Certificate  Value is greater than or  equal  to  $40,000  on  the   
Certificate Anniversary date this charge is imposed, or                         
(iii)  Purchase  Payments of at least $2,000 have  been  made  in  the  prior   
Certificate  Year  and  there has been no partial  withdrawal  in  the  prior   
Certificate Year.                                                               

The  Certificate  Maintenance Charge will be waived on and after  the  Income   
Date for the current year if:                                                   

(i)  variable  annuity  Option A (Income for a  Fixed  Number  of  Years)  is   
applicable; and                                                                 
(ii)  at the time of the first payment of the year, the present value of  all   
of  the  remaining payments (see "Option A" on Page 21) is  greater  than  or   
equal to $40,000.                                                               

Prior to the Income Date, the full amount of the charge will be deducted from   
the Variable Account Value on each Certificate Anniversary and on the date of   
any total surrender not falling on the Certificate Anniversary. On the Income   
Date,  a  pro-rata  portion  of  the  charge  due  on  the  next  Certificate   
Anniversary  will be deducted from the Variable Account Value. This  pro-rata   
charge covers the period from the prior Certificate Anniversary to the Income   
Date.  For  example,  if  the Income Date occurs 73  days  after  that  prior   
anniversary,  then  one-fifth (i.e., 73 days/365 days) of the  annual  charge   
would  be deducted on the Income Date. The charge will be deducted from  each   
Sub-Account  in the proportion that the value of each bears to  the  Variable   
Account Value.                                                                  

Once  annuity  payments  begin on the Income Date or once  they  begin  after   
surrender benefits are applied under a settlement option, the yearly cost  of   
the Certificate Maintenance Charge for a payee's annuity will be the same  as   
the  yearly  amount in effect immediately before the annuity payments  begin.   
Keyport may not later change the amount of the Certificate Maintenance Charge   
deducted from the annuity payments. The charge will be deducted on a pro-rata   
basis  from  each  annuity  payment. For example,  if  annuity  payments  are   
monthly,  then  one-twelfth of the annual charge will be deducted  from  each   
payment.                                                                        

Deductions for Mortality and Expense Risk Charge    

Although variable annuity payments made to Annuitants will vary in accordance   
with  the  investment performance of the investments of the Variable Account,   
they will not be affected by the mortality experience (death rate) of persons   
receiving such payments or of the general population. Keyport guarantees  the   
Death  Benefits described below (see "Death Provisions"). Keyport assumes  an   
expense  risk since the Certificate Maintenance Charge after the Income  Date   
will stay the same and not be affected by variations in expenses.               

To compensate it for assuming mortality and expense risks, for each Valuation   
Period  Keyport  deducts from each Sub-Account a Mortality and  Expense  Risk   
Charge equal on an annual basis to 1.25% of the average daily net asset value   
of  the Sub-Account. The charge is deducted during both the accumulation  and   
annuity periods (i.e., both before and after the Income Date). Less than  the   
full  charge  will  be  deducted  from  Sub-Account  values  attributable  to   
Certificates  issued to employees of Keyport and other persons  specified  in   
"Sales of the Certificates".                                                    

Deductions for Daily Distribution Charge    

Keyport  also  deducts from each Sub-Account each Valuation  Period  a  daily   
Distribution  Charge equal on an annual basis to 0.15% of the  average  daily   
net  asset  value  of  the Sub-Account. This charge compensates  Keyport  for   
certain sales distribution expenses relating to the Certificate.                

This  charge  will  not be deducted from Sub-Account values  attributable  to   
Certificates  that  have reached the maximum cumulative  distribution  charge   
limit  defined below and to Certificates issued to employees of  Keyport  and   
other  persons specified in "Sales of the Certificates". The charge  is  also   
not  deducted from Sub-Account values attributable to Annuity Units.  Keyport   
may decide not to deduct the charge from Sub-Account values attributable to a   
Certificate issued in an internal exchange or transfer of an annuity contract   
of Keyport's general account.                                                   

Deductions for Contingent Deferred Sales Charge   

A  sales charge is not deducted from the Certificate's Purchase Payments when   
initially  received.  However,  a Contingent Deferred  Sales  Charge  may  be   
deducted upon a surrender.                                                      

In  order to determine whether a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be due   
upon  a  partial  or  total surrender, Keyport maintains a  separate  set  of   
records. These records identify the date and amount of each Purchase  Payment   
made to the Certificate and the Certificate Value over time.                    

Certificate  Owners will be permitted to make partial surrenders  during  the   
Accumulation Period without incurring a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge,  as   
follows:                                                                        

  1. In any Certificate Year, Certificate Owners may withdraw an aggregate
amount  not  to  exceed,  at  the time of the withdrawal,  the  Certificate's   
earnings, which equal: (a) the Certificate Value, less (b) the portion of the   
Purchase Payments not previously withdrawn.                                     

   2.  In  any  Certificate Year after the first, Certificate  Owners  may
withdraw, in addition to the amount available in 1., the amount by which  10%   
of  the Certificate Value as of the preceding Certificate Anniversary exceeds   
the amount available in 1.                                                      

Contingent Deferred Sales Charges, as discussed below, will be deducted  with   
respect to withdrawals in excess of these amounts.                              

In  computing  the applicable charge amounts, the amount of any surrender  in   
any  Certificate  Year  after the first as set forth in  2.  above,  will  be   
deducted from the Purchase Payments in chronological order from the oldest to   
the  most  recent until the amount is fully deducted. Any amount so  deducted   
will not be subject to a charge.                                                

The  following additional amounts will be deducted from the Purchase Payments   
in  the  same chronological order: the amount of any surrender in  the  first   
Certificate Year in excess of the amount set forth in 1. above and the amount   
of  any  surrender in any later Certificate Year in excess  of  the  combined   
amount set forth in 1. and 2. above. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge for   
each  Purchase Payment from which a deduction is made will be  equal  to  (a)   
multiplied by (b), where:                                                       

(a)  is the amount so deducted; and                                             

(b)   is  the applicable percentage for the number of years that have elapsed   
from  the  date of that payment to the date of surrender. Years are  measured   
from  the  month  and  day  of payment to the same  month  and  day  in  each   
subsequent calendar year. The percentages applicable to each Purchase Payment   
during  the seven years after the date of its payment are: 7% during year  1;   
6%  during year 2; 5% during year 3; 4% during year 4; 3% during year  5;  2%   
during year 6; 1% during year 7; and 0% thereafter.                             

The  applicable  Contingent Deferred Sales Charges for each Purchase  Payment   
are  then  totaled.  The  lesser of this total amount and  the  Certificate's   
maximum  cumulative distribution charge will be deducted from the Certificate   
Value  in  the  same  manner as the surrender amount. The maximum  cumulative   
distribution  charge is equal to (a) less (b), where (a) is 9% of  the  total   
Purchase  Payments made to the Certificate and (b) is the sum  of  all  prior   
Contingent Deferred Sale Charge deductions from the Certificate Value and all   
prior   Variable  Account  daily  distribution  charges  applicable  to   the   
Certificate from the 0.15% distribution charge factor. After each  surrender,   
Keyport's  records will be adjusted to reflect any deductions made  from  the   
applicable Purchase Payments.                                                   

Example:  Two  Purchase  Payments were made one year  apart  for  $5,000  and   
$7,000.  The  Certificate  Value has grown to an  assumed  $13,200  when  the   
Certificate  Owner decides to withdraw $8,000. The Certificate Value  at  the   
beginning  of  the Certificate Year of surrender was $13,000. The  Contingent   
Deferred Sales Charge percentages at the time of surrender are an assumed  5%   
for  the  $5,000  payment and 6% for the $7,000 payment. The portion  of  the   
surrender  representing the Certificate's earnings ($13,200 less $12,000,  or   
$1,200) would not be subject to charges. Since $1,200 is less than the amount   
guaranteed  not  to have charges (10% of $13,000, or $1,300),  an  additional   
$100  would not be subject to charges. This $100 would be deducted  from  the   
oldest  Purchase  Payment,  reducing it from $5,000  to  $4,900.  The  $1,200   
increase  in value plus the additional $100 leaves $6,700 ($8,000 -  1,200  -   
100)  to  be deducted. This $6,700 would be deducted from the $4,900  of  the   
first  payment  still  left  and  $1,800 of the  second  payment.  The  total   
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge would be $4,900 multiplied by the applicable   
5%  and  $1,800 times the applicable 6%, or a total of $353. The distribution   
charge  records would now reflect $0 for the 1st payment and $5,200  for  the   
2nd payment. The $8,000 requested plus the $353 charge would be deducted from   
Certificate  Values  under  the rules specified in "Partial  Withdrawals  and
Surrender" on Page 20.                                                          

The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, when it is applicable, will be used  to   
cover the expenses of selling the Certificate, including compensation paid to   
selling dealers and the cost of sales literature. Any expenses not covered by   
the  charge  will be paid from Keyport's general account, which  may  include   
monies deducted from the Variable Account for the Mortality and Expense  Risk   
Charge.  A dealer selling the Certificate may receive up to 6.00% of Purchase   
Payments with additional compensation later based on the Certificate Value of   
those payments. During certain time periods selected by Keyport and KFSC, the   
percentage may increase to 6.25%.                                               

The  Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be waived in the event  a  Covered   
Person  is  confined in a medical facility in accordance with the  provisions   
and conditions of an endorsement relating to such confinements.                 

The  Contingent  Deferred Sales Charge will be eliminated under  Certificates   
issued  to employees of Keyport and other persons specified in "Sales of  the
Certificates".                                                                  

Keyport  may  reduce  or  change to 0% any Contingent Deferred  Sales  Charge   
percentage under a Certificate issued in an internal exchange or transfer  of   
an annuity contract of Keyport's general account.                               

Keyport  may  allow, under the Systematic Withdrawal Program and under  other   
permitted  circumstances, all or part of the amount in 2. above  to  also  be   
available in the first Certificate Year.  If so, the amount in 2. above  will   
be   calculated  by  substituting  the  initial  Purchase  Payment  for   the   
Certificate Value.                                                              

Deductions for Transfers of Variable Account Value    

The Certificate allows Keyport to charge a transfer fee. Currently no fee  is   
being  charged.  Certificate  Owners will be notified,  in  advance,  of  the   
imposition of any fee. The fee will not exceed the lesser of $25 and the cost   
of effecting a transfer.                                                        

Deductions for Premium Taxes    

Keyport  deducts  the  amount of any premium taxes levied  by  any  state  or   
governmental entity when paid unless Keyport elects to defer such  deduction.   
It is not possible to describe precisely the amount of premium tax payable on   
any  transaction involving the Certificate offered hereby. Such premium taxes   
depend,  among  other things, on the type of Certificate (Qualified  or  Non-   
Qualified), on the state of residence of the Certificate Owner, the state  of   
residence of the Annuitant, the status of Keyport within such states, and the   
insurance tax laws of such states. Currently such premium taxes range from 0%   
to 5.0% of either total Purchase Payments or Certificate Value.                 

Deductions for Income Taxes   

Keyport will deduct from any amount payable under the Certificate any  income   
taxes that a governmental authority requires Keyport to withhold with respect   
to that amount. See "Income Tax Withholding" and "Tax-Sheltered Annuities".     

Total Variable Account Expenses   

Total  Variable Account expenses in relation to the Certificate will  be  the   
Certificate  Maintenance Charge, the Mortality and Expense Risk  Charge,  and   
the Daily Sales Charge.                                                         

The  value  of the assets in the Variable Account will reflect the  value  of   
Eligible Fund shares and therefore the deductions from and expenses paid  out   
of  the  assets  of  the Eligible Funds. These deductions  and  expenses  are   
described in the Eligible Fund prospectuses.                                    

OTHER SERVICES    

The  Programs. Keyport offers several investment related programs  which  are   
available  only  prior  to  the Income Date: Asset  Allocation;  Dollar  Cost   
Averaging;  Systematic  Investment;  and Systematic  Withdrawal  Programs.  A   
Rebalancing  Program is available prior to and after the Income  Date.  Under   
each  Program, the related transfers between and among Sub-Accounts  and  the   
Fixed  Account are not counted as one of the twelve free transfers.  Each  of   
the  Programs has its own requirements, as discussed below. Keyport  reserves   
the right to terminate any Program.                                             

If  the  Certificate Owner has submitted the required telephone authorization   
form,  certain changes may be made by telephone. For those Programs involving   
transfers, Owners may change instructions by telephone with regard  to  which   
Sub-Accounts  or the Fixed Account Certificate Value may be transferred.  The   
current conditions and procedures are described in Appendix B.                  

Dollar Cost Averaging Program. Keyport offers a Dollar Cost Averaging Program   
that  Certificate Owners may participate in by Written Request.  The  program   
periodically transfers Accumulation Units from the SteinRoe Cash Income  Sub-   
Account  or the One-Year Guarantee Period of the Fixed Account to other  Sub-   
Accounts  selected by the Certificate Owner. The program allows a Certificate   
Owner  to  invest in Variable Sub-Accounts over time rather  than  having  to   
invest  in  those  Sub-Accounts all at once. The  program  is  available  for   
initial   and   subsequent  Purchase  Payments  and  for  Certificate   Value   
transferred  into  the  SteinRoe  Cash Income  Sub-Account  or  the  One-Year   
Guarantee Period. Under the program, Keyport makes automatic transfers  on  a   
periodic  basis out of the SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account or  the  One-Year   
Guarantee  Period  into  one  or  more of the  other  available  Sub-Accounts   
(Keyport  reserves  the  right  to  limit  the  number  of  Sub-Accounts  the   
Certificate Owner may choose but there are currently no limits).                

The  Certificate  Owner  by Written Request must specify  the  SteinRoe  Cash   
Income  Sub-Account or the One Year Guarantee Period from which the transfers   
are  to be made, the monthly amount to be transferred (minimum $100) and  the   
Sub-Account(s) to which the transfers are to be made. The first transfer will   
occur  at the close of the Valuation Period that includes the 30th day  after   
the  receipt  of  the  Certificate Owner's Written Request.  Each  succeeding   
transfer will occur one month later (e.g., if the 30th day after the  receipt   
date is April 8, the second transfer will occur at the close of the Valuation   
Period  that  includes  May 8). When the remaining value  is  less  than  the   
monthly  transfer  amount, that remaining value will be transferred  and  the   
program  will  end.  Before this final transfer, the  Certificate  Owner  may   
extend the program by allocating additional Purchase Payments to the SteinRoe   
Cash  Income  Sub-Account or the One Year Guarantee Period or by transferring   
Certificate  Value to the SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account or  the  One  Year   
Guarantee  Period.  The  Certificate Owner may,  by  Written  Request  or  by   
telephone,  change  the  monthly amount to be transferred,  change  the  Sub-   
Account(s)  to  which the transfers are to be made, or end the  program.  The   
program  will  automatically end if the Income Date occurs. Keyport  reserves   
the  right to end the program at any time by sending the Certificate Owner  a   
notice one month in advance.                                                    

Written  or  telephone instructions must be received by Keyport  by  the  end   
(currently  4:00  PM  Eastern Time) of the business day  preceding  the  next   
scheduled  transfer  in  order to be in effect for that  transfer.  Telephone   
instructions  are  subject  to the conditions and procedures  established  by   
Keyport  from time to time. The current conditions and procedures  appear  in   
Appendix B, and Certificate Owners in a dollar cost averaging program will be   
notified, in advance, of any changes.                                           

Asset  Allocation  Program. Certificate Owners may  select  from  five  asset   
allocation  model portfolios developed by Ibbotoson Associates  (Model  A  --   
Capital  Preservation,  Model B -- Income and Growth,  Model  C  --  Moderate   
Growth,  Model  D  --  Growth,  and Model  E  --  Aggressive  Growth).  If  a   
Certificate  Owner elects one of the models, initial and subsequent  Purchase   
Payments will automatically be allocated among the Sub-Accounts in the model.   
Only one model may be used in a Certificate at a time. Certificate Owners may   
use  a  questionnaire  and  scoring  system  to  determine  the  model  which   
corresponds to their risk tolerance and time horizons.                          

Periodically  Ibbotoson Associates will review the models and  may  determine   
that  a reconfiguration of the Sub-Accounts and percentage allocations  among   
those   Sub-Accounts   is  appropriate.  Certificate  Owners   will   receive   
notification prior to any reconfiguration.                                      

The  Fixed  Account  is  not  available in  any  asset  allocation  model.  A   
Certificate  Owner may allocate initial or subsequent Purchase  Payments,  or   
Certificate Value, between an asset allocation model and the Fixed Account.     

Rebalancing  Program. In accordance with the Certificate Owner's election  of   
the   relative   Purchase  Payment  percentage  allocations,   Keyport   will   
automatically rebalance the Certificate Value of each Sub-Account  quarterly.   
On the last day of the calendar quarter, Keyport will automatically rebalance   
the  Certificate  Value  in each of the Sub-Accounts  to  match  the  current   
Purchase Payment percentage allocations. The Program may be terminated at any   
time  and  the  percentages may be altered by Written Request. The  requested   
change  must be received at the Office ten (10) days prior to the end of  the   
calendar  quarter. Certificate Value allocated to the Fixed  Account  is  not   
subject   to   automatic  rebalancing.  After  the  Income  Date,   automatic   
rebalancing  applies  only  to variable annuity  payments  and  Keyport  will   
rebalance the number of Annuity Units in each Sub-Account (Annuity Units  are   
used  to  calculate  the  amount  of each Sub-Account  annuity  payment;  see   
"Variable Annuity Benefits" in the Statement of Additional Information).        

Systematic Investment Program. Purchase Payments may be made by monthly draft   
against  the  bank  account of any Certificate Owner who  has  completed  and   
returned   to  Keyport  a  Systematic  Investment  Program  application   and   
authorization  form. The application and authorization form may  be  obtained   
from  Keyport  or  from the sales representative. Each Systematic  Investment   
Program  Purchase  Payment is subject to a minimum of  $250  or  such  lesser   
amount as Keyport may permit.                                                   

Systematic  Withdrawal Program. To the extent permitted by law, Keyport  will   
make   monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annually  or  annual  distributions  of   a   
predetermined dollar amount to the Certificate Owner that has enrolled in the   
Systematic Withdrawal Program. Under the Program, all distributions  will  be   
made  directly to the Certificate Owner and will be treated for  federal  tax   
purposes  as any other withdrawal or distribution of Certificate Value.  (See   
"Tax  Status".) The Certificate Owner may specify the amount of each  partial   
withdrawal, subject to a minimum of $100. Systematic withdrawals may be  made   
from  any  Sub-Account  or Guarantee Period of the  Fixed  Account.  In  each   
Certificate Year, portions of Certificate Value may be withdrawn without  the   
imposition   of  any  Contingent  Deferred  Sales  Charge  ("Free  Withdrawal   
Amount").  If withdrawals pursuant to the Program are greater than  the  Free   
Withdrawal  Amount,  the  amount of the withdrawals  greater  than  the  Free   
Withdrawal Amount will be subject to the applicable Contingent Deferred Sales   
Charge. Any unrelated voluntary partial withdrawal a Certificate Owner  makes   
during a Certificate Year will be aggregated with withdrawals pursuant to the   
Program  to  determine  the  applicability of any Contingent  Deferred  Sales   
Charge under the Certificate provisions regarding partial withdrawals.          

Unless the Certificate Owner specifies the Sub-Account or Sub-Accounts or the   
Fixed Account from which withdrawals of Certificate Value shall be made or if   
the  amount in a specified Sub-Account is less than the predetermined amount,   
Keyport  will make withdrawals under the Program in the manner specified  for   
partial  withdrawals in "Partial Withdrawals and Surrender". All  Sub-Account   
withdrawals  under the Program will be effected by canceling  the  number  of   
Accumulation  Units  equal in value to the amount to be  distributed  to  the   
Certificate Owner and any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.          

The  Program  may be combined with all other Programs except  the  Systematic   
Investment Program.                                                             

It  may  not be advisable to participate in the Systematic Withdrawal Program   
and  incur a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge when making additional Purchase   
Payments under the Certificate.                                                 

THE CERTIFICATES 

Variable Account Value    

The  Variable Account Value for a Certificate is the sum of the value of each   
Sub-Account to which values are allocated under a Certificate. The  value  of   
each  Sub-Account  is  determined at any time by multiplying  the  number  of   
Accumulation Units attributable to that Sub-Account by the Accumulation  Unit   
value  for  that  Sub-Account at the time of determination. The  Accumulation   
Unit  value is an accounting unit of measure used to determine the change  in   
an Accumulation Unit's value from Valuation Period to Valuation Period.         

Each  Purchase Payment that is made results in additional Accumulation  Units   
being credited to the Certificate and the appropriate Sub-Account thereunder.   
The  number  of  additional units for any Sub-Account will equal  the  amount   
allocated to that Sub-Account divided by the Accumulation Unit value for that   
Sub-Account at the time of investment.                                          

Valuation Periods   

The  Variable  Account is valued each Valuation Period using  the  net  asset   
value  of  the  Eligible  Fund  shares. A  Valuation  Period  is  the  period   
commencing  at  the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange  on  each   
Valuation  Date  and ending at the close of trading for the  next  succeeding   
Valuation Date. A Valuation Date is each day that the New York Stock Exchange   
is  open  for  business. The New York Stock Exchange is currently  closed  on   
weekends,  New  Year's  Day,  Presidents' Day,  Good  Friday,  Memorial  Day,   
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.                

Net Investment Factor   

Variable  Account  Value  will fluctuate in accordance  with  the  investment   
results  of  the underlying Eligible Funds. In order to determine  how  these   
fluctuations affect value, Keyport utilizes an Accumulation Unit value.  Each   
Sub-account has its own Accumulation Units and value per Unit. The Unit value   
applicable  during  any Valuation Period is determined at  the  end  of  that   
period.                                                                         

When  Keyport first purchased Eligible Fund shares on behalf of the  Variable   
Account, Keyport valued each Accumulation Unit at a specified dollar  amount.   
The  Unit  value for each Sub-Account in any Valuation Period  thereafter  is   
determined  by multiplying the value for the prior period by a net investment   
factor.  This  factor  may  be  greater or  less  than  1.0;  therefore,  the   
Accumulation Unit may increase or decrease from Valuation Period to Valuation   
Period.  Keyport calculates a net investment factor for each  Sub-Account  by   
dividing (a) by (b) and then subtracting (c) (i.e., (a/b) - c), where:          

(a) is equal to:                                                                

(i)  the  net asset value per share of the Eligible Fund at the  end  of  the   
Valuation Period; plus                                                          

(ii)  the per share amount of any distribution made by the Eligible  Fund  if   
the "ex-dividend" date occurs during that same Valuation Period.                

(b)  is the net asset value per share of the Eligible Fund at the end of  the   
prior Valuation Period.                                                         

(c) is equal to:                                                                

(i) the Valuation Period equivalent of the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge;   
plus                                                                            

(ii) the Valuation Period equivalent of the daily Distribution Charge; plus     

(iii)  a  charge factor, if any, for any tax provision established by Keyport   
as a result of the operations of that Sub-Account.                              

If  a  Certificate  ever reaches the maximum cumulative  sales  charge  limit   
defined  in  "Deductions for Contingent Deferred Sales Charge",  Unit  values   
without  (c)(ii)  above will be used thereafter. For Certificates  issued  to   
employees  of  Keyport  and  other  persons  specified  in  "Sales   of   the
Certificates",  Unit  values with .35% in (c)(i) above  and  without  (c)(ii)   
above will be used. Unit values without (c)(ii) above may be used for certain   
Certificates issued in an internal exchange or transfer (see "Deductions  for
Daily Distribution Charge").                                                    

Modification of the Certificate   

Only  Keyport's President or Secretary may agree to alter the Certificate  or   
waive  any  of  its terms. Any changes must be made in writing and  with  the   
Certificate Owner's consent, except as may be required by applicable law.       

Right to Revoke   

The  Certificate Owner may return the Certificate within 10 days after he  or   
she  receives it by delivering or mailing it to Keyport's Office. The  return   
of  the Certificate by mail will be effective when the postmark is affixed to   
a  properly  addressed and postage-prepaid envelope. The returned Certificate   
will  be treated as if Keyport never issued it and Keyport will refund either   
the Certificate Value or Purchase Payments, as required by state law.           

For  Certificates delivered in California to a Certificate Owner  age  60  or   
older,  the Certificate Owner may return the Certificate to Keyport's  Office   
or  to  the agent from whom the Certificate was purchased. If the Certificate   
is  received  at  Keyport's Office or by the agent within 30 days  after  the   
Certificate  Owner  receives  the  Certificate,  Keyport  will   refund   the   
Certificate Value.                                                              

DEATH PROVISIONS FOR NON-QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES 

Death  of  Primary  Owner, Joint Owner or Certain Non-Owner Annuitant.  These   
provisions  apply  if,  before the Income Date while the  Certificate  is  In   
Force,  the  primary  Certificate Owner or any Joint Certificate  Owner  dies   
(whether  or  not the decedent is also the Annuitant) or the  Annuitant  dies   
under a Certificate with a non-natural Certificate Owner such as a trust. The   
Designated Beneficiary will control the Certificate after such a death.         

If   the  decedent's  surviving  spouse  (if  any)  is  the  sole  Designated   
Beneficiary,  the  surviving spouse will automatically become  the  new  sole   
primary  Certificate Owner as of the decedent's date of death.  And,  if  the   
Annuitant  is  the decedent, the new Annuitant will be any living  contingent   
annuitant, otherwise the surviving spouse. The Certificate may continue until   
another  death  occurs  (i.e.,  until the death  of  the  Annuitant,  primary   
Certificate Owner or joint Certificate Owner). Except for this paragraph, all   
of "Death Provisions" will apply to that subsequent death.                      

In  all  other cases, the Certificate may continue up to five years from  the   
date  of  death. During this period, the Designated Beneficiary may  exercise   
all  ownership  rights,  including the right to  make  transfers  or  partial   
surrenders  or  the  right  to  totally surrender  the  Certificate  for  its   
Surrender Value. If the Certificate is still in effect at the end of the five-  
year period, Keyport will automatically end it then by paying the Certificate   
Value  to  the Designated Beneficiary. If the Designated Beneficiary  is  not   
then   alive,  Keyport  will  pay  any  person(s)  named  by  the  Designated   
Beneficiary  in  a  Written  Request; otherwise the Designated  Beneficiary's   
estate.                                                                         

The Covered Person under this paragraph shall be the decedent if he or she is   
the  first to die of the primary Certificate Owner, Joint Certificate  Owner,   
Annuitant, or, if there is a non-natural Certificate Owner such as  a  trust,   
the  Annuitant shall be the Covered Person. If the Covered Person  dies,  the   
Certificate  Value will be increased, as provided below, if it is  less  than   
the Death Benefit Amount ("DBA"). The DBA is:                                   

The  DBA  at  issue is the initial Purchase Payment. Thereafter, the  DBA  is   
calculated  for  each  Valuation  period by adding  any  additional  Purchase   
Payments,  and  deducting any partial withdrawals, including  any  applicable   
surrender  charge. This resulting amount is the "net Purchase  Payment  death   
benefit".  The  Certificate  Value  for  each  Certificate  Anniversary  (the   
"Anniversary  Value")  before the 81st birthday  of  the  Covered  Person  is   
determined. Each Anniversary Value is increased by any Purchase Payments made   
after  that anniversary. This resultant value is then decreased by an  amount   
calculated at the time of any partial withdrawal made after that anniversary.   
The  amount is calculated by taking the amount of any partial withdrawal, and   
dividing   by  the  Certificate  Value  immediately  preceding  the   partial   
withdrawal,  and  then  multiplying  by  the  Anniversary  Value  immediately   
preceding  the  withdrawal. The greatest Anniversary Value, as  so  adjusted,   
(the "greatest Anniversary Value") is the DBA unless the net Purchase Payment   
death  benefit is higher. The net Purchase Payment death benefit will be  the   
DBA if such amount is higher than the greatest Anniversary Value.               

When  Keyport receives due proof of the Covered Person's death, Keyport  will   
compare,  as of the date of death, the Certificate Value to the DBA.  If  the   
Certificate  Value was less than the DBA, Keyport will increase  the  current   
Certificate Value by the amount of the difference. Note that while the amount   
of  the difference is determined as of the date of death, that amount is  not   
added to the Certificate Value until Keyport receives due proof of death. The   
amount  to  be credited will be allocated to the Variable Account and/or  the   
Fixed  Account based on the Purchase Payment allocation selection that is  in   
effect  when  Keyport  receives  due proof  of  death.  Whether  or  not  the   
Certificate  Value is increased because of this minimum death provision,  the   
Designated  Beneficiary may, by the later of the 90th day after  the  Covered   
Person's  death  and  the 60th day after Keyport is notified  of  the  death,   
surrender  the Certificate for the Certificate Withdrawal Value  without  any   
applicable  Contingent Deferred Sales Charge being deducted. For a  surrender   
after  the  applicable 90 or 60 day period and for a surrender  at  any  time   
after  the death of a non-Covered Person, any applicable Contingent  Deferred   
Sales  Charge  would be deducted. If the Certificate is not  surrendered,  it   
will continue for the time period specified above.                              

Payment  of Benefits. Instead of receiving a lump sum, the Certificate  Owner   
or  any Designated Beneficiary may direct by Written Request that Keyport pay   
any  benefit of $5,000 or more under an annuity payment option that meets the   
following: (a) the first payment to the Designated Beneficiary must  be  made   
no  later  than one year after the date of death; (b) payments must  be  made   
over  the  life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period not  extending   
beyond  that  person's  life  expectancy; and (c)  any  payment  option  that   
provides  for  payments  to  continue  after  the  death  of  the  Designated   
Beneficiary will not allow the successor payee to extend the period  of  time   
over which the remaining payments are to be made.                               

Death of Certain Non-Certificate Owner Annuitant. These provisions apply  if,   
before  the Income Date while the Certificate is In Force, (a) the  Annuitant   
dies,  (b)  the Annuitant is not a Certificate Owner, and (c) the Certificate   
Owner  is  a  natural  person.  The  Certificate  will  continue  after   the   
Annuitant's death. The new Annuitant will be any living contingent annuitant,   
otherwise the primary Certificate Owner. If the Annuitant is the first to die   
of  the Certificate's primary Certificate Owner, Joint Certificate Owner  and   
Annuitant, then the Annuitant is the Covered Person and the Certificate Value   
will  be  increased, as provided below, if it is less than the Death  Benefit   
Amount  ("DBA"),  as defined above. When Keyport receives due  proof  of  the   
Annuitant's  death,  Keyport will compare, as  of  the  date  of  death,  the   
Certificate Value to the DBA. If the Certificate Value was less than the DBA,   
Keyport  will  increase the current Certificate Value by the  amount  of  the   
difference. Note that while the amount of the difference is determined as  of   
the  date  of death, that amount is not added to the Certificate Value  until   
Keyport  receives  due  proof of death. The amount to  be  credited  will  be   
allocated  to  the  Variable Account and/or the Fixed Account  based  on  the   
Purchase Payment allocation selection that is in effect when Keyport receives   
due proof of death. Whether or not the Certificate Value is increased because   
of  this  minimum  death provision, the Certificate Owner may  surrender  the   
Certificate  within  90  days of the date of the Annuitant's  death  for  the   
Certificate Withdrawal Value without any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales   
Charge  being  deducted.  For  a  surrender after  90  days,  any  applicable   
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge would be deducted.                             

DEATH PROVISIONS FOR QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES   

Death  of  Annuitant. If the Annuitant dies before the Income Date while  the   
Certificate  is  In  Force,  the  Designated  Beneficiary  will  control  the   
Certificate  after such a death. The Certificate Value will be increased,  as   
provided  below,  if  it  is less than the Death Benefit  Amount  ("DBA")  as   
defined  above.  When  Keyport receives due proof of the  Annuitant's  death,   
Keyport will compare, as of the date of death, the Certificate Value  to  the   
DBA.  If  the Certificate Value was less than the DBA, Keyport will  increase   
the  current  Certificate Value by the amount of the  difference.  Note  that   
while  the  amount of the difference is determined as of the date  of  death,   
that amount is not added to the Certificate Value until Keyport receives  due   
proof  of  death. The amount to be credited will be allocated to the Variable   
Account  and/or  the  Fixed Account based on the Purchase Payment  allocation   
selection that is in effect when Keyport receives due proof of death. Whether   
or  not  the  Certificate Value is increased because of  this  minimum  death   
provision, the Designated Beneficiary may, by the later of the 90th day after   
the  Annuitant's  death and the 60th day after Keyport  is  notified  of  the   
death, surrender the Certificate for the Certificate Withdrawal Value without   
any  applicable  Contingent  Deferred Sales  Charge  being  deducted.  For  a   
surrender after the applicable 90 or 60 day period, any applicable Contingent   
Deferred Sales Charge would be deducted.                                        

If  the  Certificate is not surrendered, it may continue for the time  period   
permitted  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  provisions  applicable  to   the   
particular Qualified Plan. During this period, the Designated Beneficiary may   
exercise  all  ownership rights, including the right  to  make  transfers  or   
partial withdrawals or the right to totally surrender the Certificate for its   
Certificate  Withdrawal Value. If the Certificate is still in effect  at  the   
end  of  the  period, Keyport will automatically end it then  by  paying  the   
Certificate  Withdrawal  Value  (without  the  deduction  of  any  applicable   
Contingent  Deferred  Sales  Charge) to the Designated  Beneficiary.  If  the   
Designated  Beneficiary  is not alive then, Keyport will  pay  any  person(s)   
named  by  the  Designated Beneficiary in a Written  Request;  otherwise  the   
Designated Beneficiary's estate.                                                

Payment  of Benefits. Instead of receiving a lump sum, the Certificate  Owner   
or  any Designated Beneficiary may direct by Written Request that Keyport pay   
any  benefit of $5,000 or more under an annuity payment option that meets the   
following: (a) the first payment to the Designated Beneficiary must  be  made   
no  later  than one year after the date of death; (b) payments must  be  made   
over  the  life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period not  extending   
beyond  that  person's  life  expectancy; and (c)  any  payment  option  that   
provides  for  payments  to  continue  after  the  death  of  the  Designated   
Beneficiary will not allow the successor payee to extend the period  of  time   
over which the remaining payments are to be made.                               

CERTIFICATE OWNERSHIP   

The  Certificate Owner shall be the person designated in the application. The   
Certificate  Owner  may  exercise all the rights of  the  Certificate.  Joint   
Certificate Owners are permitted but not contingent Certificate Owners.         

The  Certificate  Owner may by Written Request change the Certificate  Owner,   
primary  beneficiary,  contingent beneficiary  or  contingent  annuitant.  An   
irrevocably-named person may be changed only with the written consent of such   
person.                                                                         

Because  a  change of Certificate Owner by means of a gift (i.e., a  transfer   
without  full  and  adequate  consideration)  may  be  a  taxable  event,   a   
Certificate  Owner  should consult a competent tax  adviser  as  to  the  tax   
consequences resulting from such a transfer.                                    

Any  Qualified Certificate may have limitations on transfer of  ownership.  A   
Certificate  Owner should consult the Plan Administrator and a competent  tax   
adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer.              

ASSIGNMENT    

The  Certificate Owner may assign the Certificate at any time. A copy of  any   
assignment  must  be filed with Keyport. The Certificate Owner's  rights  and   
those  of  any revocably-named person will be subject to the assignment.  Any   
Qualified Certificate may have limitations on assignability.                    

Because  an  assignment  may be a taxable event, a Certificate  Owner  should   
consult a competent tax adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from any   
such assignment.                                                                

PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS AND SURRENDER 

The  Certificate  Owner  may make partial withdrawals from  the  Certificate.   
Keyport must receive a Written Request and the minimum amount to be withdrawn   
must  be  at  least  $300  or such lesser amount as  Keyport  may  permit  in   
conjunction  with  a Systematic Withdrawal Program. If the Certificate  Value   
after  a  partial withdrawal would be below $2,500, Keyport  will  treat  the   
request  as  a withdrawal of only the excess amount over $2,500.  The  amount   
withdrawn  will include any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales  Charge  and   
therefore the amount actually withdrawn may be greater than the amount of the   
surrender check requested. Unless the request specifies otherwise, the  total   
amount  withdrawn  will  be deducted from all Sub-Accounts  of  the  Variable   
Account  in the ratio that the value in each Sub-Account bears to  the  total   
Variable Account Value. If there is no value, or insufficient value,  in  the   
Variable  Account, then the amount surrendered, or the insufficient  portion,   
will  be  deducted  from the Fixed Account in the ratio that  each  Guarantee   
Period's value bears to the total Fixed Account Value.                          

The  Certificate  Owner  may totally surrender the Certificate  by  making  a   
Written  Request. Surrendering the Certificate will end it.  Upon  surrender,   
the Certificate Owner will receive the Certificate Withdrawal Value.            

Keyport will pay the amount of any surrender within seven days of receipt  of   
such  request. Alternatively, the Certificate Owner may purchase for  himself   
or  herself an annuity option with any surrender benefit of at least  $5,000.   
Keyport's consent is needed to choose an option if the Certificate  Owner  is   
not a natural person.                                                           

Annuity  options  based  on life contingencies cannot  be  surrendered  after   
annuity  payments  have  begun.  Option  A,  which  is  not  based  on   life   
contingencies, may be surrendered if a variable payout has been selected.       

Because  of the potential tax consequences of a full or partial surrender,  a   
Certificate  Owner  should  consult  a  competent  tax  adviser  regarding  a   
surrender.                                                                      

ANNUITY PROVISIONS    

Annuity Benefits    

If the Annuitant is alive on the Income Date and the Certificate is In Force,   
payments will begin under the annuity option or options the Certificate Owner   
has  chosen.  The amount of the payments will be determined by  applying  the   
Certificate Value increased or decreased by a limited Market Value Adjustment   
of  Fixed  Account Value described in Appendix A (less any premium taxes  not   
previously  deducted and less any applicable Certificate Maintenance  Charge)   
on the Income Date in accordance with the option selected.                      

Income Date and Annuity Option    

The  Certificate Owner may select an Income Date and an Annuity Option at the   
time  of  application. If the Certificate Owner does not  select  an  Annuity   
Option,  Option B will automatically be designated. If the Certificate  Owner   
does  not  select  an  Income Date for the Annuitant, the  Income  Date  will   
automatically  be  the  earlier  of (i) the later  of  the  Annuitant's  90th   
birthday  and  the  10th Certificate Anniversary and (ii)  any  maximum  date   
permitted under state law.                                                      

Change in Income Date and Annuity Option    

The  Certificate Owner may choose or change an Annuity Option or  the  Income   
Date  by  making a Written Request to Keyport at least 30 days prior  to  the   
Income Date. However, any Income Date must be: (a) for fixed annuity options,   
not  earlier than the first Certificate Anniversary; and (b) not  later  than   
the  earlier of (i) the later of the Annuitant's 90th birthday and  the  10th   
Certificate Anniversary and (ii) any maximum date permitted under state law.    

Annuity Options   

The Annuity Options are:                                                        

Option A: Income for a Fixed Number of Years;                                   

Option B: Life Income with 10 Years of Payments Guaranteed; and                 

Option  C: Joint and Last Survivor Income.  Other options may be arranged  by   
mutual consent. Each option is available in two forms - as a variable annuity   
for  use  with  the  Variable Account and as a fixed  annuity  for  use  with   
Keyport's  general  account  Fixed Account. Variable  annuity  payments  will   
fluctuate  while fixed annuity payments will not. The dollar amount  of  each   
fixed  annuity payment will be determined by deducting from the Fixed Account   
Value  increased or decreased by a limited Market Value Adjustment  described   
in  Appendix A, any applicable premium taxes not previously deducted and then   
dividing  the remainder by $1,000 and multiplying the result by  the  greater   
of:  (a)  the  applicable  factor  shown in  the  appropriate  table  in  the   
Certificate;  or  (b)  the factor currently offered by Keyport  at  the  time   
annuity  payments begin. This current factor may be based on the sex  of  the   
payee unless to do so would be prohibited by law.                               

If  no  Annuity Option is selected, Option B will automatically  be  applied.   
Unless the Certificate Owner chooses otherwise, Variable Account Value  (less   
any  applicable premium taxes not previously deducted and less any applicable   
Certificate Maintenance Charge) will be applied to a variable annuity  option   
and  Fixed  Account  Value increased or decreased by a limited  Market  Value   
Adjustment  described in Appendix A (less any applicable  premium  taxes  not   
previously  deducted) will be applied to a fixed annuity option. Any  premium   
taxes  will be deducted proportionately from both Variable Account Value  and   
Fixed  Account  Value. Whether variable or fixed, the same Certificate  Value   
applied  to  each option will produce a different initial annuity payment  as   
well as different subsequent payments.                                          

The  payee  is the person who will receive the sum payable under  an  annuity   
option.  Any annuity option that provides for payments to continue after  the   
death of the payee will not allow the successor payee to extend the period of   
time over which the remaining payments are to be made.                          

If  the amount available to apply under any variable or fixed option is  less   
than $5,000, Keyport has reserved the right to pay such amount in one sum  to   
the payee in lieu of the payment otherwise provided for.                        

Annuity  payments  will  be made monthly unless quarterly,  semi-  annual  or   
annual  payments  are  chosen by Written Request.  However,  if  any  payment   
provided  for  would be or becomes less than $100, Keyport has the  right  to   
reduce  the frequency of payments to such an interval as will result in  each   
payment being at least $100.                                                    

Option A: Income For a Fixed Number of Years. Keyport will pay an annuity for   
a  chosen  number of years, not fewer than 5 nor over 50 (a period  of  years   
over  30 may be chosen only if it does not exceed the difference between  age   
100  and  the Annuitant's age on the date of the first payment). At any  time   
while  variable  annuity  payments are being made, the  payee  may  elect  to   
receive  the  following  amount:  (a) the  present  value  of  the  remaining   
payments, commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for   
this  option  (this  interest rate is 6% per year (5%  per  year  for  Oregon   
Certificates), unless 3% per year is chosen by Written Request  at  the  time   
the option is selected); less (b) any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge due by   
treating the value defined in (a) as a total surrender. (See "Deductions  for
Contingent  Deferred Sales Charge".) Instead of receiving  a  lump  sum,  the   
payee  may elect another payment option and the amount applied to the  option   
will  not be reduced by the charge defined in (b) above. If, at the death  of   
the  payee, Option A payments have been made for fewer than the chosen number   
of years:                                                                       

(a)  payments  will be continued during the remainder of the  period  to  the   
successor payee; or                                                             

(b) that successor payee may elect to receive in a lump sum the present value   
of  the remaining payments, commuted at the interest rate used to create  the   
annuity factor for this option. For the variable annuity, this interest  rate   
is  6% per year (5% per year for Oregon Certificates), unless 3% per year had   
been chosen by the payee at the time the option was selected.                   

The Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is deducted during the Option A payment   
period  if  a variable payout has been selected, but Keyport has no mortality   
risk during this period.                                                        

If  annual  payments are chosen for Option A and a variable payout  has  been   
selected,  Keyport has available a "stabilizing" payment option that  may  be   
chosen.  Each  annual  payment will be determined as described  in  "Variable
Annuity Payment Values". Each annual payment will then be placed in Keyport's   
general  account,  from  which it will be paid out in  twelve  equal  monthly   
payments.  The  sum  of the twelve monthly payments will  exceed  the  annual   
payment  amount because of an interest rate factor used by Keyport that  will   
vary  from  year  to  year.  The  commutation  method  described  above   for   
calculating  the present value of remaining payments applies  to  the  annual   
payments. Any monthly payments remaining before the next annual payment  will   
be  commuted  at  the  interest rate used to determine  that  year's  monthly   
payments.                                                                       

See  "Annuity Payments" on Page 23 for the manner in which Option  A  may  be   
taxed.                                                                          

Option B: Life Income with 10 Years of Payments Guaranteed. Keyport will  pay   
an  annuity during the lifetime of the payee. If, at the death of the  payee,   
payments have been made for fewer than 10 years:                                

(a)  payments  will be continued during the remainder of the  period  to  the   
successor payee; or                                                             

(b) that successor payee may elect to receive in a lump sum the present value   
of  the remaining payments, commuted at the interest rate used to create  the   
annuity factor for this option. For the variable annuity, this interest  rate   
is  6% per year (5% per year for Oregon Certificates), unless 3% per year had   
been chosen by the payee at the time the option was selected.                   

The amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of the payee on the   
Income Date and it may also depend on the payee's sex.                          

Option C: Joint and Last Survivor Income. Keyport will pay an annuity for  as   
long as either the payee or a designated second natural person is alive.  The   
amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of both persons on  the   
Income Date and it may also depend on each person's sex. IT IS POSSIBLE UNDER   
THIS OPTION TO RECEIVE ONLY ONE ANNUITY PAYMENT IF BOTH PAYEES DIE AFTER  THE   
RECEIPT OF THE FIRST PAYMENT OR TO RECEIVE ONLY TWO ANNUITY PAYMENTS IF  BOTH   
PAYEES DIE AFTER RECEIPT OF THE SECOND PAYMENT AND SO ON.                       

Variable Annuity Payment Values   

The  amount  of the first variable annuity payment is determined  by  Keyport   
using  an annuity purchase rate that is based on an assumed annual investment   
return  of  6% per year (5% per year for Oregon Certificates), unless  3%  is   
chosen  by  Written  Request.  Subsequent  variable  annuity  payments   will   
fluctuate in amount and reflect whether the actual investment return  of  the   
selected  Sub-Account(s)  (after deducting the  Mortality  and  Expense  Risk   
Charge)  is  better  or worse than the assumed investment return.  The  total   
dollar amount of each variable annuity payment will be equal to: (a) the  sum   
of  all  Sub-Account  payments; less (b) the pro-rata amount  of  the  annual   
Certificate  Maintenance Charge. Currently, a payee may instruct  Keyport  to   
change  the  Sub-Account(s)  used to determine the  amount  of  the  variable   
annuity payments unlimited times every 12 months.                               

Proof of Age, Sex, and Survival of Annuitant    

Keyport  may  require proof of age, sex or survival of any payee  upon  whose   
age,  sex  or survival payments depend. If the age or sex has been misstated,   
Keyport will compute the amount payable based on the correct age and sex.  If   
income  payments have begun, any underpayments Keyport may have made will  be   
paid  in full with the next annuity payment. Any overpayments, unless  repaid   
in  one  sum, will be deducted from future annuity payments until Keyport  is   
repaid in full.                                                                 

SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS    

Keyport  reserves  the right to postpone surrender payments  from  the  Fixed   
Account  for  up  to  six months. Keyport reserves the right  to  suspend  or   
postpone  any type of payment from the Variable Account for any period  when:   
(a)  the  New York Stock Exchange is closed other than customary  weekend  or   
holiday closings; (b) trading on the Exchange is restricted; (c) an emergency   
exists  as  a result of which it is not reasonably practicable to dispose  of   
securities held in the Variable Account or determine their value; or (d)  the   
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission permits delay  for  the  protection  of   
security holders. The applicable rules and regulations of the Securities  and   
Exchange  Commission shall govern as to whether the conditions  described  in   
(b) and (c) exist.                                                              

TAX STATUS 

Introduction    

The  Certificate is designed for use by individuals in retirement plans which   
may  or  may  not  be Qualified Plans under the provisions  of  the  Internal   
Revenue Code (the "Code"). The ultimate effect of federal income taxes on the   
Certificate  Value, on annuity payments, and on the economic benefit  to  the   
Certificate Owner, Annuitant or Designated Beneficiary depends on the type of   
retirement plan for which the Certificate is purchased and upon the  tax  and   
employment  status  of  the  individual concerned. The  discussion  contained   
herein  is  general in nature and is not intended as tax advice. Each  person   
concerned  should  consult a competent tax adviser. No  attempt  is  made  to   
consider  any  applicable state or other tax laws. Moreover,  the  discussion   
herein  is  based upon Keyport's understanding of current federal income  tax   
laws  as  they are currently interpreted. No representation is made regarding   
the likelihood of continuation of those current federal income tax laws or of   
the current interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service.                    

Taxation of Annuities in General    

Section 72 of the Code governs taxation of annuities in general. There are no   
income  taxes on increases in the value of a Certificate until a distribution   
occurs,  in  the form of a full surrender, a partial surrender, an assignment   
or  gift  of  the Certificate, or annuity payments. A trust or  other  entity   
owning  a  Non-Qualified Certificate other than as an agent for an individual   
is  taxed  differently;  increases in the value of a  Certificate  are  taxed   
yearly whether or not a distribution occurs.                                    

Surrenders,  Assignments and Gifts. A Certificate Owner who fully  surrenders   
his  or  her Certificate is taxed on the portion of the payment that  exceeds   
his or her cost basis in the Certificate. For Non-Qualified Certificates, the   
cost  basis  is generally the amount of the Purchase Payments  made  for  the   
Certificate  and  the taxable portion of the surrender payment  is  taxed  as   
ordinary income. For Qualified Certificates, the cost basis is generally zero   
and  the  taxable  portion of the surrender payment  is  generally  taxed  as   
ordinary  income,  subject to special 5-year income  averaging  for  lump-sum   
distributions  received  before  January 1, 2000.  A  Designated  Beneficiary   
receiving  a  lump sum surrender benefit after the death of the Annuitant  or   
Certificate  Owner  is taxed on the portion of the amount  that  exceeds  the   
Certificate  Owner's  cost  basis  in  the  Certificate.  If  the  Designated   
Beneficiary  elects  to  receive  annuity payments  within  60  days  of  the   
decedent's  death, different tax rules apply. See "Annuity  Payments"  below.   
For  Non-Qualified Certificates, the tax treatment applicable  to  Designated   
Beneficiaries may be contrasted with the income-tax-free treatment applicable   
to  persons  inheriting and then selling mutual fund shares with  a  date-of-   
death value in excess of their basis.                                           

Partial  withdrawals  received  under  Non-Qualified  Certificates  prior  to   
annuitization  are  first included in gross income to the extent  Certificate   
Value  exceeds  Purchase Payments. Then, to the extent the Certificate  Value   
does  not  exceed Purchase Payments, such withdrawals are treated as  a  non-   
taxable return of principal to the Certificate Owner. For partial withdrawals   
under  a  Qualified Certificate, payments are treated first as a  non-taxable   
return of principal up to the cost basis and then a taxable return of income.   
Since  the  cost basis of Qualified Certificates is generally  zero,  partial   
surrender amounts will generally be fully taxed as ordinary income.             

A  Certificate  Owner who assigns or pledges a Non-Qualified  Certificate  is   
treated as if he or she had received the amount assigned or pledged and  thus   
is  subject to taxation under the rules applicable to partial withdrawals  or   
surrenders.  A  Certificate  Owner  who gives  away  the  Certificate  (i.e.,   
transfers  it without full and adequate consideration) to anyone  other  than   
his  or  her  spouse is treated for income tax purposes as if he or  she  had   
fully surrendered the Certificate.                                              

A  special  computational rule applies if Keyport issues to  the  Certificate   
Owner,  during any calendar year, (a) two or more Certificates or (b) one  or   
more Certificates and one or more of Keyport's other annuity contracts. Under   
this  rule,  the  amount of any distribution includable  in  the  Certificate   
Owner's  gross income is to be determined under Section 72(e) of the Code  by   
treating  all  the Keyport contracts as one contract. Keyport  believes  that   
this  means  the  amount of any distribution under one  Certificate  will  be   
includable in gross income to the extent that at the time of distribution the   
sum  of  the values for all the Certificates or contracts exceeds the sum  of   
the cost bases for all the contracts.                                           

Annuity Payments. The non-taxable portion of each variable annuity payment is   
determined by dividing the cost basis of the Certificate that is allocated to   
Variable Account Value by the total number of expected payments while the non-  
taxable  portion of each fixed annuity payment is determined by an "exclusion   
ratio"  formula  which  establishes the ratio that  the  cost  basis  of  the   
Certificate  that  is allocated to Fixed Account Value  bears  to  the  total   
expected value of annuity payments for the term of the annuity. The remaining   
portion of each payment is taxable. Such taxable portion is taxed at ordinary   
income  rates. For Qualified Certificates, the cost basis is generally  zero.   
With  annuity payments based on life contingencies, the payments will  become   
fully  taxable once the payee lives longer than the life expectancy  used  to   
calculate  the  non-taxable portion of the prior payments.  Because  variable   
annuity  payments can increase over time and because certain payment  options   
provide  for  a lump sum right of commutation, it is possible  that  the  IRS   
could  determine  that  variable annuity payments  should  not  be  taxed  as   
described above but instead should be taxed as if they were received under an   
agreement to pay interest. This determination would result in a higher amount   
(up to 100%) of certain payments being taxable.                                 

With  respect  to  the "stabilizing" payment option available  under  Annuity   
Option  1,  pursuant  to  which each annual payment is  placed  in  Keyport's   
general  account and paid out with interest in twelve equal monthly payments,   
it  is  possible  the IRS could determine that receipt of the  first  monthly   
payout  of  each annual payment is constructive receipt of the entire  annual   
payment.  Thus,  the total taxable amount for each annual  payment  would  be   
accelerated to the time of the first monthly payout and reported in  the  tax   
year in which the first monthly payout is received.                             

Penalty  Tax.  Payments  received  by  Certificate  Owners,  Annuitants,  and   
Designated  Beneficiaries under Certificates may be subject to both  ordinary   
income  taxes and a penalty tax equal to 10% of the amount received  that  is   
includable in income. The penalty tax is not imposed on amounts received: (a)   
after the taxpayer attains age 59-1/2; (b) in a series of substantially equal   
payments  made  for  life  or life expectancy; (c) after  the  death  of  the   
Certificate  Owner  (or, where the Certificate Owner is not  a  human  being,   
after  the  death of the Annuitant); (d) if the taxpayer becomes totally  and   
permanently  disabled;  or  (e) under a Non-Qualified  Certificate's  annuity   
payment  option  that provides for a series of substantially equal  payments,   
provided  only  one  Purchase  Payment  is  made  to  the  Certificate,   the   
Certificate  is  not issued as a result of a Section 1035 exchange,  and  the   
first annuity payment begins in the first Certificate Year.                     

Income Tax Withholding. Keyport is required to withhold federal income  taxes   
on taxable amounts paid under Certificates unless the recipient elects not to   
have  withholding  apply. Keyport will notify recipients of  their  right  to   
elect not to have withholding apply. See "Tax-Sheltered Annuities" (TSAs) for   
an  alternative type of withholding that may apply to distributions from TSAs   
that  are  eligible  for rollover to another TSA or an individual  retirement   
annuity or account (IRA).                                                       

Section  1035  Exchanges. A Non-Qualified Certificate may be  purchased  with   
proceeds  from  the  surrender  of  an  existing  annuity  contract.  Such  a   
transaction  may qualify as a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section  1035  of   
the  Code. It is Keyport's understanding that in such an event: (a)  the  new   
Certificate  will be subject to the distribution-at-death rules described  in   
"Death Provisions for Non-Qualified Certificates"; (b) Purchase Payments made   
between August 14, 1982 and January 18, 1985 and the income allocable to them   
will,  following  an  exchange,  no longer be covered  by  a  "grandfathered"   
exception  to the penalty tax for a distribution of income that is  allocable   
to  an  investment  made  over ten years prior to the distribution;  and  (c)   
Purchase  Payments  made before August 14, 1982 and the income  allocable  to   
them   will,  following  an  exchange,  continue  to  receive  the  following   
"grandfathered" tax treatment under prior law: (i) the penalty tax  does  not   
apply  to any distribution; (ii) partial withdrawals are treated first  as  a   
non-taxable  return  of principal and then a taxable return  of  income;  and   
(iii)  assignments  are  not  treated  as  surrenders  subject  to  taxation.   
Keyport's  understanding  of the above is principally  based  on  legislative   
reports  prepared  by  the  Staff  of the Congressional  Joint  Committee  on   
Taxation.                                                                       

Diversification  Standards. The U.S. Secretary of  the  Treasury  has  issued   
regulations  that  set  standards  for  diversification  of  the  investments   
underlying  variable annuity contracts (other than pension  plan  contracts).   
The  Eligible  Funds  are designed to be managed to meet the  diversification   
requirements for the Certificate as those requirements may change  from  time   
to   time.  If  the  diversification  requirements  are  not  satisfied,  the   
Certificate would not be treated as an annuity contract. As a consequence  to   
the Certificate Owner, income earned on a Certificate would be taxable to the   
Certificate Owner in the year in which diversification requirements were  not   
satisfied, including previously non-taxable income earned in prior years.  As   
a  further consequence, Keyport would be subjected to federal income taxes on   
assets in the Variable Account.                                                 

The Secretary of the Treasury announced in September 1986 that he expects  to   
issue  regulations  which  will  prescribe  the  circumstances  in  which   a   
Certificate Owner's control of the investments of a segregated asset  account   
may  cause  the Certificate Owner, rather than the insurance company,  to  be   
treated  as  the  owner of the assets of the account. The  regulations  could   
impose  requirements  that  are not reflected in  the  Certificate.  Keyport,   
however,  has reserved certain rights to alter the Certificate and investment   
alternatives  so  as to comply with such regulations. Since  the  regulations   
have  not  been issued, there can be no assurance as to the content  of  such   
regulations  or  even  whether  application  of  the  regulations   will   be   
prospective. For these reasons, Certificate Owners are urged to consult  with   
their own tax advisers.                                                         

Qualified Plans   

The  Certificate  is designed for use with several types of Qualified  Plans.   
The  tax  rules  applicable  to participants in  such  Qualified  Plans  vary   
according  to  the  type  of plan and the terms and conditions  of  the  plan   
itself.  Therefore, no attempt is made herein to provide  more  than  general   
information  about  the  use of the Certificate with  the  various  types  of   
Qualified  Plans.  Participants  under  such  Qualified  Plans  as  well   as   
Certificate  Owners, Annuitants, and Designated Beneficiaries  are  cautioned   
that the rights of any person to any benefits under such Qualified Plans  may   
be  subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves regardless of   
the  terms  and conditions of the Certificate issued in connection therewith.   
Following are brief descriptions of the various types of Qualified Plans  and   
of  the  use  of the Certificate in connection therewith. Purchasers  of  the   
Certificate should seek competent advice concerning the terms and  conditions   
of the particular Qualified Plan and use of the Certificate with that Plan.     

Tax-Sheltered Annuities   

Section  403(b) of the Code permits public school employees and employees  of   
certain   types  of  charitable,  educational  and  scientific  organizations   
specified in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code to purchase annuity contracts and,   
subject  to certain contribution limitations, exclude the amount of  Purchase   
Payments  from gross income for tax purposes. However, such Purchase Payments   
may be subject to Social Security (FICA) taxes. This type of annuity contract   
is commonly referred to as a "Tax-Sheltered Annuity" (TSA).                     

Section   403(b)(11)   of   the  Code  contains  distribution   restrictions.   
Specifically,  benefits may be paid, through surrender of the Certificate  or   
otherwise,  only  (a)  when the employee attains age 59-1/2,  separates  from   
service, dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled (within the meaning   
of  Section 72(m)(7) of the Code) or (b) in the case of hardship. A  hardship   
distribution  must be of employee contributions only and not  of  any  income   
attributable  to  such contributions. Section 403(b)(11) does  not  apply  to   
distributions attributable to assets held as of December 31, 1988.  Thus,  it   
appears  that  the  law's  restrictions would  apply  only  to  distributions   
attributable  to  contributions  made  after  1988,  to  earnings  on   those   
contributions, and to earnings on amounts held as of 12/31/88.  The  Internal   
Revenue  Service has indicated that the distribution restrictions of  Section   
403(b)(11)  are not applicable when TSA funds are being transferred  tax-free   
directly to another TSA issuer, provided the transferred funds continue to be   
subject to the Section 403(b)(11) distribution restrictions.                    

Keyport will notify a Certificate Owner who has requested a distribution from   
a Certificate if all or part of such distribution is eligible for rollover to   
another  TSA  or  to an individual retirement annuity or account  (IRA).  Any   
amount  eligible for rollover treatment will be subject to mandatory  federal   
income  tax  withholding at a 20% rate if the Certificate Owner receives  the   
amount  rather  than  directing Keyport by Written Request  to  transfer  the   
amount as a direct rollover to another TSA or IRA.                              

Individual Retirement Annuities   

Section 408(b) of the Code permits eligible individuals to contribute  to  an   
individual  retirement program known as an "Individual  Retirement  Annuity."   
These  Individual  Retirement Annuities are subject  to  limitations  on  the   
amount which may be contributed, the persons who may be eligible, and on  the   
time when distributions may commence. In addition, distributions from certain   
types  of  Qualified  Plans  may be placed on a tax-deferred  basis  into  an   
Individual Retirement Annuity.                                                  

Corporate Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans    

Sections  401(a)  and  403(a)  of  the Code  permit  corporate  employers  to   
establish  various types of retirement plans for employees.  Such  retirement   
plans  may  permit the purchase of the Certificate to provide benefits  under   
the plans.                                                                      

Deferred  Compensation  Plans With Respect to Service  for  State  and  Local   
Governments                                                                     

Section 457 of the Code, while not actually providing for a Qualified Plan as   
that  term is normally used, provides for certain deferred compensation plans   
that  enjoy  special income tax treatment with respect to  service  for  tax-   
exempt organizations, state governments, local governments, and agencies  and   
instrumentalities of such governments. The Certificate can be used with  such   
plans. Under such plans, a participant may specify the form of investment  in   
which  his  or her participation will be made. However, all such  investments   
are owned by and subject to the claims of general creditors of the sponsoring   
employer.                                                                       

VARIABLE ACCOUNT VOTING PRIVILEGES    

In  accordance with its view of present applicable law, Keyport will vote the   
shares  of  the  Eligible Funds held in the Variable Account at  regular  and   
special meetings of the shareholders of the Eligible Funds in accordance with   
instructions received from persons having the voting interest in the Variable   
Account.  Keyport will vote shares for which it has not received instructions   
in  the  same  proportion  as  it votes shares  for  which  it  has  received   
instructions.                                                                   

However,  if the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any regulation  thereunder   
should be amended or if the present interpretation thereof should change, and   
as a result Keyport determines that it is permitted to vote the shares of the   
Eligible Funds in its own right, it may elect to do so.                         

The person having the voting interest under a Certificate prior to the Income   
Date  shall be the Certificate Owner. The number of shares held in each  Sub-   
Account  which  are attributable to each Certificate Owner is  determined  by   
dividing  the Certificate Owner's Variable Account Value in each  Sub-Account   
by  the  net  asset value of the applicable share of the Eligible  Fund.  The   
person  having  the voting interest after the Income Date  under  an  annuity   
payment  option shall be the payee. The number of shares held in the Variable   
Account  which are attributable to each payee is determined by  dividing  the   
reserve for the annuity payments by the net asset value of one share.  During   
the annuity payment period, the votes attributable to a payee decrease as the   
reserves underlying the payments decrease.                                      

The  number  of  shares  in  which a person has a  voting  interest  will  be   
determined  as  of  the  date coincident with the  date  established  by  the   
respective Eligible Fund for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the   
meeting  of  the  Fund and voting instructions will be solicited  by  written   
communication  prior  to  such  meeting in  accordance  with  the  procedures   
established by the Eligible Fund.                                               

Each  person having the voting interest in the Variable Account will  receive   
periodic reports relating to the Eligible Fund(s) in which he or she  has  an   
interest,  proxy  material  and  a  form  with  which  to  give  such  voting   
instructions with respect to the proportion of the Eligible Fund shares  held   
in  the Variable Account corresponding to his or her interest in the Variable   
Account.                                                                        

SALES OF THE CERTIFICATES 

Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC") serves as the Principal Underwriter   
for  the  Certificate described in this prospectus. The Certificate  will  be   
sold  by  salespersons  who represent Keyport Life Insurance  Company  KFSC's   
corporate   parent  as  variable  annuity  agents  and  who  are   registered   
representatives   of  broker/dealers  who  have  entered  into   distribution   
agreements with KFSC. KFSC is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of   
1934  and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.   
It is located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.                  

Certificates may be sold with lower or no dealer compensation (1) to a person   
who  is an officer, director, or employee of Keyport or of certain affiliates   
of  Keyport or (2) to any Qualified Plan established for such a person.  Such   
Certificates  may  have provisions different from the  Certificates  sold  to   
others  in that (1) they are not subject to the deduction for the Certificate   
Maintenance  Charge, the asset-based Sales charge or the Contingent  Deferred   
Sales  Charge and (2) they have a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge of  0.35%   
per year.                                                                       

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

There are no legal proceedings to which the Variable Account or the Principal   
Underwriter  are  a  party. Keyport is engaged in various  kinds  of  routine   
litigation which in its judgment is not of material importance in relation to   
the total capital and surplus of Keyport.

APPENDIX A    
THE FIXED ACCOUNT (ALSO KNOWN AS THE MODIFIED GUARANTEED ANNUITY ACCOUNT)   

Introduction    

This  Appendix  describes  the  Fixed  Account  option  available  under  the   
Certificate.                                                                    

FIXED  ACCOUNT  VALUES PROVIDED BY THE CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT  TO  A  MARKET   
VALUE  ADJUSTMENT,  THE OPERATION OF WHICH MAY RESULT IN UPWARD  OR  DOWNWARD   
ADJUSTMENTS  IN AMOUNTS TRANSFERRED AND AMOUNTS PAID (INCLUDING  WITHDRAWALS,   
SURRENDERS, DEATH BENEFITS, AND AMOUNTS APPLIED TO PURCHASE ANNUITY PAYMENTS)   
TO  A  CERTIFICATE OWNER OR OTHER PAYEE. IN NO EVENT WILL THE DOWNWARD MARKET   
VALUE ADJUSTMENT ELIMINATE INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 3% PER YEAR APPLIED TO THE   
AMOUNT  ALLOCATED  TO A GUARANTEED PERIOD. PAYMENTS MADE FROM  FIXED  ACCOUNT   
VALUES  AT  THE END OF THEIR GUARANTEE PERIOD ARE NOT SUBJECT TO  THE  MARKET   
VALUE ADJUSTMENT.                                                               

Purchase  Payments  allocated  to the Fixed Account  option  become  part  of   
Keyport's  general account. Because of applicable exemptive and  exclusionary   
provisions,  interests in the Fixed Account options have not been  registered   
under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"), nor is the general account  an   
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, neither the   
general  account,  the  Fixed Account option, nor any  interest  therein,  is   
subject  to  regulation  under the 1933 Act or the  Investment  Company  Act.   
Keyport  understands  that  the Securities and Exchange  Commission  has  not   
reviewed the disclosure in the prospectus relating to the general account and   
the Fixed Account option.                                                       

Investments in the Fixed Account and Capital Protection Plus    

Purchase  Payments will be allocated to the Fixed Account in accordance  with   
the selection made by the Certificate Owner in the application. Any selection   
must  specify that percentage of the Purchase Payment that is to be allocated   
to  each Guarantee Period of the Fixed Account. The percentage, if not  zero,   
must  be  at  least  5%.  The  Certificate Owner may  change  the  allocation   
percentages without fee, penalty or other charge. Allocation changes must  be   
made  by  Written Request unless the Certificate Owner has by Written Request   
authorized  Keyport  to  accept telephone allocation  instructions  from  the   
Certificate  Owner.  By authorizing Keyport to accept  telephone  changes,  a   
Certificate  Owner  agrees  to  accept and be bound  by  the  conditions  and   
procedures  established by Keyport from time to time. The current  conditions   
and procedures are in Appendix C and Certificate Owners authorizing telephone   
allocation instructions will be notified, in advance, of any changes.           

Keyport  currently offers Guarantee Periods of 1, 3, 5, and 7 years.  Keyport   
may change at any time the number of Guarantee Periods it offers under newly-   
issued  and  in-force Certificates, as well as the length of those  Guarantee   
Periods.  If  Keyport stops offering a particular Guarantee Period,  existing   
Fixed Account Value in such Guarantee Period would not be affected until  the   
end  of the Period (at that time, a Period of the same length would not be  a   
transfer  option). Each Guarantee Period currently offered is  available  for   
initial  and  subsequent Purchase Payments and for transfers  of  Certificate   
Value.                                                                          

Keyport offers a Capital Protection Plus program that a Certificate Owner may   
request.  Under  this  program, Keyport will allocate part  of  the  Purchase   
Payment  to  the Guarantee Period selected by the Certificate Owner  so  that   
such  part, based on that Guarantee Period's interest rate in effect  on  the   
date  of allocation, will equal at the end of the Guarantee Period the  total   
Purchase Payment. The rest of the Purchase Payment will be allocated  to  the   
Sub-Account(s)  of  the  Variable Account based on  the  Certificate  Owner's   
allocation.  If  any  part  of  the Fixed Account  Value  is  surrendered  or   
transferred before the end of the Guarantee Period, the Value at the  end  of   
that Period will not equal the original Purchase Payment amount.                

For an example of Capital Protection Plus, assume Keyport receives a Purchase   
Payment of $10,000 when the interest rate for the 7-year Guarantee Period  is   
6.75% per year. Keyport will allocate $6,331 to that Guarantee Period because   
$6,331  will  increase at that interest rate to $10,000 after  7  years.  The   
remaining  $3,669  of  the payment will be allocated  to  the  Sub-Account(s)   
selected by the Certificate Owner.                                              

Fixed Account Value   

The Fixed Account Value at any time is equal to:                                

(a)   all  Purchase Payments allocated to the Fixed Account plus the interest   
subsequently credited on those payments; plus                                   

(b)   any  Variable Account Value transferred to the Fixed Account  plus  the   
interest subsequently credited on the transferred value; less                   

(c)   any  prior  partial withdrawals from the Fixed Account,  including  any   
charges therefor; less                                                          

(d)  any Fixed Account Value transferred to the Variable Account.               

Interest Credits    

Keyport  will  credit  interest daily (based on an annual  compound  interest   
rate)  to  Purchase Payments allocated to the Fixed Account at rates declared   
by  Keyport for Guarantee Periods of one or more years from the month and day   
of allocation. Any rate set by Keyport will be at least 3% per year.            

Keyport's  method of crediting interest means that Fixed Account Value  might   
be subject to different rates for each Guarantee Period the Certificate Owner   
has  selected  in  the Fixed Account. For purposes of this section,  Variable   
Account  Value  transferred  to the Fixed Account  and  Fixed  Account  Value   
renewed  for another Guarantee Period shall be treated as a Purchase  Payment   
allocation.                                                                     

Application of Market Value Adjustment    

Any  surrender, withdrawal, transfer, or application to an Annuity Option  of   
Fixed Account Value from a Guarantee Period of three years or more is subject   
to  a limited Market Value Adjustment, unless: (1) the effective date of  the   
transaction is at the end of the Guarantee Period; or (2) the effective  date   
of  a  surrender is within 90 days of the date of death of the first  Covered   
Person to die.                                                                  

If a Market Value Adjustment applies to either a surrender or the application   
to  an Annuity Option, then any negative Market Value Adjustment amount  will   
be  deducted  from  the  Certificate Value  and  any  positive  Market  Value   
Adjustment  amount will be added to the Certificate Value. If a Market  Value   
Adjustment  applies  to either a partial withdrawal or a transfer,  then  any   
negative  Market  Value Adjustment amount will be deducted from  the  partial   
withdrawal  or  transfer amount after the withdrawal or transfer  amount  has   
been  deducted  from the Fixed Account Value, and any positive  Market  Value   
Adjustment  amount will be added to the applicable amount after it  has  been   
deducted from the Fixed Account Value.                                          

No  Market Value Adjustment is ever applicable to Guarantee Periods of  fewer   
than three years.                                                               

Effect of Market Value Adjustment   

A  Market Value Adjustment reflects the change in prevailing current interest   
rates  since the beginning of a Guarantee Period. The Market Value Adjustment   
may  be  positive or negative, but any negative Adjustment may be limited  in   
amount (see Market Value Adjustment Factor below).                              

Generally,  if the Treasury Rate for the Guarantee Period is lower  than  the   
Treasury  Rate  for a new Guarantee Period with a length equal  to  the  time   
remaining in the Guarantee Period, then the application of the limited Market   
Value  Adjustment will result in a reduction of the amount being surrendered,   
withdrawn, transferred, or applied to an Annuity Option.                        

Similarly, if the Treasury Rate for the Guarantee Period is higher  than  the   
Treasury  Rate  for a new Guarantee Period with a length equal  to  the  time   
remaining  in the Guarantee Period, then the application of the Market  Value   
Adjustment  will  result  in  an increase in the  amount  being  surrendered,   
withdrawn, transferred, or applied to an Annuity Option.                        

The  Market  Value  Adjustment will be applied before the  deduction  of  any   
applicable surrender charges or applicable taxes.                               

Market Value Adjustment Factor    

The  Market  Value  Adjustment is computed by multiplying  the  amount  being   
surrendered, withdrawn, transferred, or applied to a Payment Option,  by  the   
Market  Value  Adjustment  Factor.  The Market  Value  Adjustment  Factor  is   
calculated as the larger of Formula (1) or (2):                                 

(1) (1+a)/(1+b)(n/12)-1                                                         

where:                                                                          

"a"  is  the  Treasury Rate for the number of Guarantee Period Years  in  the   
Guarantee Period;                                                               

"b" is the Treasury Rate for a period equal to the time remaining (rounded up   
to  the next whole number of Guarantee Period Years) to the expiration of the   
Guarantee Period; and                                                           

"n"  is  the number of complete Guarantee Period Months remaining before  the   
expiration of the Guarantee Period.                                             

(2) (1.03)/(1+i)(y+d/#)-1                                                       

where:                                                                          

"i" is the Guaranteed Interest Rate for the Guarantee Period;                   

"y" is the number of complete Guarantee Period Years that have elapsed in the   
Guarantee Period;                                                               

"d" is the number of days since the last Guarantee Period Anniversary or,  if   

"y" is zero, the number of days since the start of the Guarantee Period; and    

"#" is the number of days in the current Guarantee Period Year (i.e., the sum   
of "d" and the number of days until the next Guarantee Period Anniversary).     

In Formulas (1) and (2), all references to Guarantee Period, Guarantee Period   
Anniversary, Guarantee Period Month, and Guarantee Period Year relate to  the   
Guarantee  Period  from  which is being taken the amount  being  surrendered,   
withdrawn, transferred, or applied to an Annuity Option.                        

As stated above, the Formula (2) amount will apply only if it is greater than   
the  Formula (1) amount. This will occur only when the Formula (1) amount  is   
negative and the Formula (2) amount is a smaller negative number. Formula (2)   
thus ensures that a full (normal) negative Market Value Adjustment of Formula   
(1)  will  not  apply to the extent it would decrease the Guarantee  Period's   
Fixed Account Value (before the deduction of any applicable surrender charges   
or any applicable taxes) below the following amount:                            

(a)  the amount allocated to the Guarantee Period; less                 
(b)  any prior systematic or partial withdrawal amounts; less           
 (c)   any prior amounts transferred to the Variable Account or to another
Guarantee Period in the Fixed Account; plus                                     
  (d)  interest on the above items (a) through (c) credited annually at  a
rate of 3% per year.                                                            

Treasury Rates    

The Treasury Rate for a Guarantee Period is the interest rate in the Treasury   
Constant  Maturity Series, as published by the Federal Reserve Board,  for  a   
maturity equal to the number of years specified in "a" and "b" in Formula (1)   
above. Weekly Series are published at the beginning of the following week. To   
determine "a", Keyport uses the weekly Series first published on or after the   
most  recent Determination Date which occurs on or before the Start Date  for   
the  Guarantee  Period, except that if the Start Date  is  the  same  as  the   
Determination  Date  or  the date of publication, or  any  date  in  between,   
Keyport  instead  uses  the  weekly Series first published  after  the  prior   
Determination  Date. To determine "b", Keyport uses the weekly  Series  first   
published on or after the most recent Determination Date which occurs  on  or   
before  the  date on which the Market Value Adjustment Factor is  calculated,   
except that if the calculation date is the same as the Determination Date  or   
the  date  of publication, or any date in between, Keyport instead  uses  the   
weekly  Series  first  published  after the  prior  Determination  Date.  The   
Determination  Dates  are  the last business  day  prior  to  the  first  and   
fifteenth of each calendar month.                                               

If  the number of years specified in "a" or "b" is not equal to a maturity in   
the  Treasury Constant Maturity Series, the Treasury Rate will be  determined   
by straight line interpolation between the interest rates of the next highest   
and next lowest maturities.                                                     

If  the  Treasury Constant Maturity Series becomes unavailable, Keyport  will   
adopt  a  comparable constant maturity index or, if such a  comparable  index   
also  is  not  available, Keyport will replicate calculation of the  Treasury   
Constant Maturity Series Index based on U.S. Treasury Security coupon rates.    

End of A Guarantee Period   

Keyport will notify a Certificate Owner in writing at least 30 days prior  to   
the  end  of a Guarantee Period. At the end of the Guarantee Period,  Keyport   
will automatically transfer the Guarantee Period's Fixed Account Value to the   
Money  Market  Sub-Account of the Variable Account unless Keyport  previously   
received  a  Certificate Owner's Written Request of: (1) election  of  a  new   
Guarantee Period from among those being offered by Keyport at that  time;  or   
(2)  instructions  to  transfer the ending Guarantee Period's  Fixed  Account   
Value  to  one or more Sub-accounts of the Variable Account. A new  Guarantee   
Period  cannot be longer than the number of years remaining until the  Income   
Date.                                                                           

Transfers of Fixed Account Value    

The  Certificate  Owner may transfer Fixed Account Value from  one  Guarantee   
Period  to  another  or to one or more Sub-Accounts of the  Variable  Account   
subject to any applicable Market Value Adjustment. If the Fixed Account Value   
represents multiple Guarantee Periods, the transfer request must specify from   
which values the transfer is to be made.                                        

The  Certificate allows Keyport to limit the number of transfers that can  be   
made  in  a  specified time period. Currently, Keyport is  limiting  Variable   
Account  and  Fixed  Account transfers to generally unlimited  transfers  per   
calendar  year  with a $500,000 per transfer dollar limit. See  "Transfer  of
Variable  Account Value". These limitations will not apply  to  any  transfer   
made  at  the end of a Guarantee Period. Certificate Owners will be notified,   
in advance, of a change in the limitation on the number of transfers.           

Transfer requests must be by Written Request unless the Certificate Owner has   
authorized   Keyport   by  Written  Request  to  accept  telephone   transfer   
instructions  from  the  Certificate Owner or from a person  acting  for  the   
Certificate  Owner  as  an attorney-in-fact under a  power  of  attorney.  By   
authorizing  Keyport to accept telephone transfer instructions, a Certificate   
Owner  agrees  to  accept  and  be  bound by the  conditions  and  procedures   
established  by  Keyport  from  time  to time.  The  current  conditions  and   
procedures  are  in  Appendix B and Certificate Owners authorizing  telephone   
transfers  will  be  notified, in advance, of any changes.  Written  transfer   
requests  may  be  made by a person acting for the Certificate  Owner  as  an   
attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney.                                     

Transfer requests received by Keyport before the close of trading on the  New   
York Stock Exchange (currently 4:00 PM Eastern Time) will be executed at  the   
close  of business that day. Any requests received later will be executed  at   
the close of the next business day.                                             

The  amount of the transfer will be deducted from the specified values in the   
manner stated in the next section below.                                        

If  100%  of  a  Guarantee  Period's value is  transferred  and  the  current   
allocation  for  Purchase Payments includes that Guarantee Period,  then  the   
allocation  formula  for future Purchase Payments will  automatically  change   
unless  the  Certificate  Owner  instructs otherwise.  For  example,  if  the   
allocation  formula is 50% to the one-year Guarantee Period and 50%  to  Sub-   
Account  A and all Fixed Account Value is transferred to Sub-Account  A,  the   
allocation formula will change to 100% to Sub-Account A.                        

APPENDIX B    
TELEPHONE INSTRUCTIONS    

Telephone Transfers of Certificate Values   

1.  If  there  are Joint Certificate Owners, both must authorize  Keyport  to   
accept  telephone instructions but either Certificate Owner may give  Keyport   
telephone instructions.                                                         

2.  All callers will be required to identify themselves. Keyport reserves the   
right  to  refuse to act upon any telephone instructions in cases  where  the   
caller   has   not  sufficiently  identified  himself/herself  to   Keyport's   
satisfaction.                                                                   

3.  Neither  Keyport nor any person acting on its behalf shall be subject  to   
any  claim,  loss, liability, cost or expense if it or such person  acted  in   
good  faith  upon a telephone instruction, including one that is unauthorized   
or  fraudulent; however, Keyport will employ reasonable procedures to confirm   
that a telephone instruction is genuine and, if Keyport does not, Keyport may   
be  liable  for losses due to an unauthorized or fraudulent instruction.  The   
Certificate  Owner  thus  bears the risk that an unauthorized  or  fraudulent   
instruction that is executed may cause the Certificate Value to be lower than   
it would be had no instruction been executed.                                   

4.  All  conversations will be recorded with disclosure at the  time  of  the   
call.                                                                           

5.  The  application  for the Certificate may allow a  Certificate  Owner  to   
create  a  power of attorney by authorizing another person to give  telephone   
instructions. Unless prohibited by state law, such power will be  treated  as   
durable  in  nature  and shall not be affected by the subsequent  incapacity,   
disability  or incompetency of the Certificate Owner. Either Keyport  or  the   
authorized person may cease to honor the power by sending written  notice  to   
the  Certificate Owner at the Certificate Owner's last known address. Neither   
Keyport nor any person acting on its behalf shall be subject to liability for   
any act executed in good faith reliance upon a power of attorney.               

6. Telephone authorization shall continue in force until (a) Keyport receives   
the  Certificate  Owner's  written revocation, (b) Keyport  discontinues  the   
privilege,  or  (c)  Keyport receives written evidence that  the  Certificate   
Owner has entered into a market timing or asset allocation agreement with  an   
investment adviser or with a broker/dealer.                                     

7. Telephone transfer instructions received by Keyport at 800-367-3653 before   
the  close  of  trading on the New York Stock Exchange (currently  4:00  P.M.   
Eastern  Time)  will  be initiated that day based on the  unit  value  prices   
calculated at the close of that day. Instructions received after the close of   
trading on the NYSE will be initiated the following business day.               

8. Once instructions are accepted by Keyport, they may not be canceled.         

9. All transfers must be made in accordance with the terms of the Certificate   
and  current prospectus. If the transfer instructions are not in good  order,   
Keyport  will not execute the transfer and will notify the caller  within  48   
hours.                                                                          

10.  If  100%  of  any Sub-Account's value is transferred and the  allocation   
formula  for Purchase Payments includes that Sub-Account, then the allocation   
formula  for future Purchase Payments will change accordingly unless  Keyport   
receives  telephone  instructions  to  the  contrary.  For  example,  if  the   
allocation formula is 50% to Sub-Account A and 50% to Sub-Account B  and  all   
of  Sub-Account  A's value is transferred to Sub-Account  B,  the  allocation   
formula  will  change to 100% to Sub-Account B unless Keyport  is  instructed   
otherwise.

KEYPORT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY      

   Liberty  Mutual  Insurance  Company ("Liberty  Mutual"),  a  multi-line
insurance  company,  is the ultimate corporate parent  of  Keyport.   Liberty   
Mutual  ultimately controls Keyport through the following intervening holding   
company subsidiaries:  Liberty Mutual Equity Corporation, LFC Holdings  Inc.,   
Liberty Financial Companies, Inc. ("LFC") and SteinRoe Services, Inc. Liberty   
Mutual, as of December 31, 1996, owned, indirectly, approximately 83% of  the   
combined voting power of the outstanding stock of LFC (with the balance being   
publicly held). For additional information about Keyport, see page 8  of  the   
prospectus.                                                                     

VARIABLE ANNUITY BENEFITS 

Variable Annuity Payment Values                                                 

   For  each  variable  payment option, the total dollar  amount  of  each
periodic  payment will be equal to: (a) the sum of all Sub-account  payments;   
less (b) the pro-rata amount of the annual Certificate Maintenance Charge.      

   The  first payment for each Sub-Account will be determined by deducting
any  applicable  Certificate  Maintenance Charge  and  any  applicable  state   
premium  taxes  and then dividing the remaining value of that Sub-Account  by   
$1,000  and  multiplying  the result by the greater of:  (a)  the  applicable   
factor  from  the  Certificate's annuity table  for  the  particular  payment   
option;  or  (b) the factor currently offered by Keyport at the time  annuity   
payments  begin.  This current factor may be based on the sex  of  the  payee   
unless to do so would be prohibited by law.                                     

   The number of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account will be determined  by
dividing  such  first payment by the Sub-Account Annuity Unit value  for  the   
Valuation Period that includes the date of the first payment.  The number  of   
Annuity Units remains fixed for the annuity payment period.  Each Sub-Account   
payment  after the first one will be determined by multiplying  (a)  by  (b),   
where:  (a)  is  the  number of Sub-Account Annuity Units;  and  (b)  is  the   
Sub-Account  Annuity Unit value for the Valuation Period  that  includes  the   
date of the particular payment.                                                 

   Variable  annuity  payments  will  fluctuate  in  accordance  with  the
investment  results of the underlying Eligible Funds.  In order to  determine   
how  these fluctuations affect annuity payments, Keyport uses an Annuity Unit   
value.   Each Sub-Account has its own Annuity Units and value per Unit.   The   
Annuity  Unit  value applicable during any Valuation Period is determined  at   
the end of such period.                                                         

   When  Keyport  first purchased Eligible Fund shares on  behalf  of  the
Variable Account, Keyport valued each Annuity Unit for each Sub-Account at  a   
specified dollar amount. The Unit value for each Sub-Account in any Valuation   
Period thereafter is determined by multiplying the value for the prior period   
by  a  net  investment factor.  This factor may be greater or less than  1.0;   
therefore, the Annuity Unit may increase or decrease from Valuation Period to   
Valuation  Period.   For each assumed annual investment rate  (AIR),  Keyport   
calculates  a net investment factor for each Sub-Account by dividing  (a)  by   
(b), where:                                                                     

       (a)   is  equal  to  the net investment factor as  defined  in  the
       prospectus  without any deduction for the sales charge  defined  in
(c)(ii) of the net investment factor formula; and           

       (b)   is  the  assumed investment factor for the current  Valuation
       Period.   The  assumed investment factor adjusts for  the  interest
       assumed  in  determining the first variable annuity payment.   Such
       factor for any Valuation Period shall be the accumulated value,  at
       the end of such period, of $1.00 deposited at the beginning of such
       period  at the assumed annual investment rate (AIR).  The  AIR  for
       Annuity Units based on the Certificate's annuity tables is  6%  per
       year  (5% per year for Oregon Certificates).  An AIR of 3% per year
is also currently available upon Written Request.           

   With  a  particular AIR, payments after the first one will increase  or
decrease  from  month  to  month  based  on  whether  the  actual  annualized   
investment  return  of  the  selected  Sub-Account(s)  (after  deducting  the   
Mortality  and Expense Risk Charge) is better or worse than the  assumed  AIR   
percentage.   If  a  given  amount  of Sub-Account  value  is  applied  to  a   
particular payment option, the initial payment will be smaller if a 3% AIR is   
selected  instead  of  a  6%  AIR  but, all other  things  being  equal,  the   
subsequent 3% AIR payments have the potential for increasing in amount  by  a   
larger percentage and for decreasing in amount by a smaller percentage.   For   
example,  consider  what  would  happen if the actual  annualized  investment   
return  (see  the  first sentence of this paragraph) is 9%,  6%,  3%,  or  0%   
between the time of the first and second payments.  With an actual 9% return,   
the  3% AIR and 6% AIR payments would both increase in amount but the 3%  AIR   
payment would increase by a larger percentage.  With an actual 6% return, the   
3%  AIR payment would increase in amount while the 6% AIR payment would  stay   
the  same.   With an actual return of 3%, the 3% AIR payment would  stay  the   
same  while  the 6% AIR payment would decrease in amount.  Finally,  with  an   
actual  return of 0%, the 3% AIR and 6% AIR payments would both  decrease  in   
amount  but the 3% AIR payment would decrease by a smaller percentage.   Note   
that the changes in payment amounts described above are on a percentage basis   
and  thus  do  not illustrate when, if ever, the 3% AIR payment amount  might   
become  larger than the 6% AIR payment amount.  Note though that if Option  1   
(Income  for  a Fixed Number of Years) is selected and payments continue  for   
the  entire  period, the 3% AIR payment amount will start out  being  smaller   
than  the 6% AIR payment amount but eventually the 3% AIR payment amount will   
become larger than the 6% AIR payment amount.                                   

Re-Allocating Sub-Account Payments                                              

   The  number  of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account under  any  variable
annuity  option  will remain fixed during the entire annuity  payment  period   
unless  the payee makes a written request for a change.  Currently,  a  payee   
can  instruct  Keyport  to change the Sub-Account(s) used  to  determine  the   
amount of the variable annuity payments unlimited times every 12 months.  The   
payee's request must specify the percentage of the annuity payment that is to   
be  based  on the investment performance of each Sub-Account.  The percentage   
for  each Sub-Account, if not zero, must be at least 5% and must be  a  whole   
number.  At the end of the Valuation Period during which Keyport receives the   
request,  Keyport will: (a) value the Annuity Units for each  Sub-Account  to   
create  a  total annuity value; (b) apply the new percentages the  payee  has   
selected  to this total value; and (c) recompute the number of Annuity  Units   
for  each  Sub-Account.  This new number of units will remain fixed  for  the   
remainder of the payment period unless the payee requests another change.

such reports given upon the authority of such firm as experts in accounting     
and auditing.                                                                   

The consolidated financial statements of Keyport Life Insurance Company and     
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and for each of the years in the two-year  
period ended December 31, 1995 have been included herein in reliance on the     
report of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, independent certified public accountants, and  
upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. The      
report of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP covering the December 31, 1995 financial        
statements refers to a change in accounting to adopt Statement of Financial     
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Dept and

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE 

  The Variable Account may from time to time quote performance information
concerning its various Sub-Accounts.  A Sub-Account's performance may also be   
compared  to  the  performance of sub-accounts used with  variable  annuities   
offered  by other insurance companies.  This comparative information  may  be   
expressed  as  a  ranking prepared by Financial Planning Resources,  Inc.  of   
Miami,  FL  (The  VARDS  Report), Lipper Analytical  Services,  Inc.,  or  by   
Morningstar, Inc. of Chicago, IL (Morningstar's Variable Annuity  Performance   
Report),  which  are  independent services that compare  the  performance  of   
variable annuity sub-accounts.  The rankings are done on the basis of changes   
in  accumulation  unit  values over time and do not  take  into  account  any   
charges  (such as sales charges or administrative charges) that are  deducted   
directly from contract values.                                                  

  Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, IL provides historical returns from 1926
on  capital markets in the United States.  The Variable Account may quote the   
performance of its Sub-Accounts in conjunction with the long-term performance   
of  capital  markets  in  order to illustrate general long-term  risk  versus   
reward  investment scenarios.  Capital markets tracked by Ibbotson Associates   
include common stocks, small company stocks, long-term corporate bonds, long-   
term  government  bonds, U.S. Treasury Bills, and the  U.S.  inflation  rate.   
Historical  total returns are determined by Ibbotson Associates  for:   Large   
Company Stocks, represented by the Standard and Poor's Composite Price  Index   
(an  unmanaged weighted index of 90 stocks prior to March 1957 and 500 stocks   
thereafter  of  industrial, transportation, utility and  financial  companies   
widely  regarded by investors as representative of the stock  market);  Small   
Company  Stocks, represented by the fifth capitalization quintile (i.e.,  the   
ninth  and tenth deciles) of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange for  1926-   
1981  and  by the performance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors Small  Company   
9/10  (for  ninth  and  tenth deciles) Fund thereafter; Long  Term  Corporate   
Bonds, represented beginning in 1969 by the Salomon Brothers Long-Term  High-   
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which is an unmanaged index of nearly all Aaa and   
Aa  rated bonds, represented for 1946-1968 by backdating the Salomon Brothers   
Index  using Salomon Brothers' monthly yield data with a methodology  similar   
to  that used by Salomon Brothers in computing its Index, and represented for   
1925-1945  through  the  use  of the Standard and Poor's  monthly  High-Grade   
Corporate  Composite yield data, assuming a 4% coupon and a 20-year maturity;   
Long-Term  Government Bonds, measured each year using a portfolio  containing   
one  U.S.  government bond with a term of approximately twenty  years  and  a   
reasonably current coupon; U.S. Treasury Bills, measured by rolling over each   
month  a  one-bill portfolio containing, at the beginning of each month,  the   
shortest-term  bill  having not less than one month to  maturity;  Inflation,   
measured  by the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, not seasonably   
adjusted,  since January, 1978 and by the Consumer Price Index  before  then.   
The  stock capital markets may be contrasted with the corporate bond and U.S.   
government  securities capital markets.  Unlike an investment  in  stock,  an   
investment  in  a  bond that is held to maturity provides  a  fixed  rate  of   
return. Bonds have a senior priority to common stocks in the event the issuer   
is liquidated and interest on bonds is generally paid by the issuer before it   
makes  any  distributions to common stock owners.  Bonds  rated  in  the  two   
highest  rating  categories are considered high quality and  present  minimal   
risk  of  default.  An additional advantage of investing in  U.S.  government   
bonds and Treasury bills is that they are backed by the full faith and credit   
of  the U.S. government and thus have virtually no risk of default.  Although   
government securities fluctuate in price, they are highly liquid.               

Yields for SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account                                     

Yield  and  effective  yield percentages for the SteinRoe  Cash  Income  Sub-   
Account  are  calculated using the method prescribed by  the  Securities  and   
Exchange  Commission.  Both yields reflect the deduction of the annual  1.40%   
asset-based  Certificate charges.  Both yields also reflect, on an  allocated   
basis  after  11/18/97, the Certificate's annual $36 Certificate  Maintenance   
Charge  that  is  collected  after the first Certificate  Anniversary.   Both   
yields  do  not  reflect Contingent Deferred Sales Charges  and  premium  tax   
charges.   The  yields would be lower if these charges  were  included.   The   
following are the standardized formulas:                                        

Yield equals:  (A - B - 1) X  365                                               
C            7                              

Effective Yield Equals:  (A - B)365/7 - 1                                       
C                       
Where:                                                                          

    A =  the Accumulation Unit value at the end of the 7-day period.

       B  =   hypothetical Certificate Maintenance Charge  for  the  7-day
       period.  The assumed annual SteinRoe Cash Income charge is equal to
       the  $36 Certificate charge multiplied by a fraction equal  to  the
       average  number  of  Certificates with SteinRoe  Cash  Income  Sub-
       Account value during the 7-day period divided by the average  total
       number of Certificates during the 7-day period.  This annual amount
       is  converted to a 7-day charge by multiplying it by 7/365.  It  is
       then  equated to an Accumulation Unit size basis by multiplying  it
       by  a  fraction  equal to the average value of  one  SteinRoe  Cash
       Income  Accumulation Unit during the 7-day period  divided  by  the
       average  Certificate  Value  in SteinRoe  Cash  Income  Sub-Account
during the 7-day period.                                    

       C  =   the  Accumulation Unit value at the beginning of  the  7-day
period.                                                     

   The  yield formula assumes that the weekly net income generated  by  an
investment  in  the SteinRoe Cash Income Sub-Account will  continue  over  an   
entire  year.  The effective yield formula also annualizes seven days of  net   
income but it assumes that the net income is reinvested over the year.   This   
compounding effect causes effective yield to be higher than the yield.          

For the 7-day period ended 12/31/96 the yield for the SteinRoe Cash   
Income Sub-Account was 3.71% and the effective yield was 3.78%.

Report of Independent Auditors      

The Board of Directors                                                    
Keyport Life Insurance Company                                            

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Keyport  
Life   Insurance  Company  as  of  December  31,  1996,  and  the   related     
consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for     
the  year  then  ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of    
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility  is to express an opinion on     
these financial statements based on our audit.                                  

We  conducted  our audit in accordance with generally accepted  auditing  
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to     
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free     
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,     
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial     
statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles     
used  and  the  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as     
evaluating  the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe  that     
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                          

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred  to       
above  present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial     
position  of  Keyport Life Insurance Company at December 31, 1996  and  the     
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then     
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.             

As  discussed  in Note 1 to the consolidated financial  statements,   in  
1994,  the Company changed its method of accounting for certain investments     
in debt and equity securities.

KEYPORT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      
December 31, 1996     

1.  Accounting Policies                                                   

Organization                                                              

Keyport  Life  Insurance Company offers a diversified line  of  fixed,
indexed,  and  variable  annuity products designed  to  serve  the  growing     
retirement saving market.  These annuity products are sold through  a  wide     
ranging network of banks, agents, and securities dealers.                       

The  Company  is  a  wholly owned subsidiary  of  Stein  Roe  Services
Incorporated  ("Stein  Roe").  Stein Roe is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of     
Liberty Financial Companies, Incorporated ("Liberty Financial") which is  a     
majority  owned,  indirect subsidiary of Liberty Mutual  Insurance  Company     
("Liberty Mutual").                                                             

Principles of Consolidation                                               

The  consolidated  financial statements include Keyport  Life  Insurance  
Company  and  its wholly owned subsidiaries, Independence Life and  Annuity     
Company  ("Independence Life"), Keyport Advisory Services Corporation,  and     
Keyport Financial Services Corp., (collectively the "Company").                 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  
accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles  which  vary  in     
certain respects from reporting practices prescribed or permitted by  state     
insurance regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions     
and  balances have been eliminated.   Certain prior year amounts have  been     
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.                     

Use of Estimates                                                          

The  preparation  of financial statements in conformity  with  generally  
accepted  accounting principles requires management to make  estimates  and     
assumptions  that  affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements     
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       

Investments                                                               

Effective  January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement  of  Financial  
Accounting  Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments  in  Debt     
and  Equity  Securities"  ("SFAS 115").  Investments  in  debt  and  equity     
securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value,  and     
after-tax  unrealized  gains  and losses (net of  adjustments  to  deferred     
policy acquisition costs and value of insurance in force) are reported as a     
separate  component of stockholder's equity. Realized investment gains  and     
losses are calculated on a first-in, first-out basis.                           

On  December  31,  1995,  pursuant to the "Guide  to  Implementation  of  
Statement  115  on Accounting for Certain Investments in  Debt  and  Equity     
Securities," the Company made a one-time reclassification of certain  fixed     
maturity  securities  from  held to maturity to  available  for  sale.  The     
amortized  cost  of  those  securities at the time  of  transfer  was  $1.4     
billion, and the unrealized gain of $13.9 million was recorded net of taxes     
in stockholder's equity.                                                        

For  the  mortgage backed bond portion of the fixed maturity  investment  
portfolio,  the Company recognizes income using a constant effective  yield     
based  on anticipated prepayments over the estimated economic life  of  the     
security.  When  actual prepayments differ significantly  from  anticipated     
prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments     
to  date  and  anticipated future payments and any resulting adjustment  is     
included in investment income.                                                  

Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost.  Policy loans are  carried  
at the unpaid principal balances plus accrued interest.                         

Fee Income                                                                

Fees  from investment advisory services are recognized as revenues  when  
services  are  provided.  Revenues from fixed and  variable  annuities  and     
single  premium  whole life policies include mortality  charges,  surrender     
charges, policy fees, and contract fees and are recognized when earned.         

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs                                         

Policy  acquisition costs are the costs of acquiring new business  which  
vary  with,  and are primarily related to, the production of new  business.     
Such  costs  include commissions, costs of policy issuance,   underwriting,     
and  selling expenses.  These costs are deferred and amortized in  relation     
to the present value of estimated gross profits from mortality, investment,     
and  expense  margins.  Deferred policy acquisition costs are adjusted  for     
amounts   relating  to  unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  fixed  maturity     
securities  the  Company  has  designated  as  available  for  sale.   This     
adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains     
or  losses  that  is credited or charged directly to stockholder's  equity.     
Deferred policy acquisition costs have been decreased by $103.7 million  at     
December 31, 1996, and decreased by $151.4 million at December 31, 1995 for     
this adjustment.                                                                

Value of Insurance in Force                                               

Value  of  insurance  in  force  represents  the  actuarially-determined  
present  value of projected future gross profits from policies in force  at     
the  date of their acquisition.  This amount is amortized in proportion  to     
the  projected emergence of profits over periods not exceeding 15 years for     
annuities  and  25 years for life insurance.  Interest is  accrued  on  the     
unamortized balance at the contract rate of 5.30%, 5.58% and 5.49%  for the     
years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.                     

The  value of insurance in force is adjusted for amounts relating to the  
recognition  of  unrealized investment gains and losses.  This  adjustment,     
net  of  tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains or losses     
that  is  credited  or charged directly to stockholder's equity.  Value  of     
insurance in force has decreased by $26.0 million at December 31, 1996, and     
decreased by $32.5 million at December 31, 1995 for this adjustment.            

Estimated net amortization expense of the value of insurance in force as  
of  December 31, 1996 is as follows (in thousands): 1997 - $14,237; 1998  -     
$12,206;  1999 - $11,236; 2000 - $10,034; 2001 - $8,582; and  thereafter  -     
$40,506.                                                                        

Intangible Assets                                                         

Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising from business combinations  
accounted  for  as a purchase.  Amortization is provided on a straight-line     
basis over twenty-five years.                                                   

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities                                   

The  assets and liabilities resulting from variable annuity and variable  
life policies are segregated in separate accounts. Separate account assets,     
which  are  carried  at fair value, consist principally of  investments  in     
mutual  funds. Investment income and changes in asset values are  allocated     
to the policyholders, and therefore, do not affect the operating results of     
the  Company.  The Company provides administrative services and  bears  the     
mortality  risk  related to these contracts. As of December  31,  1996  and     
1995, Keyport also classified as separate account assets $73.8 million  and     
$72.5  million,  respectively, of its investments in certain  mutual  funds     
sponsored by affiliates of the Company.                                         

Policy Liabilities                                                        

Policy  liabilities consist of deposits received plus credited interest,  
less accumulated policyholder charges, assessments, and withdrawals related     
to  deferred  annuities  and  single premium whole  life  policies.  Policy     
benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the     
period in excess of related policy account balances.                            

Income Taxes                                                              

Keyport  Life  Insurance Company, Keyport Advisory Services Corporation,  
and  Keyport  Financial  Services Corp. are included  in  the  consolidated     
federal income tax return filed by Liberty Mutual.  Income taxes have  been     
provided  using  the  liability method in accordance  with  SFAS  No.  109,     
"Accounting for Income Taxes," and are calculated as if the companies filed     
their own income tax returns.  Independence Life is required under tax  law     
to file its own federal income tax return.                                      

Cash Equivalents                                                          

Short-term  investments having an original maturity of three  months  or  
less are classified as cash equivalents.                                        

Recent Accounting Pronouncement                                           

In  June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS  No.  
125,  "Accounting  for  Transfers and Servicing  of  Financial  Assets  and     
Extinguishment  of  Liabilities" ("SFAS 125"). The relevant  provisions  of     
SFAS  125  relating to securities lending, dollar rolls, and other  similar     
secured  transactions become effective after December 31, 1997. It  is  not     
expected that the adoption of SFAS 125 will have a material effect  on  the     
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.             

2.  Acquisitions                                                          

On  August  9,  1996,  Keyport entered into a  100  percent  coinsurance  
agreement  for a $954.0 million block of single premium deferred  annuities     
issued  by  Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("F&G Life").  Under     
this  transaction,  the  investment  risk  of  the  annuity  policies   was     
transferred to Keyport.  However, F&G Life will continue to administer  the     
policies  and will remain contractually liable for the performance  of  all     
policy  obligations.  This  transaction  increased  investments  by  $923.1     
million and value of insurance in force by $30.9 million.                       

3.  Investments                                                           

Fixed Maturities                                                          

As  of  December  31,  1996  and 1995, the  Company  did  not  hold  any  
investments in fixed maturities that were classified as held to maturity or     
trading securities.  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and  losses     
and fair value of fixed maturity securities are as follows (in thousands):

Proceeds  from  sales of fixed maturities available for sale  were  $1.7  
billion,  $565.4 million and $927.8 million, for the years  ended  December
31,  1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The sale of fixed maturities  held     
to  maturity  during  1995  and  1994 relate to  certain  securities,  with     
amortized cost of $15.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively, which were     
sold specifically due to a decline in the issuers' credit quality.              

Deferred tax liabilities for the Company's unrealized holding gains  and  
losses,  net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and  value     
of  insurance inforce were $39.5 million and $46.2 million at December  31,
1996 and 1995, respectively.                                                    

No  investment in any person or its affiliates (other than bonds  issued  
by  agencies  of  the  United States government) exceeded  ten  percent  of     
stockholder's equity at December 31, 1996.                                      

At  December 31, 1996, the Company did not have a material concentration  
of  financial  instruments  in a single investee,  industry  or  geographic     
location.                                                                       

At  December  31,  1996, $987.0 million of fixed maturities  were  below  
investment grade.                                                               

4.  Off Balance Sheet Financial Instruments                               

The Company's primary objective in acquiring off balance sheet financial  
instruments  is  the management of interest rate risk. Interest  rate  risk     
results  from  a  mismatch in the timing and amount of invested  asset  and     
policyholder  liability cash flows. The Company seeks to manage  this  risk     
through  various asset/liability management strategies such as the  setting     
of  renewal  rates and by investment portfolio actions designed to  address     
the  interest rate sensitivity of asset cash flows in relation to liability     
cash  flows.  Portfolio actions used to manage interest rate risk primarily     
include  managing  the  effective  duration  of  portfolio  securities  and     
utilizing  interest  rate  swaps and caps. Outstanding  off  balance  sheet     
financial instruments, shown in notional amounts along with their  carrying     
value and  fair values, are as follows (in thousands):

The  interest  rate cap agreements, which expire in 1997  through  2000,  
entitle  the  Company  to  receive  payments  from  the  counterparties  on     
specified future dates, contingent on future interest rates.  For each cap,     
the amount of such payment, if any, is determined by the excess of a market     
interest  rate  over a specified cap rate times the notional  amount.   The     
premium  paid  for  the interest rate caps is included  in  other  invested     
assets  and  is  being amortized over the terms of the  agreements  and  is     
included  in  net investment income.  Interest rate contracts  relating  to     
investments  designated as available for sale are adjusted  to  fair  value     
with  the  resulting unrealized gains and losses included in  stockholder's     
equity.   Fair  values for these contracts are based on current  settlement     
values.   The  current settlement values are based on quoted market  prices     
and  brokerage  quotes,  which utilize pricing  models  or  formulas  using     
current assumptions.                                                            

The Company uses indexed call options for purposes of hedging its equity- 
indexed products.  The call options hedge the interest credited on these 1      
and 5 year term products, which is based on the changes in the Standard &       
Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P Index").  Premiums paid on the     
call  options  are  amortized to interest expense over  the  terms of the       
underlying  equity-indexed products using the straight line method. Gains       
and losses, if any, resulting from the early termination of the call option     
are deferred and amortized to interest credited over the remaining term of      
the underlying equity-indexed products.                                         

At  December  31,  1996 the Company had approximately $73.1  million  of  
unamortized premium in call option contracts.  The call options' maturities     
range from 1997 to 2001.  The Company carries its S&P Index call options at     
market value.                                                                   

Deferred  losses  of $7.9 million and $10.6 million as of  December  31,
1996  and 1995, respectively, resulting from terminated interest rate  swap     
agreements are included with the related fixed maturity securities to which     
the hedge applied and are being amortized over the life of such securities.     

The  Company  is  exposed  to potential credit  loss  in  the  event  of  
nonperformance  by  counterparties  on interest  rate  cap  agreements  and     
interest rate swaps.  Nonperformance is not anticipated and, therefore,  no     
collateral  is  held  or  pledged.  The credit risk associated  with  these     
agreements is minimized by purchasing such agreements from investment-grade     
counterparties.                                                                 

5.  Income Taxes

As  of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately $7.6 million  of  
purchased net operating loss carryforwards (relating to the acquisition  of     
Independence  Life). Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards,     
which  expire through 2006, is limited to use against future profits.   The     
Company  believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize  the     
benefit of its deferred tax assets.                                             

Income taxes paid were $46.9 million, $44.7 million and $28.8 million in  
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.                                              

6.  Retirement Plans                                                      

Keyport  employees  and  certain  employees  of  Liberty  Financial  are  
eligible  to  participate in the Liberty Financial Companies, Inc.  Pension     
Plan  (the "Plan").  It is the Company's practice to fund amounts  for  the     
Plan sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement     
Income Security Act of 1974.  Additional amounts are contributed from  time     
to  time  when  deemed  appropriate by the Company.  Under  the  Plan,  all     
employees  are vested after five years of service.  Benefits are  based  on     
years  of  service,  the  employee's  average  pay  for  the  highest  five     
consecutive  years  during  the  last ten  years  of  employment,  and  the     
employee's  estimated  social  security  retirement  benefit.  Plan  assets     
consist principally of investments in certain mutual funds sponsored by  an     
affiliated company.                                                             

The Company also has an unfunded non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan  
("Supplemental Plan") collectively with the Plan, (the "Plans"), to replace     
benefits  lost  due to limits imposed on Plan benefits under  the  Internal     
Revenue Code.                                                                   

The  following table sets forth the Plans' funded status.  Substantially  
all  the  Plans'  assets  are invested in mutual  funds  sponsored  by  the     
Company.

7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                    

The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used  
to  determine  the fair value of the Company's financial instruments.   The     
aggregate  fair value amounts presented herein do not necessarily represent     
the  underlying  value  of  the Company, and accordingly,  care  should  be     
exercised in deriving conclusions about the Company's business or financial     
condition based on the fair value information presented herein.                 

The  following  methods  and assumptions were used  by  the  Company  in  
determining fair values of financial instruments:                               

Fixed maturities and equity securities:  Fair values for fixed  
maturity  securities  are based on quoted  market  prices,  where     
available.   For fixed maturities not actively traded,  the  fair     
values  are  determined  using values  from  independent  pricing     
services,  or, in the case of private placements, are  determined     
by  discounting expected future cash flows using a current market     
rate applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the     
securities.  The fair values for equity securities are  based  on     
quoted market prices.                                                 

Mortgage   loans:  The  fair  value  of  mortgage  loans   are  
determined  by  discounting future cash flows to the  present  at     
current market rates, using expected prepayment rates.                

Policy  loans:  The carrying value of policy loans approximates 
fair value.                                                           

Other  invested assets, cash:  The carrying value  for  assets  
classified  as other invested assets and cash in the accompanying     
balance sheets approximates their fair value.                         

Policy  liabilities:  Deferred annuity contracts are  assigned  
fair  value  equal  to current net surrender  value.   Annuitized     
contracts  are  valued based on the present value of  the  future     
cash flows at current pricing rates.                                  

The   fair  values  and  carrying  values  of  the  Company's  financial  
instruments are as follows (in thousands):

9.  Statutory Information                                                 

Keyport  is  domiciled  in  Rhode  Island  and  prepares  its  statutory  
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles and practices     
prescribed  or  permitted by the Department of Business Regulation  of  the     
State of Rhode Island.  Statutory surplus differs from stockholder's equity     
reported in accordance with GAAP primarily because policy acquisition costs     
are  expensed when incurred, investment reserves and policy liabilities are     
based  on different assumptions, and income tax expense reflects only taxes     
paid or currently payable.  Keyport's statutory surplus and net income  are     
as follows (in thousands):

10.  Transactions with Affiliated Companies                               

The  Company  reimbursed  Liberty Financial and certain  affiliates  for  
expenses incurred on its behalf for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995     
and   1994.    These  reimbursements  included  corporate,   general,   and     
administrative  expenses, corporate overhead, such as executive  and  legal     
support,  and investment management services.  The total amounts reimbursed     
were  $7.8  million,  $7.6 million and $7.3 million  for  the  years  ended     
December  31,  1996,  1995 and 1994 , respectively.  In  addition,  certain     
affiliated companies distribute the Company's products and were  paid  $6.4     
million, $7.6 million and $15.3 million by the Company for the years  ended     
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.                                

Keyport  has mortgage notes in the original principal amount  of  $100.0  
million  on  properties owned by certain indirect subsidiaries  of  Liberty     
Mutual.  The notes were purchased for their face value. Liberty Mutual  has     
agreed  to  provide credit support to the obligors under these  notes  with     
respect  to  certain  payments of principal and interest  thereon.   As  of     
December 31, 1996 and 1995, the amounts outstanding were $39.5 million.         

 Dividend payments to Liberty Financial from the Company are  governed
by  insurance laws which restrict the maximum amount of dividends that  may     
be  paid without prior approval of the Department of Business Regulation of     
the State of Rhode Island.  As of December 31, 1996, the maximum amount  of     
dividends  (based  on  statutory  surplus  and  statutory  net  gains  from     
operations) which may be paid by Keyport was approximately $42.5 million.       

11. Commitments and Contingencies                                         

Leases:  The  Company  leases data processing equipment,  furniture  and  
certain  office facilities from others under operating leases  expiring  in     
various  years  through  2001. Rental expense (in  thousands)  amounted  to     
$3,213,  $3,221 and $3,011 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995  and     
1994,  respectively. For each of the next five years, and in the aggregate,

$   13,894                                  

Legal  Matters: The Company is involved at various times  in  litigation  
common  to its business. In the opinion of management, provisions made  for     
potential losses are adequate and the resolution of  any such litigation is     
not  expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financial     
condition or its results of operations.                                         

Regulatory  Matters: Under existing guaranty fund laws  in  all  states,  
insurers  licensed  to  do business in those states  can  be  assessed  for     
certain  obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders  and     
claimants. The actual amount of such assessments will depend upon the final     
outcome of rehabilitation proceedings and will be paid over several  years.     
In  1996,  1995 and 1994, Keyport was assessed $10.0 million, $8.1 million,     
and  $7.7  million,  respectively. During  1996,  1995  and  1994,  Keyport     
recorded  $1.0  million,  $2.0 million, and $7.2 million  respectively,  of     
provisions  for state guaranty fund association expense.  At  December  31,
1996 and 1995, the reserve for such assessments was $12.9 million and $21.9     
million, respectively.                                                          

Report of Independent Auditors    

To the Board of Directors of Keyport Life Insurance Company                     
and Contract Owners of Variable Account A                                   

We  have  audited  the accompanying statement of assets  and  liabilities  of   
Keyport Life Insurance Company - Variable Account A as of December 31,  1996,   
and  the  related statement of operations and changes in net assets  for  the   
period  from  January 30, 1996 (commencement of operations) to  December  31,
1996.   These  financial statements are the responsibility  of  Keyport  Life   
Insurance Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an  opinion   
on these financial statements based on our audit.                               

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  auditing   
standards.   Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to   
obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are  free   
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on  a  test  basis,   
evidence  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.   
An   audit  also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and   
significant  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the  overall   
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that  our  audit  provides  a   
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all  material  respects,  the financial position of  Keyport  Life  Insurance   
Company  -  Variable Account A at December 31, 1996 and the  results  of  its   
operations  and  changes in net assets for the period from January  30,  1996   
(commencement  of  operations)  to December  31,  1996,  in  conformity  with   
generally accepted accounting principles.

Variable  Account A (the "Variable Account"), was established on January  30,
1996  as  a  segregated investment account of Keyport Life Insurance  Company   
(the "Company").  The Variable Account is registered with the Securities  and   
Exchange  Commission as a Unit Investment Trust under the Investment  Company   
Act of 1940 and invests in shares of eligible funds.  The Variable Account is   
a  funding vehicle for group and individual variable annuity contracts.   The   
Variable Account currently offers two contracts, distinguished principally by   
the level of expenses, surrender charges, and eligible fund options.  The two   
contracts and their respective eligible fund options are as follows:

changed to Colonial-Keyport U.S. Stock Fund.                                    

2.  Significant Accounting Policies                                             

The  accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance  with   
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP").   The  preparation  of   
financial  statements  in conformity with GAAP requires  management  to  make   
estimates  and  assumptions that affect amounts reported  therein.   Although   
actual  results  could differ from these estimates, any such differences  are   
expected to be immaterial to the Variable Account.                              

Shares of the eligible funds are sold to the Variable Account at the reported   
net  asset values.  Transactions are recorded on the trade date.  Income from   
dividends is recorded on the ex-dividend date.  Realized gains and losses  on   
sales  of  investments are computed on the basis of identified  cost  of  the   
investments sold.                                                               

Amounts due to Keyport Life Insurance Company represent mortality and expense   
risk charges earned by the Company in 1996 but not transferred to the Company   
until January 1997.                                                             

The operations of the Variable Account are included in the federal income tax   
return  of the Company, which is taxed as a Life Insurance Company under  the   
provisions  of  the  Internal Revenue Code.  The Company anticipates  no  tax   
liability  resulting from the operations of the Variable Account.  Therefore,   
no provision for income taxes has been charged against the Variable Account.    

3.  Expenses                                                                    

Keyport Advisor Variable Annuity                                                
There are no deductions made from purchase payments for sales charges at  the   
time  of  purchase.   In  the event of a contract termination,  a  contingent   
deferred  sales charge, based on a graded table of charges, is deducted.   An   
annual  contract  maintenance charge of $36 to cover  the  cost  of  contract   
administration is deducted from each contractholder's account on the contract   
anniversary  date.   Daily  deductions are made  from  each  sub-account  for   
assumption of mortality and expense risk at an effective annual rate of 1.25%   
of  contract  value.   A daily deduction is also made for distribution  costs   
incurred  by  the  Company at an effective annual rate of 0.15%  of  contract   
value.                                                                          

Manning & Napier Variable Annuity                                               
There are no deductions from purchase payments for sales charges at the  time   
of  purchase.   There  are  also  no contingent  deferred  sales  charges  or   
distribution charges.  An annual contract maintenance charge of $35 to  cover   
the  cost  of  contract administration is deducted from each contractholder's   
account  on  the contract anniversary date.  Daily deductions are  made  from   
each sub-account for assumption of mortality and expense risk at an effective   
annual rate of 0.35% of contract value.                                         

4.  Affiliated Company Transactions                                             

Administrative  services necessary for the operation of the Variable  Account   
are  provided  by  the Company.  The Company has absorbed all  organizational

7.  Diversification Requirements                                                

Under the provisions of Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, a          
variable annuity contract, other than a contract issued in connection with      
certain types of employee benefit plans, will not be treated as an annuity      
contract for federal tax purposes for any period for which the investments of   
the segregated asset account on which the contract is based are not             
adequately diversified.  The Code provides that the "adequately diversified"    
requirement may be met if the underlying investments satisfy either a           
statutory safe harbor test or diversification requirements set forth in         
regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury.                                

The Internal Revenue Service has issued regulations under Section 817(h) of     
the Code.  Keyport Life Insurance Company believes that the Variable Account    
satisfies the current requirements of the regulations, and it intends that      
the Variable Account will continue to meet such requirements.

 KEYPORT VARIABLE ACCOUNT A/MA (Form: 497, Received: 06/13/2006 12:23:55) 













	SUN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA (U.S.)

	SUPPLEMENT DATED JUNE 12, 2006

	TO


	PROSPECTUSES DATED MAY 1, 2006

	FOR KEYPORT CHARTER AND KEYPORT LATITUDE,


	TO PROSPECTUS DATED APRIL 30, 2004

	FOR KEYPORT VISTA,


	AND TO PROSPECTUS DATED DECEMBER 31, 2003

	FOR KEYPORT OPTIMA


	ISSUED BY KEYPORT VARIABLE ACCOUNT A



	This supplement describes proposed changes to the certain investment options offered under your Certificate. Please retain this supplement with your Prospectus for future reference.


	On April 19, 2006, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life"), Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York ("Sun Life NY"), and their various separate accounts filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") seeking an order approving the substitution of certain classes of shares of a portfolio of the Sun Capital Advisers Trust (the "New Portfolio") for certain classes of shares of a portfolio of the


	AllianceBernstein Variable Products Series Fund, Inc. (the "Old Portfolio").


	More specifically, the effect of the proposed substitution would be to replace the Old Portfolio with the New Portfolio as an investment option under your Certificate, as follows:











	Old Portfolio






	New Portfolio







	Class B Shares of the AllianceBernstein VP Large Cap Growth Portfolio of the AllianceBernstein Fund





	Service Class Shares of the SC


	FI


	Large Cap Growth Fund


	of the Sun Capital Trust











	Sun Life and Sun Life NY will carry out the proposed substitution by redeeming the applicable share class of the Old Portfolio and purchasing the applicable share class of the New Portfolio. Any Certificate value that you have allocated to a Sub-account investing in the applicable share class of an Old Portfolio on the date of the substitution will, in effect, be transferred to the Sub-account investing in the applicable share class of the New Portfolio. Sun Life and Sun Life NY anticipate that, if SEC approval is granted and all of the systems needed to perform the substitution are in place, the proposed substitution will occur in October 2006. To the extent required by law, approvals of the proposed substitution also will be obtained from the state insurance regulators in certain jurisdictions.


	From April 19, 2006 through 30 days following the substitution, you may make one


	transfer of Certificate Value from the Sub-account investing in the Old Portfolio (before the substitutions) or the New Portfolio (after the substitution) to any other available Sub-account without being assessed a transfer fee and without that transfer counting against limitations on transfers permitted under your Certificate. In addition, until at least 30 days after the substitution, neither Sun Life nor Sun Life NY will exercise any rights it may have under your Certificate to impose restrictions or charges on transfers into or out of the Old Portfolio (except as are necessary to prevent short-term trading activities).


	The following discussion sets out brief information about the New Portfolio. All Certificate Owners will receive a current prospectus for the New Portfolio prior to the substitution. This prospectus will describe the New Portfolio's investment policies, risks, fees and expenses, and all other aspects of its operations, and should be read carefully before investing.

	There is no assurance that the New Portfolio will achieve its stated objective.








	SC FI Large Cap Growth Fund of the Sun Capital Advisers Trust





	Investment Objective.


	To seek long-term growth of capital.




	Management Fees and Estimated Other Expenses for the Year Ended December 31, 2005

	(as an annual percentage of average daily net assets)


	1














	Service Class







	Management Fees





	0.75%







	12b-1 Fees





	0.25%







	Other Expenses





	0.30%







	Total Operating Expenses





	1.30%







	Less Expense Waivers and Reimbursements






	(0.24%)







	Net Operating Expenses





	1.06%







	If you have any questions about the proposed substitutions, please call our Service Center at (800) 725-7215 or write to us at P.O. Box 9133, Wellesley Hills, MA 02481.


	 


	 



	THIS SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE READ AND RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	__________________________


	1



	Because the SC FI Large Cap Growth Fund was not operational as of December 31, 2005, the expenses in the table are estimates. The adviser to the SC FI Large Cap Growth Fund has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and, if necessary, to limit other ordinary operating expenses so that total operating expenses, as a percentage of average net assets, do not exceed 1.06% for the Service Class.

Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company: No-Action letter dated December 19, 2003














Home | Previous Page





























 
Securities Act of 1933 - Section 5 and Rule 145
Investment Company Act of 1940 - Section 8 and 11
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company
December 19, 2003


RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport


DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Life Insurance Company


Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 19, 2003, and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life") or Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts ("Keyport Accounts") to Sun Life in connection with the proposed merger of Sun Life and Keyport (the "Merger").  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if: (1) the change in depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Accounts are filed by Sun Life and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport contracts after the Merger is effected.
Similarly, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts ("MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the relevant MVA Contracts, and Sun Life assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such contracts.
Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.  Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusion on the issues presented.

Re:	Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company
Dear Mr. Kotapish:
We are writing on behalf of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life (U.S.)") and Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport:

under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, and Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts, registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts, to Sun Life (U.S.) (the "Transfers") by operation of law in the proposed merger of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport (the "Merger"), as described below; and 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Keyport MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life (U.S.) assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and Sun Life (U.S.) assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such Contracts (the "MVA Transfer"), as described below (the Merger, the Transfers, and the MVA Transfer, and any related transactions are referred to collectively as the "Merger").

In the past, the Commission's staff has granted requests for similar relief.  For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the relief requested here also should be granted.
I.	BACKGROUND
A.	Description of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport
Sun Life (U.S.) is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 12, 1970.1  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Sun Life (U.S.) issues individual and group life insurance policies and annuity contracts and is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Sun Life (U.S.) had assets of approximately $20 billion.
Sun Life (U.S.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Holdings, Inc. ("Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings").  The ultimate parent of Sun Life (U.S.) and Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings is Sun Life Financial Inc. (formerly known as Sun Life Financial Services of Canada, Inc.), a Canadian corporation with common shares listed on the Toronto, New York, and Philippines stock exchanges.
Keyport is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of Rhode Island in 1957.  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Keyport issues individual and group annuity contracts and formerly issued individual life insurance policies.  Keyport is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Keyport had assets of approximately $19.6 billion.  Keyport is a wholly owned subsidiary Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, and is therefore under common control with Sun Life (U.S.).
B.	Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and Related Contracts
Sun Life (U.S.) has 20 registered separate accounts (the "Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts"), which fund variable life insurance contracts or variable annuity contracts (collectively, the "Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts").  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Delaware insurance law, and each is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act2 as a unit investment trust or as an open-end, diversified management investment company.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts supported by the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts which are registered as unit investment trusts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.  In addition, certain Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a fixed account investment option that is registered under the 1933 Act.
Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Clarendon"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, is the principal underwriter for the Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.  Clarendon is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Sun Life (U.S.).
C.	Keyport Accounts and Related Contracts
Keyport has three registered separate accounts (the "Keyport Accounts"):  KMA Variable Account, which funds one variable annuity contract; Variable Account A, which funds 10 variable annuity contracts; and Keyport Variable Account I, which funds one variable life insurance contract.  The Keyport Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Rhode Island insurance law, and each is registered as a unit investment trust with the Commission under the 1940 Act.   The variable contracts supported by the Keyport Accounts (the "Keyport Variable Contracts") are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.3  The Keyport Accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Keyport Variable Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.4  Certain Keyport Variable Contracts also offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.
Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Keyport, is the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.  KFSC is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Keyport.  Following the Merger, it is planned that Clarendon will act as the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.
D.	Keyport MVA Contracts
The Keyport MVA Contracts are fixed account annuity contacts, comprised of group and individual single premium annuity contracts (the "Single Premium MVA Contracts") and group and individual flexible premium annuity contracts (the "Flexible Premium MVA Contracts").  The Keyport MVA Contracts offer two general account options, one of which is subject to a market value adjustment provision.  The Keyport MVA Contracts have no variable investment option.
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Single Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Keyport no longer offers the Single Premium MVA Contracts, is not accepting additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts, and is not filing post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.5
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.6  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among the general account options, subject to certain conditions.
The Keyport MVA Contracts, together with the Keyport Variable Contacts, are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Keyport Contracts."
II.	THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
A.	The Merger
Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings conducts insurance and related operations through various direct and indirect, wholly owned insurance companies, including Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport.  It proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs.  To that end, it intends to combine the operations of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport through the Merger.  In June 2003, Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Keyport will merge with and into Sun Life (U.S.) leaving Sun Life (U.S.) as the surviving company.  The Merger, including the Transfers, the MVA Transfer, and related transactions, has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport and  each party's sole shareholder.  The parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the Merger become effective on December 31, 2003.7
Upon the effective date of the Merger ("Effective Date"), Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of Keyport and will become directly liable for Keyport's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Keyport Contracts then outstanding.  Each Keyport Contract owner will become a contract owner of Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Keyport Contracts.  Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Keyport Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Keyport Contracts.  The net unit value of the Keyport Accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers.  The Merger Agreement will not affect the current owners of Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and the Keyport Accounts (collectively, the "Accounts") are not parties to the Merger Agreement, which will be entered into at the insurance company level.  As a result of the Merger, the Accounts, which are registered under the 1940 Act, will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law.  The Accounts will not be merged into one another.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated.  Each sub-account of the Keyport Accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.
The Merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts (collectively, the "Funds").  The Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction.  The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.  No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Funds, the Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, although the principal underwriter for Keyport may change after the Merger, the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings.
Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport have determined that no provision of the Keyport Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts (the "Keyport Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger.  Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Keyport Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Keyport Contract owners under the 1940 Act.  In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Keyport Contracts will not change, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will become the depositor of the Keyport Accounts.  Consequently, Keyport Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.
All direct and indirect costs of the Merger will be borne by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport and not by any owners of Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport Contracts.
B.	The Transfers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the Keyport Accounts will transfer intact to Sun Life (U.S.) and become part of Sun Life (U.S.) on the Effective Date.  Each transferred Keyport Account will change its name, and have Sun Life (U.S.) as its depositor rather than Keyport.  No other changes to the Keyport Accounts will result from the Merger.
The assets and liabilities that comprise the Keyport Accounts immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Sun Life (U.S.), as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, the Keyport Accounts will continue to fund the same Keyport Contracts they did immediately prior to the Merger.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.8  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Keyport Variable Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
C.	The MVA Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts to Sun Life (U.S.), and Sun Life (U.S.) will assume Keyport's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date.  As a result of the Merger, each non-unitized separate account of Keyport that funds the Keyport MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Sun Life (U.S.).  At the same time, Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Keyport under the Keyport MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger.
The MVA Transfer will not change the terms of the Keyport MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) as the insurer under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Flex Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered.  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Flex Premium MVA Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
Sun Life (U.S.) does not intend to offer additional Single Premium MVA Contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts or file post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.
D.	Procedural Matters
Sun Life (U.S.) will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  The registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the Merger and reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s sponsorship of the Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger, but will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all Keyport Contract owners.
Sun Life (U.S.) also will file a new registration statement on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The new registration statement will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport with respect to the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Keyport MVA Contract at the time of the MVA Transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
Following the Effective Date, Sun Life (U.S.) will not make offers or accept payments under the Keyport Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III.	ANALYSIS
A.	Introduction
As discussed more fully below, it is our view, with regard to the proposed Merger (including the Transfers and the MVA Transfer), that: (1) Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder are inapplicable to the Merger, and no registration statements on Form N-14 are required; (2) Section 8 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger; and (3) Section 11 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger, but if Section 11 is viewed as applicable to the Merger transactions, the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Neither Sun Life (U.S.) nor Keyport seeks no-action reassurance under Section 17(a) or Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act with respect to the Transfers.9
In support of our views, we note that the proposed Merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous no-action requests, seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the 1933 Act and 1940 Act noted above, to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products.10  In connection with the relief sought in this request, the proposed Merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions.
B.	Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 Thereunder Are Inapplicable to the Transfers and the MVA Transfer
1.	Transfers
In our view, the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the Keyport Accounts and co-issuer of the Keyport Variable Contracts, pursuant to the Transfers and any related transactions, will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or Rule 145 thereunder.  Rule 145, an interpretive rule adopted by the Commission, provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization.11
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,12  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any material change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the sponsor/depositor will be different.  These previously issued no-action letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above: two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the Keyport Accounts will remain intact after the Merger and the assets of each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name) investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the Keyport Contracts.  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.) (which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a Keyport Account under the 1940 Act), will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that cause them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Variable Contracts, which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets).13 
As discussed above, the Merger is not subject, by either state law or federal securities law, to the vote or consent of the Contract owners of either Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport.  There is no material change to the security aspect of the Keyport Variable Contracts issued by Keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the Contract owners as a result of the Merger.  The only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred Keyport Accounts and the assumption of existing Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.).  Since there will be no vote of the Contact owners relating to a new investment decision, or otherwise, Rule 145 does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned no-action letters.14   Based on the foregoing, we have concluded that neither Section 5 of the 1933 Act nor Rule 145 thereunder is applicable to the proposed Transfers and any related transactions.
Moreover, with respect to registration statements under the 1933 Act, we believe that no registration statement on Form N-14 will be required to be filed in connection with the Merger.15  Nonetheless, we believe that the registration statements for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts issued through each Keyport Account, as separate accounts of Sun Life (U.S.), need to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Keyport Variable Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file new registration statements with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts, which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
These new registration statements, which will be filed on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, will reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected, and will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Keyport Variable Contracts after the Merger.16   Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Keyport Variable Contracts would have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
2.	MVA Transfer
In our view, the MVA Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Keyport MVA Contracts by virtue of the MVA Transfer, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will succeed Keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Keyport MVA Contracts.  These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Keyport will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts intact to Sun Life (U.S.).  Consequently, when the MVA Transfer becomes effective, Sun Life (U.S.) will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger (including the MVA Transfer) and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options.  Consequently, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the MVA Transfer.
We believe, however, that the registration statement for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts needs to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Flexible Premium MVA Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file a new registration statement with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts, which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
The new registration statement, which will be filed on Form S-3, will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of Keyport's contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectus will be sent to all owners of Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts after the Merger.  Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Flexible Premium MVA Contracts will have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
C.	Section 8 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Transfer of the Keyport Accounts.
It is our view that the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act, and, therefore, can, and should, be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act.  The filing of these amendments with the Commission will be made as part of the process of filing new 1933 Act registration statements discussed above for the Keyport Contracts.  These amendments will reflect Sun Life (U.S.) as the depositor of the Keyport Accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from Keyport to Sun Life (U.S.) as of the Effective Date.  This procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.
The proposed Merger will cause a change in the depositor for the Keyport Accounts, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the Keyport Contracts.  The resulting change in the depositor due to the Transfers of the Keyport Accounts, however, will not change the structure or operations of the Keyport Accounts or the relationship of the Keyport Accounts to their depositor or to the Keyport Contract owners.  The Keyport Accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts, accordingly, will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act on the Effective Date, as discussed above.
D.	Section 11 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Merger.
Based on the analysis set forth above relating to Section 5 of the 1933 Act, it also is our view that the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions, will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.  Nonetheless, should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11 of the 1940 Act, we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Accordingly, Commission approval should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with effecting the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions.
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,17  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the depositor will change.  These previously issued no-action letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above: two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact, and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the assets in each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name).  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.), the Keyport Variable Contracts will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that caused them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Contracts).18 
IV.	NO-ACTION REQUEST
In view of these circumstances, we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Transfers and the MVA Transfer or under Sections 8 and 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Transfers, if the Merger is effect as described herein.  In addition, we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any action if: (1) the change in the depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements for the transferred Keyport Contracts under the 1933 Act are filed by Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport Contracts after the Merger is effected.
If you have any question or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me at (202) 965- 8152 or Joan Boros at (202) 965-8150.

Very truly yours,

4 Keyport has ceased offering certain Keyport Variable Contracts, although those Contracts continue to permit additional payments and to allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.  See note 3, supra.  Keyport does not file annual post-effective amendments or distribute updated prospectuses to existing Contract owners with respect to these Contracts in reliance on prior Commission staff no-action positions.  See Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company (pub. avail. Oct. 23, 1990).
5 KeySelect Annuity Contracts (File No. 333-01783).
6 KeyIndex Flex Annuity Contracts (File No. 333-13609).
7 Regulatory approval of the Merger is necessary in three states.  The Merger has been approved by the state insurance regulators in Delaware and Rhode Island, the domiciliary states of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport, respectively, and by the California Department of Insurance.
8 See note 3, supra.  Sun Life (U.S.) currently has no plans to develop and offer additional types of variable contracts through the Keyport Accounts after the Merger.
9 On a number of previous occasions, the Commission staff has been asked to provide no-action assurances (which the staff has granted) under Sections 17(a) and 17(d) of the 1940 Act in situations when insurance companies merged and transferred separate accounts in connection with the merger.  See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 17, 1996); Intramerica Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 29, 1992); California-Western States Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 9, 1991); UNUM Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 24, 1991); Lincoln National Pension Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 29, 1988); and American General Life Ins. Co. of Delaware (pub. avail. Mar. 13, 1986).  The staff has stated in these no-action letters that neither Section 17(a) nor Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act is applicable in the case of a transaction, like the present one. The staff further stated in Metropolitan Life that it does not intend to issue additional no-action letters in this area absent novel facts and circumstances.  We do not believe that novel facts or circumstances are present with respect to the Transfers and the factors discussed in the forgoing letters.
10 See, e.g., Allstate Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 23, 2002); Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Co. of New York (pub. avail. Dec. 20, 2002); The Manufacturers Life In. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 27, 2001); Aid Association for Lutherans/Lutheran Brotherhood (pub. avail. Dec. 21, 2001); Jefferson Pilot Financial Ins. Co., Alexander Hamilton Life Ins. Co. of America (pub. avail. Aug. 1, 2002); AUSA Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Sept. 18, 1998).
11 Rule 145 under the 1933 Act may apply when there is submitted to security holders for a vote or consent a plan or agreement for, among other things, "a statutory merger or consolidation or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation or other person held by such security holders will become or be exchanged for securities of any other person."  According to the Preliminary Note to Rule 145, "the thrust of the Rule is that an 'offer,' 'offer to sell,' 'offer for sale,' or 'sale' occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security."
12 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
13 The Merger will affect only the insurance aspects of the Keyport Contracts  (i.e., the insurance company guaranteeing the death benefit and certain other contractual rights) and will not affect those aspects that cause the Keyport Contracts to be treated as securities (e.g., the cash surrender value and investment options available through the Keyport Accounts).
14 See the no-action letters cited in note 10 and the accompanying text to note  11, supra.
15 We note that the Form N-14 registration statement, by its terms, does not apply to separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts.
16 While new registration statements will be filed for certain Keyport Variable Contracts that Keyport has ceased offering, Sun Life (U.S.) will rely on prior Commission no-action positions in discontinuing filing post-effective amendments and delivering updated prospectuses to existing owners of these Contracts.  See Great-West, supra note 4.  We are not requesting any no-action assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport on these prior staff positions.
17 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
18 See the accompanying text to note 13, supra.

										In October 1987, I was sold a retirement annuity product by an unqualified Investment Advisor employee of Huntington National Banks, Columbus, Ohio USA.  This product was the Keyport Life Insurance Company "Keyport Advisor" 7-Year Annuity.  The Keyport Life Insurance Company products were purchased by Sun Life Financial Services, Inc. (Toronto, Canada and Wellesley, MA USA) in 2001.  Sun Life Financial Services, Wellesley MA continues to market and manage Keyport Annuity products. 
I invested over $164,000 of retirement funds in the Keyport Advisor Annuity. I was promised (written and verbal by Huntington Banks and Keyport Life Insurance Company): (a) unlimited potential for aggressive growth; (b) a high degree of financial investment flexibility; and (c) highly competent financial investment services support.  
Once receiving the Keyport Advisor Annuity contract, I found out that I could not cancel this contract for at least seven years without a large penalty ($11,340 to $1,600 penalty, depending upon years from purchase).  Further, I found out that this product was commonly suggested by local bank investment officers to banking clients due to the higher than average sales commissions paid. 
Over time, I realized that NO PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSISTANCE of any kind was available from Huntington National Banks, Keyport Life Insurance Company, or Sun Life Financial Services.  Approximately every 6 months, I was mailed prospectuses from 7-14 mutual fund, stock fund or money market fund products in which I could chose to invest.   
Over several years, it became apparent that the only funds available were of very low quality and rating, and in many cases showed consistent losses over the period of my investment (1987-2003).  Never, in seven years, were stock or mutual fund products made available that were listed among the 500 top performers in the US in any category. For example, the only money market fund available always paid less than similar money market funds available through local banks.  Following the 9/11 World Trade Center tragedy, Keyport continued to offer funds whose professional fund management staffs had been killed. Additionally, a service fee of over 1% was assessed to my accounts every year.   
When I attempted to seek professional assistance from Keyport Life Insurance Company, I was treated rudely or ignored by the company customer service staff, and on several occasions was threatened by the legal staff of Keyport in writing for my efforts to remove my funds from the annuity without penalty.  On several occasions, I was told by telephone customer service personnel employed by Keyport Life Insurance Company that they did not understand why any serious investor would purchase a Keyport Annuity product. 
In my initial contract, I was allowed to transfer my funds among the few available stock, mutual fund and money market products at any time, without cost.  When the stock market became increasingly volatile, I received a letter indicating that Keyport had decided to change the contract, such that money could be transferred only every 30 days.  Thus, if another terrorist tragedy occurred, Keyport investors would be unable to remove their investment from stock-based products for up to 30 additional days. This change was made based a "fine print" sentence in the original contract indicating, in essence, that Keyport retained the "right to alter the contract of investors in any way they deemed suitable, without prior notification of investors". 
While the stock market increased from approximately 5500 in 1987 to a high of over 12000, I realized a total investment gain of 8.74% in six years, or an average gain of 1.45% per year.  When I finally withdrew my money following the sixth year, I was penalized over $1600. I estimate conservatively, based on the performances of other available products, that the Keyport Advisor Annuity cost me over $80,000 in potential investment gain. 
Based on my experience, I strongly urge that no serious investor consider investment in Keyport annuity products.  While there are many credible investment products on the market, the Keyport Annuity, now marketed and managed by Sun Life Financial Services, proved to be among the poorest possible. I further suggest that the advice of poorly trained and experienced investment employees of banks be ignored, as their actions may be more driven by commissions that by a thorough investigation of the historical performance of available investment products.

														Just a few comments of clarification...... 
I do not work for Keyport but I am an agent who sells variable annuities. Something that is very frustrating in this business is not only cleaning up the messes of inadequate fellow advisors but more so the ignorance I see amongst clients. I very rarely see a client participate in the education of the product that they are purchasing.  
I constantly see the eyes "roll over" so to speak as I'm outlining the details of a particular investment.Some of these products are not rocket science but can be a little complicated and require the consumer's concentration.I demand that my clients know their products inside an out whether they like it or not (and because of situations like this letter).  
When I came across this complaint I truly felt the need to clarify some differences between being "ripped off" and being a consumer who was affected by unfortunate market timing and lack of product understanding(as to not mislead consumers).  
Nothing in the complaint truly had anything to do with "Keyport Finanical" (although the investments that they offer in their subaccounts are not outstanding they still had average 10 year return of 5-8% annually) or "SunLife" itself. First of all....a 1% service fee (industry standard) is a percentage of your returns that is retained for portfolio management costs- not unfair OR abnormal from any variable annuity or mutual fund.  
Secondly....subaccounts are chosen at purchase, at which time each fund available for investment within the annuity is disclosed to the client- YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO RESEARCH THESE SUBACCOUNTS (you even have to sign for them-which is something that should never be done without regard). 
Their avarage annual yields are even made available to you with your materials. If these returns are not to a clients satisfaction it would be at this time BEFORE purchasing the contract to decide you would like to look into an alternative annuity (with funds that offer higher return potential). Money markets within mutual fund companies and variable annuities are NOT (I repeat NOT) meant to be competitive or compared to bank money markets EVER. They are not the same thing. If you are looking for short term liquid cash by all means go to a bank and do not purchase one through a VA-you will be disappointed. They serve a specific purpose for each unique investor but generally get used as a vehicle for avoiding market fluctuation (as a part of an overall strategy for your portfolio). 
Also, transferring between these investments more than once in a 30 day period is  excessive ("referred to as market timing"). You cannot time the market-simple but the hardest idea for investors to comprehend. Even in the middle of the World Trade disaster the worst thing for an investor to do is panic and sell all their stocks (something that was becoming an epidemic which is why many companies including Keyport put limitations on excessive trading/market timing). 
Third....the fact that the seven year term/surrender schedule was not realized until after the contract was received in the mail is a huge sign that this particular investor didn't pay attention to what he was purchasing. The first thing I would want to know when I'm investing is..what is my commitment on time? Is it liquid?  
Can I withdraw whenever I need to? And the bottom line is.....the regulatory agencies who govern the purchases of these contracts require that all this information be disclosed on the application before purchase and signed by the client. These complaintts listed in the letter all could have been avoided by asking questions and paying attention to the annuity application being signed. These things are not hidden and NOT difficult to find. Again, its not rocket science. Last.....unfortunately with the declining period in the stock market alot of investors felt burned.  
Even ones who knew the "market risks" that were being taken on but when reality struck and we finally did go through a bear market it left a bitter taste in consumers mouths. Stories like the one in this letter do a gross diservice to consumers who can benefit from variable annuities/mutual funds (but unfortunately hear stories like these and do not understand that the fault isn't with the product but the person who didn't take the time to understand it). Lesson learned should be...PAY ATTENTION.  
Like I tell my clients, if you don't comprehend the product then go over it until you do (ask me again,go to a family member you trust, get a second opinion, call the company or ask a friend-anything). I think our investments deserve as much attention as the cars we buy!!!!! You don't buy a car and let your eyes glaze over when the sales person is talking about annual interest, warranties or gallons per mile. Then why do that with your nest egg?

the first conclusion is that buying an independent agency 
and continuing to operate it as such is a failed strategy. 
Why would you go into a business that 84,000 other firms 
have exited, mostly not by choice, over the last 15 or 20 
years? And so, on the surface, you would say this is a very 
unattractive business to be in.â 

Because of rising technology costs, small agencies 
can ât be competitive. 

The small âMom and Popâ propertykasualty agencies 
are fading away. And most large propertykasualty agen- 
cies werenât attractive for Taskerâs bank client, because of 
the issues the agencies had to deal with to make their 
financials work. They also werenât agood fit for the bankâs 
strengths. 

Finding the bright spot 

want to buy a propertykasualty agency? 
So with all these gloomy facts, why should a bank 

âThere is a segment of that business that is very 
healthy,â Tasker explained. âAnd thatâs typically those 100 
to 200, relatively large independent property and casualty 
brokerage firms. And just to give you aquick profile, many 
of these firms are historically, over the last ten years, 
growing on an internal new business rate of 20 percent to 
25 percent a year. Theyâre historically very acquisitive 
themselves. They have very strong relationships with their 
carriers. Theyâre profitable. Theyâre better managed than 
what their counterparts were in the early part of the â70s and 
â80s. And so, thereâs avery strong segment that is profitable 
and productive, by and large. 

âAnd so, if you were looking at this as an entry strategy, 
then the strategic acquisition would be obviously of a f m  that 
is of size, and has some strength to it, some longevity to it. 

âAnd then, the last conclusion we reached - again, 
assuming that you still want to be in this business after all 
of the negatives - is to not overlook the opportunity for 
second and third tier acquisitions. Initially, you can acquire 
a mid-sized brokerage firm. After that, there can be a 
significant potential to continue to grow that firm, by 
acquiring smaller firms in the future.â

NEW KEYPORT V.A. IS FOR THE FEE-WARY 
CUSTOMER 

eyport Life Insurance Company (Boston, MA) has 
jumped on the cost-reduction bandwagon by intro- K ducing a variable annuity with no surrender charge 

or annual maintenance fee. 
The new product, called Advisor Vista, is targeted at 

bank customers who are concerned about having enough 
retirement income, but wary of traditional annuity charges 
and fees. 

But what prompted Keyport to introduce a product 
with these features now? 

Put off by surrender charges 
âWell, it was acouple of things,â said Stephen Bonner, 

executive vice president with Keyport. âNumber one, we 
saw some similar products in the market. And number two, 
we perceived that there is a segment of the market that will 
value this type of a product configuration. And we think 
that, in part, there are some folks who just are put off by the 
structure of a product with surrender charges - their time 

horizons are shorter. Or even if their time horizons are 
longer, they just donât want to accept that kind of barrier 
between them and liquidity.â 

More and more customers don ât want topay surrender 
fees. 

For many annuities, the customer must pay a surrender 
charge if he wants to convert the annuity to cash before year 
seven. More and more consumers apparently donât like that. 

âThey may be people who just value liquidity,â Bonner 
suggested. âIt may just open up a whole segment of the 
market - people who have not purchased annuities be- 
cause they just donât like that liquidity feature. They may 
be people who have bought annuities before, who have 
already lived through a surrender charge period, and are 
looking for a more up-to-date place to put their money. Then

OCTOBER 1998 



they donât feel that they should have to incur another 
surrender charge period as part of the product. So we felt that 
it made sense to take a hard look at it.â 

What do surrender charges typically average on a vari- 
able annuity these days? 

âI think the typical thing that you see,â Bonner re- 
sponded, âis 7 percent in the first year, and then declining 1 
percent each additional year. So it is 6 percent in the second 
year, 5 percent in the third, and so on.â 

That might deter people who are new to annuities. 
âThere is obviously a lot of volatility out there,â Bonner 

admitted. âAnd while hopefully the products are sold as long 
term products, a lot of people are just nervous about putting 
barriers between them and their liquidity.â 

But how important are the no-surrender charge and no 
maintenance fee charge features for bank customers? 

âWe think,â Bonner responded, âthat they are poten- 
tially important, again to certain segments of the bank 
population - the segments who are resistant to surrender 
charges, either because they just donât like them or because 
theyâve already paid a surrender charge. It might have been 
in an SPDA [Single Premium Deferred Annuity] or other 
annuity. Theyâve lived through the surrender period and now 
feel that the renewal rates on SPDAs arenât very attractive. 
They would rather roll into a variable annuity, but donât feel 
they should have to incur a surrender charge period again.â 

Banks like it 
So far, banks seem to like the product. 
âWeâre still early in the process,â said Bonner. âBut 

weâve signed up about 15 to 20 banks so far. Thatâs a nice 
beginning for only a month into the process. They also feel 
that itâs agood alternative to bring to the table. And weâre not 
saying itâs your only choice. We do have still our Keyport 
Advisor variable annuity, which has conventional surrender 
charges.â 

But does Vista have a lower yield than the traditional 
Advisor product, to make up for the fact that it has no 
surrender charge? 

âNo,â Bonner answered. âWhat Vista has is first a higher 
minimum amount that you have to put into the contract, 
which is $25,000, compared to Keyport Advisor, which is 
$5,000. And then, the M&E [Management and Expense] 
components of both contracts are virtually identical, at 140 
basis points during the accumulation period. On Keyport 
Advisor, the M&Echarges drop to 125 basis points during an 
income period, if you convert it to an income, and annuitize 
it. But the M&E remains at 140 during an income period for 
the Vista product.â 

And in other respects, the products are pretty much 
identical? 

âTo the consumer,â Bonner clarified. âThere are differ- 
ent funds. There is a slightly different fund lineup. Weâve 
introduced AIM funds into the Vista product. Especially in 

the bank marketplace, AIM seems to have a very good 
following. But in both products we have, I think, a robust 
array of fund alternatives. Both have asset allocation models 
from Ibbotson Associates and Standard & Poorâs. But then, 
where they are different is that at the distributor level, with 
the Vista product, we do have a chargeback (to the distribu- 
tor) on compensation in the event that there is a surrender in 
the early years.â 

Neither product is designed for short-term ownership, 
however. 

Bonner thinks that creativity and the desire to be 
different will prevent variable annuities from 
becoming commodity products. 

âBasically, what weâve tried to do is to say that the real 
power of these contracts is in a long term relationship,â 
Bonner offered. âWeâve tried to build a lot of incentives into 
the product to keep the contract in force. But in the case of 
Keyport Advisor, if something changes and a customer 
wants to leave, okay. But then we get a little bit of money 
back from the customer for that liquidity feature. In the Vista 
product, weâre taking a little bit back from the distributor, 
and trying, again, to incent everybody to not cause disruption 
of the product, which is really essential.â 

What percentage of customers do they anticipate will 
surrender? 

âWe expect really a very small number to surrender 
during the early years,â Bonner asserted. âWe think it will be 
something in the 5 percent or less range. If everybody is 
incented to keep it in place, then someone will leave only in 
situations where thereâs really a need.â 

A flexible payout option 
Vista also features Keyportâs Preferred Income Plan 

(PIP), a payout option that provides tax-advantaged pay- 
ments either for a specific number of years or until age 100. 
It can be used as an immediate payout option, or activated at 
any time during the life of a Keyport Advisor Vista contract. 

As the population ages, more people will be retiring 
earlier. But social security and defined benefit corporate 
pension plans wonât be there to support them, as in years past. 
So more people will have to create their own pension plans. 

âWe know that annuities will have a unique role to play 
in that,â Bonner asserted, âand they are the only vehicle that 
allow you to provide yourself with an income that you canât 
outlive. But we also recognize that even though they have 
those features, very few people have historically used annu- 
ities for income. And the research that weâve done shows us 
that one of the major reasons for that is that because once you 
elect to receive income under the conventional annuity, you 
give up your liquidity rights. The insurance company will 

BANKS IN INSURANCE REPORT OCTOBER 1998 15 
0 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 



provide you with a lifetime income, but you no longer have 
access to your assets in the event that something changes, and 
you need them.â 

âThere was a real resistance to that in an environment 
where people had pretty good social security benefits, and 
pretty good corporate pension plans, and werenât living that 
long after they retired. So we feel that itâs going to be even 
more of a barrier when those factors are going to cause 
people to say, âHey, Iâve got to think about flexibility here, 
not just lifetime income.ââ 

Maintaining liquidity 
PIP allows people to have an income, but also to main- 

tain liquidity. 
âWhat we did with PIP,â said Bonner, âwhich I think is 

the breakthrough, is that we created an annuity that will 
provide income for anywhere from five to 50 years, and up 
to age 100. But it allows you complete liquidity at any time 
during the income period. So letâs say youâre 55 years old, 
and you retire and set up an income to age 100. But if you get 
to age 65, and something changes, you have complete access 
to the assets that are left in a Keyport Advisor contract with 
a phone call and by signing a forin.â 

But from an actuarial point of view, how did Keyport 
afford to do that? 

âThe main thing,â Bonner answered, âis that because itâs 
in a variable annuity, the actual investment risk is basically 
passed on to the customer. The value of whatâs in the account 
depends upon the stockmarket. Weâre malung our money on 
the payment of the M&E charges year after year. So that our 
real risk is that somebody would surrender or cash out in the 
very early years of an income period. 

âBut by and large, we think that people who are creating 
that sort of structure are doing it with an even deeper intent 
to have it endure over a long period of time. So that actuari- 
ally, it wonât be a major factor. Thatâs essentially how we can 
do it with a period certain with the variable annuity, and the 
long term relationships.â 

âBut there are a couple of other things are in PIP that we 
think make it attractive,â Bonner continued. âOne is that 
weâve added flexibility. Letâs say you set up a stream of 
income, and you designate it for a period of 35 years. But 
later, perhaps the stock marketâs going great guns, and 
youâre getting more money from it than you need. So we 
allow you to lengthen that period of income that youâve 
designated. So you could take the 35 to 40 or 45 or 50 years 
and reduce, obviously, the amount of monthly income - but 
provide income for a longer period.â 

So PIP lets the customer change the length of the payout 
contract, payout amounts and underlying investment portfo- 
lio. It also has an income leveling feature, that lets customers 
receive consistent payment amounts over a 12-month pe- 
riod. And PIP has tax advantages over traditional systematic 
withdraw a1 programs. 

âSo again, itâs more flexibility for people as they plan for 
this longer retirement period,â Bonner offered. âThe income 
levelization feature is also important. Typically, with a 
variable annuity. if you were in an income phase, the amount 
of the income would go up and down every month with the 
stock market results. And we find that people would rather 
have an annual planning kmd of a cycle. So if you elect this 
option, what you can do is have us set the amount of income 
for a 12-month period. Weâll hold it there for 12 months. 
Then, at the end of I2 months, weâll look at what the marketâs 
done, and set it for the next 12 months, and hold it steady for 
12 months. So it just delivers a little more certainty on an 
annual planning and budgeting cycle.â 

It makes the product look more like a conventional 
pension, in fact. 

âThatâs true,â said Bonner. 
And there are also some tax advantages over traditional 

systematic withdrawal programs. 
âItâs taxed as an annuity policy,â Bonner reminded us. 

âSo a portion of every payment is attributed to the deposit 
that you made in the contract, and that comes out tax free. 
And you only pay taxes on the amount of growth that is 
imputed to each payment.â 

A commodity product? 
Banks are selling more annuities than other kinds of 

insurance. So are variable annuities becoming a generic, 
commodity product? 

âI guess there are constant pressures that would push 
them in the direction of becoming commodity products,â 
Bonner admitted. âBut thereâs also a steady stream of inno- 
vation, and a desire to differentiate one product from another. 
So while there is some tendency in that direction, I think 
thereâs an awful lot of competition. And the competition is 
going to be working to come up with new and different ways 
to differentiate these products from each other. 

âSo I donât think so. I think competition will continue to 
intensify. And on the one hand, that pushes it a little bit 
towards a commodity. But the creativity and desire to be 
different will keep it from becoming a commodity.â 

Weâve been riding the crest of the business cycle wave 
for some time. Some people believe that a bear market is 
coming soon. So would Keyport change its approach to- 
wards marketing the product in a declining stock market? 

âI donât think we would significantly shift our approach 
to marketing the product,â Bonner maintained. ââItâs long 
term. And over the long term, the market has tended to out 
perform inflation. and the other things that people look to 
worry about.â 

âIf you have a very short term horizon,â he admitted, 
âthen you should look at these products differently. But if 
not, then you should really see a down cycle as an opportu- 
nity to get in at lower cost than if it were at the peak, or farther 
up the cycle.â

longer, they just donât want to accept that kind of barrier 
between them and liquidity.â 

More and more customers don ât want topay surrender 
fees. 

For many annuities, the customer must pay a surrender 
charge if he wants to convert the annuity to cash before year 
seven. More and more consumers apparently donât like that. 

âThey may be people who just value liquidity,â Bonner 
suggested. âIt may just open up a whole segment of the 
market - people who have not purchased annuities be- 
cause they just donât like that liquidity feature. They may 
be people who have bought annuities before, who have 
already lived through a surrender charge period, and are 
looking for a more up-to-date place to put their money. Then

they donât feel that they should have to incur another 
surrender charge period as part of the product. So we felt that 
it made sense to take a hard look at it.â 

What do surrender charges typically average on a vari- 
able annuity these days? 

âI think the typical thing that you see,â Bonner re- 
sponded, âis 7 percent in the first year, and then declining 1 
percent each additional year. So it is 6 percent in the second 
year, 5 percent in the third, and so on.â 

That might deter people who are new to annuities. 
âThere is obviously a lot of volatility out there,â Bonner 

admitted. âAnd while hopefully the products are sold as long 
term products, a lot of people are just nervous about putting 
barriers between them and their liquidity.â 

But how important are the no-surrender charge and no 
maintenance fee charge features for bank customers? 

âWe think,â Bonner responded, âthat they are poten- 
tially important, again to certain segments of the bank 
population - the segments who are resistant to surrender 
charges, either because they just donât like them or because 
theyâve already paid a surrender charge. It might have been 
in an SPDA [Single Premium Deferred Annuity] or other 
annuity. Theyâve lived through the surrender period and now 
feel that the renewal rates on SPDAs arenât very attractive. 
They would rather roll into a variable annuity, but donât feel 
they should have to incur a surrender charge period again.â 

Banks like it 
So far, banks seem to like the product. 
âWeâre still early in the process,â said Bonner. âBut 

weâve signed up about 15 to 20 banks so far. Thatâs a nice 
beginning for only a month into the process. They also feel 
that itâs agood alternative to bring to the table. And weâre not 
saying itâs your only choice. We do have still our Keyport 
Advisor variable annuity, which has conventional surrender 
charges.â 

But does Vista have a lower yield than the traditional 
Advisor product, to make up for the fact that it has no 
surrender charge? 

âNo,â Bonner answered. âWhat Vista has is first a higher 
minimum amount that you have to put into the contract, 
which is $25,000, compared to Keyport Advisor, which is 
$5,000. And then, the M&E [Management and Expense] 
components of both contracts are virtually identical, at 140 
basis points during the accumulation period. On Keyport 
Advisor, the M&Echarges drop to 125 basis points during an 
income period, if you convert it to an income, and annuitize 
it. But the M&E remains at 140 during an income period for 
the Vista product.â 

And in other respects, the products are pretty much 
identical? 

âTo the consumer,â Bonner clarified. âThere are differ- 
ent funds. There is a slightly different fund lineup. Weâve 
introduced AIM funds into the Vista product. Especially in 

the bank marketplace, AIM seems to have a very good 
following. But in both products we have, I think, a robust 
array of fund alternatives. Both have asset allocation models 
from Ibbotson Associates and Standard & Poorâs. But then, 
where they are different is that at the distributor level, with 
the Vista product, we do have a chargeback (to the distribu- 
tor) on compensation in the event that there is a surrender in 
the early years.â 

Neither product is designed for short-term ownership, 
however. 

Bonner thinks that creativity and the desire to be 
different will prevent variable annuities from 
becoming commodity products. 

âBasically, what weâve tried to do is to say that the real 
power of these contracts is in a long term relationship,â 
Bonner offered. âWeâve tried to build a lot of incentives into 
the product to keep the contract in force. But in the case of 
Keyport Advisor, if something changes and a customer 
wants to leave, okay. But then we get a little bit of money 
back from the customer for that liquidity feature. In the Vista 
product, weâre taking a little bit back from the distributor, 
and trying, again, to incent everybody to not cause disruption 
of the product, which is really essential.â 

What percentage of customers do they anticipate will 
surrender? 

âWe expect really a very small number to surrender 
during the early years,â Bonner asserted. âWe think it will be 
something in the 5 percent or less range. If everybody is 
incented to keep it in place, then someone will leave only in 
situations where thereâs really a need.â 

A flexible payout option 
Vista also features Keyportâs Preferred Income Plan 

(PIP), a payout option that provides tax-advantaged pay- 
ments either for a specific number of years or until age 100. 
It can be used as an immediate payout option, or activated at 
any time during the life of a Keyport Advisor Vista contract. 

As the population ages, more people will be retiring 
earlier. But social security and defined benefit corporate 
pension plans wonât be there to support them, as in years past. 
So more people will have to create their own pension plans. 

âWe know that annuities will have a unique role to play 
in that,â Bonner asserted, âand they are the only vehicle that 
allow you to provide yourself with an income that you canât 
outlive. But we also recognize that even though they have 
those features, very few people have historically used annu- 
ities for income. And the research that weâve done shows us 
that one of the major reasons for that is that because once you 
elect to receive income under the conventional annuity, you 
give up your liquidity rights. The insurance company will

0 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 



provide you with a lifetime income, but you no longer have 
access to your assets in the event that something changes, and 
you need them.â 

âThere was a real resistance to that in an environment 
where people had pretty good social security benefits, and 
pretty good corporate pension plans, and werenât living that 
long after they retired. So we feel that itâs going to be even 
more of a barrier when those factors are going to cause 
people to say, âHey, Iâve got to think about flexibility here, 
not just lifetime income.ââ 

Maintaining liquidity 
PIP allows people to have an income, but also to main- 

tain liquidity. 
âWhat we did with PIP,â said Bonner, âwhich I think is 

the breakthrough, is that we created an annuity that will 
provide income for anywhere from five to 50 years, and up 
to age 100. But it allows you complete liquidity at any time 
during the income period. So letâs say youâre 55 years old, 
and you retire and set up an income to age 100. But if you get 
to age 65, and something changes, you have complete access 
to the assets that are left in a Keyport Advisor contract with 
a phone call and by signing a forin.â 

But from an actuarial point of view, how did Keyport 
afford to do that? 

âThe main thing,â Bonner answered, âis that because itâs 
in a variable annuity, the actual investment risk is basically 
passed on to the customer. The value of whatâs in the account 
depends upon the stockmarket. Weâre malung our money on 
the payment of the M&E charges year after year. So that our 
real risk is that somebody would surrender or cash out in the 
very early years of an income period. 

âBut by and large, we think that people who are creating 
that sort of structure are doing it with an even deeper intent 
to have it endure over a long period of time. So that actuari- 
ally, it wonât be a major factor. Thatâs essentially how we can 
do it with a period certain with the variable annuity, and the 
long term relationships.â 

âBut there are a couple of other things are in PIP that we 
think make it attractive,â Bonner continued. âOne is that 
weâve added flexibility. Letâs say you set up a stream of 
income, and you designate it for a period of 35 years. But 
later, perhaps the stock marketâs going great guns, and 
youâre getting more money from it than you need. So we 
allow you to lengthen that period of income that youâve 
designated. So you could take the 35 to 40 or 45 or 50 years 
and reduce, obviously, the amount of monthly income - but 
provide income for a longer period.â 

So PIP lets the customer change the length of the payout 
contract, payout amounts and underlying investment portfo- 
lio. It also has an income leveling feature, that lets customers 
receive consistent payment amounts over a 12-month pe- 
riod. And PIP has tax advantages over traditional systematic 
withdraw a1 programs. 

âSo again, itâs more flexibility for people as they plan for 
this longer retirement period,â Bonner offered. âThe income 
levelization feature is also important. Typically, with a 
variable annuity. if you were in an income phase, the amount 
of the income would go up and down every month with the 
stock market results. And we find that people would rather 
have an annual planning kmd of a cycle. So if you elect this 
option, what you can do is have us set the amount of income 
for a 12-month period. Weâll hold it there for 12 months. 
Then, at the end of I2 months, weâll look at what the marketâs 
done, and set it for the next 12 months, and hold it steady for 
12 months. So it just delivers a little more certainty on an 
annual planning and budgeting cycle.â 

It makes the product look more like a conventional 
pension, in fact. 

âThatâs true,â said Bonner. 
And there are also some tax advantages over traditional 

systematic withdrawal programs. 
âItâs taxed as an annuity policy,â Bonner reminded us. 

âSo a portion of every payment is attributed to the deposit 
that you made in the contract, and that comes out tax free. 
And you only pay taxes on the amount of growth that is 
imputed to each payment.â 

A commodity product? 
Banks are selling more annuities than other kinds of 

insurance. So are variable annuities becoming a generic, 
commodity product? 

âI guess there are constant pressures that would push 
them in the direction of becoming commodity products,â 
Bonner admitted. âBut thereâs also a steady stream of inno- 
vation, and a desire to differentiate one product from another. 
So while there is some tendency in that direction, I think 
thereâs an awful lot of competition. And the competition is 
going to be working to come up with new and different ways 
to differentiate these products from each other. 

âSo I donât think so. I think competition will continue to 
intensify. And on the one hand, that pushes it a little bit 
towards a commodity. But the creativity and desire to be 
different will keep it from becoming a commodity.â 

Weâve been riding the crest of the business cycle wave 
for some time. Some people believe that a bear market is 
coming soon. So would Keyport change its approach to- 
wards marketing the product in a declining stock market? 

âI donât think we would significantly shift our approach 
to marketing the product,â Bonner maintained. ââItâs long 
term. And over the long term, the market has tended to out 
perform inflation. and the other things that people look to 
worry about.â 

âIf you have a very short term horizon,â he admitted, 
âthen you should look at these products differently. But if 
not, then you should really see a down cycle as an opportu- 
nity to get in at lower cost than if it were at the peak, or farther 
up the cycle.â
