	U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) became law in March 2010 and is effective as of July 1, 2014. The law is enforced by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
Under the provisions of FATCA, insurers may need to obtain withholding certificates (IRS Forms W-8 or W-9) from their business partners. Typically, a W-8 is provided by non-U.S. entities and a W-9 is provided by U.S. entities. Business partners conducting business with The Hartford may request copies of these completed forms from taxcompliance2@thehartford.com.
 
Additionally, copies of blank IRS forms (W-8 and W-9) and further information can be found on the IRS website.

5 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor

















There is never a bad time to review your financial plan with your financial advisor. You should make it a point to do so at least once a year. To help ensure you get the most out of the discussion, get prepared and plan to participate.
 

	Prepare
Gather your financial documents, such as your income tax return and your latest statements for any mutual funds, annuities, retirement plans, life insurance policies, and savings accounts.
 

	Participate
Balance your advisor's questions with some questions of your own, such as:


What tax-saving strategies do I need to know about?
		Discuss your mix of tax-free or tax-deferred assets versus taxable costs.
		 

Am I taking advantage of the right financial products?
		Your financial advisor can review the advantages and limitations of new investment products and features, and help determine if they could fit into your portfolio.
		 

How has the risk level of my portfolio changed in light of the economic events of the past year?
		Your financial advisor should be ready, willing, and able to address your concerns about investments. Make sure the risk level of your portfolio matches your risk tolerance, especially if either one has changed.
		 

What changes should I make, based on changes to my family situation or finances?
		Discuss personally significant events you experienced in the past year, as well as any changes in your viewpoint on saving taxes, budgeting, or other financial issues.
		 

Is anything missing from my financial strategy?
		While reviewing your financial documents, your financial advisor can help identify and fill any gaps in your portfolio. For example, your income tax return (Form 1040) may uncover more tax-efficient ways to save in the future.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

(1) These expenses are annualized. The Fund began operations on June 17, 1999.

(2) The Fund's Class 2 distribution plan or "Rule 12b-1 Plan" is described in
the Fund's prospectus. While the maximum amount payable under the Fund's
Class 2 Rule 12b-1 Plan is 0.35% per year of the Fund's average daily net
assets, the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance
Products Trust has set the current rate at 0.25% per year through at least
April 30, 2001.

(3) The fund administration fee is paid indirectly through the management fee.

(4) On 2/8/00, a merger and reorganization was approved that combined the
Franklin Small Cap Fund with a similar fund of the Templeton Variable
Products Series Fund, effective 5/1/00. On 2/8/00, fund shareholders
approved new management fees, which apply to the combined fund effective
5/1/00. The table shows restated total expenses based on the new fees and
assets of the fund as of 12/31/99, and not the assets of the combined fund.
However, if the table reflected both the new fees and the combined assets,
the fund's expenses after 5/1/00 would be estimated as: Management Fees
0.55%, Distribution and Service Fees 0.25%, Other Expenses 0.27%, and Total
Fund Operating Expenses 1.07%.





(5) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 0.75% of average net assets for
the current fiscal year. After December 31, 2001, the manager and
administrator may end this arrangement at any time. Without this reduction
Total Fund Operating Expenses were:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(6) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 1.30% of average net assets,
including Class 2's 12b-1 plan fee, for the current fiscal year. After
December 31, 2001, the manager and administrator may end this arrangement at
any time.


(7) Each Series has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the series'
custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the series with
its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each series may enter into
other such arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would
also have the effect of reducing the series' expenses. After these
reductions, the Total Fund Operating Expenses would be:

(8) MFS has contractually agreed, subject to reimbursement, to bear expenses for
these series such that each such series' "Other Expenses" (after taking into
account the expense offset arrangement described above), do not exceed 0.15%
of the average daily net assets of the series during the current fiscal
year. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least
May 1, 2001, unless changed with the consent of the board of trustees which
oversees the series. Without this waiver, "Total Fund Operating Expenses"

Item 26. Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or
Registrant



Filed herewith as Exhibit 16.



Item 27. Number of Contract Owners




As of July 31, 2000, there were 10,733 Contract Owners.




Item 28. Indemnification



Sections 33-770 to 33-778, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes ("CGS") provide that a corporation may provide indemnification
of or advance expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent.
Reference is hereby made to Section 33-771(e) of CGS regarding
indemnification of directors and Section 33-776(d) of CGS regarding
indemnification of officers, employees and agents of Connecticut
corporations. These statutes provide, in general, that Connecticut
corporations incorporated prior to January 1, 1997 shall, except to the
extent that their certificate of incorporation expressly provides
otherwise, indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents
against "liability" (defined as the obligation to pay a judgment,
settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with
respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses incurred
with respect to a proceeding) when (1) a determination is made pursuant
to Section 33-775 that the party seeking indemnification has met the
standard of conduct set forth in Section 33-771 or (2) a court has
determined that indemnification is appropriate pursuant to Section
33-774. Under Section 33-775, the determination of and the
authorization for indemnification are made (a) by the disinterested
directors, as defined in Section 33-770(3); (b) by special counsel; (c)
by the shareholders; or (d) in the case of indemnification of an
officer, agent or employee of the corporation, by the general counsel
of the corporation or such other officer(s) as the board of directors
may specify. Also, Section 33-772 provides that a corporation shall
indemnify an individual who was wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection
with a proceeding to which he was a party because he was a director of
the corporation. In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation or with respect to conduct for which the director, officer,
agent or employee was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a
financial benefit to which he was not entitled, indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding against the corporation to which the individual was named a
party.


Under the Depositor's bylaws, the Depositor must indemnify both
directors and officers of the Depositor for (1) any claims and
liabilities to which they become subject by reason of being or having
been directors or officers of the Depositor and (2) legal and other
expenses incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to
the extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.





Section 33-777 of CGS specifically authorizes a corporation to procure
indemnification insurance on behalf of an individual who was a
director, officer, employer or agent of the corporation. Consistent
with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor and
Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and officers liability insurance policy issued to The
Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

be kept by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
rules thereunder, are maintained by Hartford at 200 Hopmeadow

Item 31. Management Services

FUND PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT



THIS AGREEMENT, made as of this ___ day of ____________, 2000 by and
among Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford"); a Connecticut corporation,
on its behalf and on behalf of each separate account set forth on SCHEDULE A
attached as it may be amended from time to time (the "Separate Accounts");
___________________ (the "Fund"); ___________________ (the "Distributor"); and
___________________ (the "Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Fund engages in business as an open-end management
investment company and is available to act as the investment vehicle for
separate accounts established by insurance companies for life insurance policies
and annuity contracts; and


WHEREAS, the Distributor is registered as a broker/dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), is a member in
good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") and serves as principal underwriter of the shares of the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable state securities
laws and serves as the investment adviser to the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Fund intends to make available shares of its series set
forth on SCHEDULE B, as it may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement
of the parties (the "Series"), to the Separate Accounts of Hartford; and


WHEREAS, Hartford is an insurance company which has registered or will
register the variable annuities and/or variable life insurance policies listed
in Schedule A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), unless exempt from such
registration, to be issued by Hartford for distribution (the "Contracts"); and


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, Hartford,
the Fund, the Distributor and the Adviser agree as follows:



ARTICLE I. FUND SHARES



1.1     The Fund and the Distributor agree to make shares of the Series
available for purchase on each Business Day by the Separate Accounts. The Fund
will execute orders placed for each Separate Account on a daily basis at the
net asset value of each Series next computed after receipt by the Fund or its
designee of such order.


3





A.     For purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the designee
of the Fund and Distributor for receipt of orders from each Separate Account
and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that the Fund
receives notice of orders by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the next following
Business Day.


B.     For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the
Fund calculates the net asset value of each Series pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as set forth in the Series'
prospectus.


1.2    The Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"), acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, may refuse to permit the
Fund to sell shares of any Series to any person, or suspend or terminate the
offering of shares of any Series if such action is required by law or by
regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the sale of shares.


1.3    The Fund and the Distributor agree that shares of the Fund or any of its
Series will be sold only to insurance companies for use in conjunction with
variable life insurance policies or variable annuities. No shares of the Fund
or any of its Series will be sold to the general public.


1.4    The Fund and the Distributor agree to redeem for cash, at Hartford's
request, any full or fractional shares of the Series held by the Separate
Accounts, on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt
by the Fund or its designee of the request for redemption.


A.     For the purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the
designee of the Fund for receipt of redemption requests from each Separate
Account and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that
the Distributor receives notice of the redemption request by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern
time) on the next following Business Day.


1.5    Hartford agrees that purchases and redemptions of Series shares offered
by the then current prospectus of the Series shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of the prospectus.


A.     Hartford will place separate orders to purchase or redeem
shares of each Series. Each order shall describe the net amount of shares and
dollar amount of each Series to be purchase or redeemed.


B.     In the event of net purchases, Hartford will pay for shares
before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next Business Day after receipt of an
order to purchase shares.


C.     In the event of net redemptions, the Fund shall pay the
redemption proceeds in federal funds transmitted by wire before 3:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the next Business Day after an order to redeem Fund shares is
made.


4





1.6    Issuance and transfer of the Series' shares will be by book entry only.
Share certificates will not be issued to Hartford or any Separate Account.
Shares purchased will be recorded in an appropriate title for each Separate
Account or the appropriate sub-account of each Separate Account. The Fund shall
furnish to Hartford the CUSIP number assigned to each Series identified in
Schedule B attached as may be amended from time to time.


1.7    The Distributor shall notify Hartford in advance of any dividends or
capital gain distributions payable on the Series' shares, but by no later than
same day notice by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (by wire or telephone, followed by
written confirmation). Hartford elects to reinvest all such dividends and
capital gain distributions in additional shares of that Series. The Fund shall
notify Hartford of the number of shares issued as payment of dividends and
distributions. Hartford reserves the right to revoke this election and to
receive all such dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.


1.8    The Distributor shall make the net asset value per share of each Series
available to Hartford on a daily basis as soon as reasonably practical after
the net asset value per share is calculated. The Fund shall use its best
efforts to make such net asset value per share available by 6:00 p.m. Eastern
time.


A.     If the Distributor provides materially incorrect share net
asset value information through no fault of Hartford, the Separate Accounts
shall be entitled to an adjustment with respect to the Series shares purchased
or redeemed to reflect the correct net asset value per share.


B.     The determination of the materiality of any net asset value
pricing error and its correction shall be based on the SEC's recommended
guidelines regarding these errors. Any material error in the calculation or
reporting of net asset value per share, dividend or capital gain information
shall be reported promptly to Hartford upon discovery. The Fund and/or its
agents shall indemnify and hold harmless Hartford against any amount Hartford
is legally required to pay qualified plans ("Plans") or annuity or life
insurance contract owners that have selected a Series as an investment option
("Contract owners"), and which amount is due to the Fund's or its agents'
material miscalculation and/or incorrect reporting of the daily net asset
value, dividend rate or capital gains distribution rate. Hartford shall submit
an invoice to the Fund or its agents for such losses incurred as a result of
the above which shall be payable within sixty (60) days of receipt. Should a
material miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to Hartford,
Hartford shall immediately reimburse the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents for any material losses incurred by the Fund, the applicable Series or
its agents as a result of the incorrect calculation. Should a material
miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to the Plans or
Contract owners, Hartford will consult with the Fund or its designee as to what
reasonable efforts shall be made to recover the money and repay the Fund, the
applicable Series or its agents. Hartford shall then make such reasonable
effort, at the expense of the Fund or its


5





agents, to recover the money and repay the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents; but Hartford shall not be obligated to take legal action against the
Plans or Contract owners.


With respect to the material errors or omissions described above, this section
shall control over other indemnification provisions in this Agreement.

steps necessary to adequately diversify the Series so as to achieve compliance
within the grace period afforded by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.817-5.



ARTICLE VI. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS



6.1    The Board of Directors of the Fund will monitor the Series for the
existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the
Contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the Series. The Board of
Directors of the Fund shall promptly inform Hartford if it determines that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists and the implications thereof.


9





6.2    Hartford will report any potential or existing material irreconcilable
conflict of which it is aware to the Board of Directors of the Fund. This
includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by Hartford to inform the Board
of Directors of the Fund whenever Contract owner voting instructions are
disregarded.


6.3    If it is determined by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
or a majority of its independent Directors, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists due to issues relating to the Contracts, Hartford will, at its
expense and to the extent reasonably practicable, take whatever steps it can
which are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including, without limitation, withdrawal of the affected Separate
Account's investment in the Series. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a
result of such withdrawal.


6.4    Hartford, at the request of the Adviser will, at least annually, submit
to the Board of Directors of the Fund such reports, materials or data as the
Board may reasonably request so that the Board may fully carry out the
obligations imposed upon them. All reports received by the Board of potential
or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining the
existence of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately
remedies a conflict, shall be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or
other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made
available to the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.



ARTICLE VII. INDEMNIFICATION



7.1    Indemnification by Hartford

meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"
and individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.1)
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts
paid in settlement with the written consent of Hartford, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including the reasonable costs of
investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)
(collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject
under any statute or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of Series shares or the Contracts
and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in a disclosure
document for the Contracts or in the Contracts themselves or in sales
literature generated or approved by Hartford applicable to the Contracts or
Separate Accounts (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing)
(collectively, "Company Documents" for the purposes of this Article VII), or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the


10





alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, provided that this
indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified Party if such statement or
omission or such alleged statement or omission was made in reliance upon and
was accurately derived from written information furnished to Hartford by or on
behalf of the Fund for use in Company Documents or otherwise for use in
connection with the sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Fund Documents as defined in Section 7.2 (A)(1)) or
wrongful conduct of Hartford or persons under its control, with respect to the
sale or acquisition of the Contracts or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Fund Documents as
defined in Section 7.2(A)(1) or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and accurately derived from written information furnished to the
Fund by or on behalf of Hartford; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by Hartford to
provide the services or furnish the materials required under the terms of this
Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by Hartford in this Agreement or arise out
of or result from any other material breach of this Agreement by Hartford; as
limited by and in accordance with, Sections 7.1(B) and 7.1(C) hereof.


B.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any Losses which are due to an Indemnified Party's
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such
Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless
disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to the Fund or
Distributor, whichever is applicable.


C.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified Party unless
such Indemnified Party shall have notified Hartford in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify Hartford of any
such claim shall not relieve Hartford from any liability which it may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, Hartford shall be entitled to participate, at
its own expense, in the


11





defense of such action. Hartford also shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action. After
notice from Hartford to such party of Hartford's election to assume the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any
additional counsel retained by it, and Hartford will not be liable to such
party under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties will promptly notify Hartford of the
commencement of any litigation or proceedings against them or any of their
officers or directors in connection with the issuance or sale of the Series
shares or the Contracts or the operation of the Fund.


7.2    Indemnification by the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund


A.     The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund agree to indemnify and
hold harmless Hartford and each of its directors, officers, employees and

Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties" and
individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.2) against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement with the written consent of the Distributor, the Adviser, and the
Fund, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including
the reasonable costs of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in
connection therewith) (collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified
Parties may become subject under any statute or regulation, or at common law or
otherwise, insofar as such Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of the
Series' shares or the Contracts and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration
statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Fund applicable to the Series
(or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing) (collectively, "Fund
Documents" for purposes of Article this VII) or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, provided that this indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified
Party if such statement or omission of such alleged statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and was accurately derived from written information
furnished to the Fund, the Adviser, or the Distributor by or on behalf of
Hartford for use in Fund Documents or otherwise for use in connection with the
sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Company


12





Documents) or wrongful conduct of the Fund, Adviser or Distributor or persons
under their control, with respect to the sale or distribution of the Contracts
or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Company Documents, or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and accurately derived
from written information furnished to Hartford by or on behalf of the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund to provide the services or furnish the
materials required under the terms of this Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the
Fund in this Agreement or arise out of or result from any other material breach
of this Agreement by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; as limited by,
and in accordance with, Sections 7.2(B) and 7.2(C) hereof.


B.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any Losses which are due
to an Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of such Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such
Indemnified Party's reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this
Agreement or to Hartford or the Separate Account, whichever is applicable.


C.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any claim made against an
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund, as applicable, in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund of any such claim shall not relieve the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund from any liability which they may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund
shall be entitled to participate, at their own expense, in the defense thereof.
The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund also shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.
After notice from the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund to such party of
their election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear
the expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the Distributor, the
Adviser, and the Fund will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred


13





by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Distributor,
the Adviser, and the Fund of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings
against them or any of their officers or directors in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Contracts or the operation of a Separate Account.


7.3    Any party seeking indemnification (the "Potential Indemnitee") will
promptly notify any party from whom they intend to seek indemnification (each a
"Potential Indemnitor") of all demands made and/or actions commenced against
the Potential Indemnitee which may require a Potential Indemnitor to provide
such indemnification. At its option and expense, a Potential Indemnitor may
retain counsel and control any litigation for which it may be responsible to
indemnify a Potential Indemnitee under this Agreement.


7.4    With respect to any claim, the parties each shall give the others
reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records, and
employees and those books, records, and employees within its control pertaining
to such claim, and shall otherwise cooperate with one and other in the defense
of any claim. Regardless of which party defends a particular claim, the
defending party shall give the other parties written notice of any significant
development in the case as soon as practicable, and such other parties, at all
times, shall have the right to intervene in the defense of the case.


7.5    If a party is defending a claim and indemnifying another party hereto,
and: (i) a settlement proposal is made by the claimant, or (ii) the defending
party desires to present a settlement proposal to the claimant, then the
defending party promptly shall notify the Indemnified Party of such settlement
proposal together with its counsel's recommendation. If the defending party
desires to enter into the settlement and the Indemnified Party fails to consent
within five (5) business days (unless such period is extended, in writing, by
mutual agreement of the parties hereto), then the Indemnified Party, from the
time it fails to consent forward, shall defend the claim and shall indemnify
the defending party for all costs associated with the claim which are in excess
of the proposed settlement amount.


Regardless of which party is defending the claim: (i) if a settlement requires
an admission of liability by the non-defending party or would require the
non-defending party to either take action (other than purely ministerial
action) or refrain from taking action (due to an injunction or otherwise) (a
"Specific Performance Settlement"), the defending party may agree to such
settlement only after obtaining the express, written consent of the
non-defending party. If a non-defending party fails to consent to a Specific
Performance Settlement, the consequences described in the last sentence of the
first paragraph of this Section 7.5 shall NOT apply.


14





7.6    The parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute
concerning this indemnification obligation. Should those efforts fail to
resolve the dispute, the ultimate resolution shall be determined in a DE NOVO
proceeding, separate and apart from the underlying matter complained of, before
a court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may initiate such proceedings
with a court of competent jurisdiction at any time following the termination of
the efforts by such parties to resolve the dispute (termination of such efforts
shall be deemed to have occurred thirty (30) days from the commencement of the
same unless such time period is extended by the written agreement of the
parties). The prevailing party in such a proceeding shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.



ARTICLE VIII. APPLICABLE LAW



8.1    This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted
under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut.


8.2    This Agreement, its terms and definitions, shall be subject to the

9.1    This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the first
to occur of:


A.     Termination by any party for any reason upon six-months advance
written notice delivered to the other parties; or


B.     Termination by Hartford by written notice to the Fund, the
Adviser or the Distributor with respect to any Series in the event any of the
Series' shares are not registered, issued or sold in accordance with applicable
state and/or federal law, or such law precludes the use of such shares as the
underlying investment medium of the Contracts issued or to be issued by
Hartford; or,


C.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund with
respect to any Series in the event that such Series ceases to qualify as a
Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code or under any
successor or similar provision; or


D.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund and the
Distributor with respect to any Series in the event that such Fund fails to
meet the diversification requirements specified in Section 5.1 of this
Agreement.


E.     Termination upon mutual written agreement of the parties to
this Agreement.


15





9.2    Effect of Termination.


A.     Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Fund
shall, at the option of Hartford, continue to make available additional shares
of the Series pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for all
Contracts in effect on the effective date of termination of this Agreement (the
"Existing Contracts") unless such further sale of Series shares is proscribed
by law, regulation or applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without
limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts will be permitted to direct
allocation and reallocation of investments in the Fund, redeem investments in
the Series and invest in the Series through additional purchase payments.


B.     Hartford agrees not to redeem Series shares attributable to the
Contracts except (i) as necessary to implement Contract owner initiated or
approved transactions, or (ii) as required by state and/or federal laws or
regulations or judicial or other legal precedent of general application or

(iii) as permitted by an order of the SEC. Upon request, Hartford will promptly
furnish to the Fund the opinion of counsel for Hartford to the effect that any
redemption pursuant to clause (ii) above is a legally required redemption.


C.     In addition to the foregoing, Article VII Indemnification shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

RE:    HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT SEVEN
FILE NO. 333-76423



Dear Sir/Madam:


I have acted as General Counsel to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company
(the "Company"), a Connecticut insurance company, and Separate Account Seven
(the "Account") in Connecticut with the registration of an indefinite amount of
securities in the form of variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
I have examined such documents (including the Form N-4 registration statement)
and reviewed such questions of law as I considered necessary and appropriate,
and on the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:


1.     The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing as a
stock life insurance company under the laws of the State of Connecticut
and is duly authorized by the Insurance Department of the State of
Connecticut to issue the Contracts.


2.     The Account is a duly authorized and existing separate account
established pursuant to the provisions of Section 38a-433 of the
Connecticut Statutes.


3.     To the extent so provided under the Contracts, that portion of the assets
of the Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising
out of any other business that the Company may conduct.


4.     The Contracts, when issued as contemplated by the Form N-4 Registration
Statement, will constitute legal, validly issued and binding obligations
of the Company.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form N-4
registration statement for the Contracts and the Account.


Sincerely yours,






/s/ Lynda Godkin

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
