ATLANTA & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arbor Pharmaceuticals (“Arbor”), a specialty pharmaceutical company, 
      today announced that KKR, a leading global investment firm, is acquiring 
      a significant minority stake in the company. Financial terms of the 
      transaction were not disclosed.
    


      Acquired by its current investor group in 2010, Arbor markets branded 
      prescription products for the cardiovascular, hospital, and pediatric 
      markets as well as generic products through its Wilshire division. The 
      company has completed over twenty acquisition, licensing, or product 
      development transactions over the past four years and has multiple 
      products filed with the FDA as well as several branded and generic 
      products in late-stage development.
    

      “Arbor is led by an accomplished management team with a track record of 
      building and scaling specialty pharmaceutical platforms. We believe that 
      Arbor, with its diversified product portfolio, late-stage development 
      pipeline, and proven business development acumen, is well positioned for 
      continued growth,” said Ali Satvat, Director on KKR’s Health Care 
      investing team.
    

      “Arbor remains committed to creating value for patients by identifying, 
      developing, and bringing to market improved medicines with a focus on 
      quality. Arbor and our new investment partner KKR maintain a shared 
      vision for continuing to provide quality products that offer significant 
      clinical benefits to patients,” commented Ed Schutter, President and CEO 
      of Arbor.
    

      “We are pleased to be adding KKR, with its extensive industry 
      experience, to our shareholder base. We selected KKR based on a number 
      of factors, including compatibility with Arbor and a shared vision for 
      achieving future growth. This is an important next step as we continue 
      building a fully integrated pharmaceutical company focused on products 
      that improve patients’ lives,” added Jason Wild, Chairman of the Board 
      of Arbor and President of JW Asset Management LLC.
    

      KKR has a long history of investing in and growing leading health care 
      companies, including Alliance Boots, Biomet, Gland Pharma, HCA, Jazz 
      Pharmaceuticals, and PRA Health Sciences. KKR is funding the Arbor 
      investment primarily from its North America XI private equity fund. The 
      transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other 
      customary closing conditions, is expected to close early in the first 
      quarter of 2015.
    

      Lazard Middle Market served as financial advisor and King & Spalding LLP

 MANAGEMENT

3.1     
Class A
Members .
(a) Class A Members who hold a majority of the Class A Shares
outstanding shall represent a “ Majority in Interest of
Class A Members ”; provided that the Members
hereby agree that at any time there shall be one or more Designated
Members, the then-serving Designated Members shall be deemed to
represent at least a Majority in Interest of Class A Members for
all purposes under this Agreement and all other Class A Members
shall be deemed to represent less than a Majority in Interest of
Class A Members for all purposes of this Agreement.

(b)     
Henry R. Kravis and
George R. Roberts each shall be an original “ Designated
Member .” The Designated Members may designate any one or
more other Members as successor or additional Designated Members,
which successor or additional Designated Members shall exercise all
rights and duties of the Designated Members hereunder. A Designated
Member shall cease to be a Designated Member only if he (A)
Withdraws or (B) consents in his sole discretion to resign as a
Designated Member, but does not Withdraw. Except as specified in
the preceding sentence, a Designated Member may not be removed
without his consent.

(c)     
Any action by the
Designated Members pursuant to this Agreement shall require the
unanimous approval of all the then-serving Designated Members. Upon
any Designated Member ceasing to be a Designated Member pursuant to
Section 3.1(b), the remaining Designated Members shall exercise all
rights and duties of the Designated Members hereunder. At any time
when there shall not be any Designated Members, all of the powers
vested in the Designated Members pursuant to this Agreement and the
LLC Act shall be exercised by a Majority in Interest of Class A
Members, including all matters relating to the governance of the
Company and the establishment of a new management
structure.

(d)     
All decisions and
determinations (howsoever described herein) to be made by the
Board, any committee of the Board, any individual Director or
Officer, the Designated Members or Class A Members pursuant to this
Agreement shall be made in their discretion. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision
of law or equity, whenever in this Agreement the Board, any
committee of the Board, any individual Director or Officer, the
Designated Members or Class A Members are permitted or required to
make a decision in their “discretion” or under a grant
of similar authority or latitude, the Board or such committee of
the Board, individual Director or Officer, Designated Members or
Class A Members shall be entitled to consider only such interests
and factors as they desire, including their own interests, and
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have no
duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or
factors affecting the Company or the Members. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the Class A Members have no authority
to bind the Company.

3.2     
Class B
Members .
Class B Members shall have no right to participate in the
management of the Company or to receive any information concerning
the affairs of the Company and shall not have any other rights of a
Member under this Agreement other than to cause Foreign Voting
Interests held by any Affiliate of the Company or the Issuer to be
voted in accordance with the directions provided by such Class B
Members pursuant to Section 3.3(m). The Company will ensure that
there are not less than 12 Class B Members at all times. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Class B Members have no
authority to bind the Company.

3.3     
Board of
Directors .

(a)     
Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the business and affairs of
the Company shall be managed by or under the direction of a
committee of the Company (the “ Board ”)
consisting of one or more natural persons designated as directors
of the Company as provided below (“ Directors
”). A Director shall be a “manager” within the
meaning of the LLC Act. Except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Agreement, no Member, by virtue of its status as such,
shall have any management power over the business and affairs of
the Company or actual or, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
apparent, authority to enter into, execute or deliver contracts on
behalf of, or to otherwise bind, the Company. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, the authority and
functions of the Board shall be identical to the authority and
functions of the board of directors of a corporation organized
under the Delaware General Corporation Law. In addition to the
powers that now or hereafter can be granted to managers under the
LLC Act and to all other powers granted under any other provision
of this Agreement, but subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the Board shall have full power and authority to do all things and
on such terms as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to
conduct the business of the Company and to exercise all powers and
effectuate the purposes set forth in this Agreement;
provided , however, the Board shall not be responsible for
the day-to-day business, operations and affairs of the Subsidiaries
and Advised Entities, including transactions entered into by a
Subsidiary or an Advised Entity in the ordinary course.

(b)     
(i) Subject to Section
3.3(b)(ii), a Majority in Interest of Class A Members shall have
full authority unilaterally to determine the number of Directors to
constitute the Board (which number of Directors may be increased or
decreased by a Majority in Interest of Class A Members) and the
term of office in connection thereto. Subject to Section
3.3(b)(ii), a Majority in Interest of Class A Members shall have
full authority unilaterally to appoint such individuals to be
Directors as they shall choose in their discretion. Subject to any
limitations then set forth in the Issuer Limited Partnership
Agreement, a Majority in Interest of Class A Members shall have
full authority unilaterally to remove and replace any Director,
with or without cause, at any time and for any reason or no reason,
and to fill any positions created by the Board as a result of an
increase in the size of the Board or vacancies. So long as the
Company shall serve as the general partner of the Issuer, a
majority of the Directors shall be “independent” as
that term is defined in the rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the “ NYSE ”) from time to time (the
“ Independent Directors ”). Each Director
appointed shall hold office until a successor is appointed and
qualified or until such Director’s earlier death, resignation
or removal. Directors need not be Members.

(ii)

     Upon the occurrence of a
Nonpayment, the number of Directors then constituting the Board
will automatically be increased by two and the holders of Voting
Preferred Units, voting as a single class, will have the right to
elect these two additional Directors at a meeting of the holders of
such Voting Preferred Units in accordance with, and subject to, the
Issuer Limited Partnership Agreement. When quarterly distributions
have been declared and paid on the Preferred Units for four
consecutive quarters following the Nonpayment, the right of the
holders of the Voting Preferred Units to elect these two additional
Directors will automatically cease, the terms of office of these
two Directors will forthwith terminate immediately and the number
of Directors constituting the Board will automatically be reduced
by two. However, the right of the holders of the Voting Preferred
Units to elect two additional Directors shall again vest if and
whenever any subsequent Nonpayment shall occur. To the extent that
the provisions of the Issuer Limited Partnership Agreement relating
to the election and removal of Directors upon a Nonpayment
conflicts with this Agreement, such provisions of the Issuer
Limited Partnership Agreement shall control. The holders of the Voting Preferred Units
, voting together as a class, may
remove any director elected by the holders of the Voting
Preferred Units . 
Notwithstanding Section 9.2 of this Agreement, the approval of the
requisite votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding
Voting Preferred Units as set forth in Section 16.8(c) of the
Issuer Limited Partnership Agreement is required in order to amend,
alter or repeal this Section 3.3(b)(ii). The provisions of this
Section 3.3(b)(ii) shall inure to the benefit of the holders of the
Voting Preferred Units, and each such holder is an intended
third-party beneficiary of this Section 3.3(b)(ii).

(c)     
Any Director may resign
at any time by giving notice of such Director’s resignation
in writing or by electronic transmission to the Designated Members
or any Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Board or the Secretary of the
Board. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified
therein, or if the time when it shall become effective shall not be
specified therein, then it shall take effect immediately upon its
receipt by the Company. Unless otherwise specified therein, the
acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

(d)     
The Board shall have
the authority to fix the compensation of Directors or to establish
policies for the compensation of Directors and for the
reimbursement of expenses of Directors, in each case, in connection
with services provided by Directors to the Company. The Directors
may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at such meeting
of the Board and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each
meeting of the Board or a stated salary as Director. No such
payment shall preclude any Director from serving the Company in any
other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of
special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for
attending committee meetings, or their service as committee members
may be compensated as part of their stated salary as a
Director.

(e)     
The Board may hold
meetings, both regular and special, within or outside the State of
Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice
at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board. Special meetings of the Board may be
called by any Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Board or, in the
absence of a Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Board, by any Director
on at least twenty-four (24) hours’ (or less in times of
emergency) notice to each Director, either personally or by
telephone or by mail, telegraph, telex, cable, wireless or other
form of communication at such time and at such place as shall from
time

 


 




 11


 


to time be determined
by the Board. Notice of any such meeting need not be given to any
Director, however, if waived by such Director in writing or by
telegraph, telex, cable, wireless or other form of communication,
or if such Director shall be present at such meeting. A Majority in
Interest of Class A Members may appoint a “Chairman,”
“Co-Chairman,” “Vice Chairman” and
“Secretary” of the Board. At each meeting of the Board,
any Chairman or Co-Chairman of the Board or, in the absence of a
Chairman or Co‑Chairman of the Board, a Director chosen by a
majority of the Directors present, shall act as chairman of the
meeting. In case the Secretary of the Board shall be absent from
any meeting of the Board, a Director or Officer chosen by a
majority of the Directors present shall act as secretary of the
meeting.

(f)     
At all meetings of the
Board, a majority of the then total number of Directors shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as
otherwise provided in any other provision of this Agreement, the
act of a majority of the then total number of Directors shall be
the act of the Board. If a quorum shall not be present at any
meeting of the Board, the Directors present at such meeting may
adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present.

(g)     
If a Director abstains
from voting on any matter in which he or she has a conflict of
interest, the vote of a majority of the then total number of
Directors who have not so abstained shall be the act of the
Board.

(h)     
Except as expressly set
forth herein, the Board may, by resolution or resolutions passed by
a majority of the then total number of members of the Board,
designate one (1) or more committees, each committee to consist of
one (1) or more of the Directors of the Company, which, to the
extent provided in such resolution or resolutions, shall have and
may exercise, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
powers and authority of the Board granted hereunder. A majority of
all the members of any such committee may determine its action and
fix the time and place, if any, of its meetings and specify what
notice thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the Board shall
otherwise provide. The Board shall have power to change the members
of any such committee at any time, to fill vacancies and to
discharge any such committee, either with or without cause, at any
time. The Board may designate one (1) or more Directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence
or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not such members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and
report the same to the Board when required.

(i)     
So long as the Company
shall serve as the general partner of the Issuer:

(i)     
the Board shall have an
Audit Committee of the Board; such committee shall have and
exercise such power and authority as the Board shall specify from
time to time; upon consideration of the criteria contained in
Section 10A(m)(3) and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”),
and Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, in each case
including any amendments, replacements or successors thereto, each
Director that is a member of such committee shall be independent;
and

each Director that is a
member of such committee shall be “financially
literate” pursuant to the requirements of Section 303A.07 of
the NYSE Listed Company Manual, including any amendments,
replacements or successors thereto;

(ii)

     the Board shall have a Conflicts
Committee of the Board; such committee shall have and exercise such
power and authority as the Board shall specify from time to time;
upon consideration of the criteria contained in Section 10A(m)(3)
and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Section 303A of the
NYSE Listed Company Manual, in each case including any amendments,
