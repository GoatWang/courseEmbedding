Location: Brasserie 8 , 9 West 57th Street New York, NY 10019 United States Agenda: To consider and vote upon the approval of a new investment advisory contract between the corporation and Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc.; and to consider any other business that may properly come before the Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof.


Sequoia Fund Wins Dismissal of Lawsuit over Huge Valeant Stake
Feb 25 17
A New York state judge has dismissed a lawsuit accusing the Sequoia Fund, known for its ties to Warren Buffett, of recklessly making a huge, disastrous investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, causing billions of dollars of losses. Justice O. Peter Sherwood of the State Supreme Court in White Plains, New York, said Sequoia shareholders failed to show it would have been futile, prior to suing in January 2016, to demand that the mutual fund's directors step in to unwind the investment because of their alleged conflicts of interest. The judge said the shareholders could try to amend their complaint, but that this appeared to be "a fool's errand." Sherwood issued his ruling during a Feb. 15 hearing. A transcript was made public eight days later. Sequoia shareholders had sued Sequoia's Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb; portfolio managers Robert Goldfarb and David Poppe; and three directors including author and chairman Roger Lowenstein. The defendants were accused of gross negligence for letting Sequoia plow nearly one-third of its assets into Valeant, despite a policy capping its stake at 25%. Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Valeant shares have tumbled 93% in the last 1-1/2 years amid criticism of the Canadian drug company's pricing and business practices, and regulatory and congressional probes. Goldfarb, who co-managed Sequoia for 36 years, retired as Ruane, Cunniff's chief executive last March. Sequoia sold its last Valeant shares in June, but its losses have left it still trailing 98% of its peers over five years, while assets have shrunk by more than half to USD 4.2 billion.

 About Us
                    Sequoia Fund is a mutual fund advised by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc since its founding in 1969. In managing the Fund, Ruane, Cunniff pursues a value-oriented approach, seeking to outperform over the long-term by purchasing shares, at prices below our estimated range of their intrinsic values, in high-quality businesses that have significant and durable competitive advantages and that we believe can compound the Fund's capital at attractive rates over the long-term.

We invest with the mindset of a business owner, because we believe that the only reliable way to value stocks and invest in them successfully is to think of them as interests in the long-term profits of a business.

The long-term perspective we take informs how we think, what we do, and how we construct our portfolios. We focus exclusively on things we can understand, like the quality of a business franchise, the competence of a management team, and the structure of an industry, rather than factors we consider inherently unpredictable, like the direction of the economy or the sentiment of the stock market.

We spend virtually all of our time researching the strengths, weaknesses and prospects of individual companies. Because this work is painstaking and difficult, we focus our holdings on a small group of businesses. This focus allows us to know what we own, and should also allow us to outperform if we use our research to make thoughtful judgments.

The 71-year-old Mr. Goldfarb was the longtime leader of Sequoia Fund Inc., a well-known investment product with historical ties to Warren Buffett. The fund had lost 10.9% through Tuesday and has underperformed 98% of its peers so far this year,...

Sequoia Fund, Inc.

QUARTERLY REPORTFor the Period Ended March 31, 2009

To the Shareholders of Sequoia Fund, Inc.:

As of this writing, the Sequoia Fund is up 0.2% year-to-date versus a decline of 0.5% for the S&P500.We recently held our annual investor day for Sequoia shareholders and other clients of Ruane, Cunniff&Goldfarb. The following comments were made by Bob Goldfarb at that meeting. A transcript of the question-and-answer portion of the meeting will be mailed to you with the second quarter report in August.The seeds of the housing bubble were planted in the early years of this decade by the Federal Reserve, whenit reduced interest rates down close to zero in an effort to mitigate the severity of the recession that followedthe bursting of the dot-com bubble. Now, we are concerned that the necessary massive leveraging recentlytaken on by the U.S. government in order to offset the enormous deleveraging by the private sector may containthe germination of the next bubble. The prospect of borrowing year-after-year at a high single-digit/low double-digit percentage of GDP will result in the U.S. government facing its own debt crisis. Lurching from one crisisto another, addressing each crisis by planting the seeds of the next one, is not a good idea.The U.S. government has two enormous advantages over the private sector. It has the power to tax and ithas the ability to print currency that the rest of the world will accept. However, there will be seriousconsequences to using either of these tools excessively going forward.A partial solution to funding the debt will be a welcome increase in the savings rates of Americans. Formore than 40 years after World War II the U.S. personal savings rate generally hovered between 8-10 percentof household income, with spikes up to 14 percent in recessions. Beginning in the late 1980s the personalsavings rate began to trend downward, finally turning negative in 2005. The savings rate had not previouslybeen negative since 1933, at the depths of the Great Depression.After hovering near zero in recent years, the personal savings rate quickly rose to 3.8 percent of income inDecember2008. In each of the first three months of 2009 it has been between 4 and 4.5 percent. The suddenupward movement in the savings rate has corresponded with an abrupt decline in the demand for consumergoods. The recent leveling off of the savings rate also squares with the stabilization in sales that a number of retailers of low-ticket non-durable goods (such as Target) are currently experiencing.At this point, we do not know whether the savings rate will stabilize between 4 and 5 percent or revert tothe high single digit rate that was the norm for many decades. The marginal propensity of the consumer tosave more and spend less has very significant implications for the future growth rate of the economy as wellas for future earnings levels and growth rates of many companies.We are seeing other changes in consumer behavior that we suspect are largely structural in nature, as webelieve is the increase in savings. A simple example: the growth of private label brands poses a real threat tomany branded consumer products companies. Although private label market share typically rises duringrecessions and then contracts in more healthy times, we think that this time much of the growth in privatelabel is likely to be sustained. Once you realize that the laundry and the dishes look the same when you useCostco’s Kirkland Signature detergent instead of Tide or Cascade, you will probably reduce your purchases of Procter& Gamble goods by a couple hundred dollars a year. If millions of people make the same decision,it will result in significantly less revenue and less pricing power for Procter& Gamble and its competitors, andmore power and possibly higher profit margins for the large retailers.Another example of pricing sensitivity affecting industry dynamics is in private passenger auto insurance.Historically the direct writers, led by Berkshire’s Geico and our former holding Progressive, have enjoyedsteady growth in market share at the expense of the captive writers such as State Farm and Allstate. In recentmonths, however, the direct response writers have enjoyed a growth spurt in terms of new policies written.There are some indications that this growth is coming at the expense of not only the captive channel but also767 Fifth Avenue, Suite 4701New York, NY 10153(800) 686-6884



















 

the independent agency channel, which had been relatively stable for many years. If the shift toward the directwriters continues, it will impact not only the top-line growth of the captive writers, and possibly the agencychannel, but will also affect their margins. More shopping means retentions are lower and policy lives shorter.Profitability is extremely sensitive to policy lives as renewals are a lot more profitable than new policies.Clearly the consumer is looking for ways to save money. In this regard, we feel that some of our holdingsare very well positioned. These would certainly include the retailers Wal-Mart and Costco, as well as TJX, andclearly Berkshire’s Geico is going to be a winner. These businesses are low cost providers and have beengaining market share in the last year, with TJX and Geico particularly strong in recent months. For example,in AprilTJX’s Marshalls and TJ Maxx stores generated same store sales growth of 4 percent versus a negative9 percent for Macy’s and a negative 6 percent for Kohl’s. We cannot remember when the spread between TJX’ssame store comparisons and those of Macy’s and Kohl’s were as wide as they were in April. This bodes wellfor TJX because, unlike most apparel retailers, its traffic counts have been up.TJX typically gains new shoppers during recessions and tends to keep them even as conditions improve. If the consumer remains stretched, they are even more likely to retain them. I would not bet on that same spreadcontinuing month after month, year after year, but it will be interesting to watch going forward.As we have mentioned in our prior letters to you, we did reduce our exposure to stocks of consumerdiscretionary companies in 2008. In 2009 there has been a further reduction and, as we said in our last letter,we are operating with a bias toward further reducing our consumer discretionary investments, subject, of course, to fluctuations in stock prices. But as the illustrations I have given you indicate, we do not think allconsumer discretionary stocks or companies are necessarily going to be disadvantaged, even in a much moreaustere and frugal environment for consumers. Clearly TJX, Costco and Wal-Mart have benefited. One of ourbest performers in the last 12 months has been O’Reilly Automotive, whose sales have benefited from the lowlevel of new car sales and the resulting need for many owners of older cars to finally undertake long-deferredmaintenance if they want to keep driving. Just as these trends in consumer behavior will not adversely affect all consumer discretionary businesses,it is not simply consumer discretionary businesses that will continue to be adversely affected by the trends weare seeing in the economy. We see numerous strong companies in many other industries suffering frommassively contracting demand and corresponding declines in sales and earnings. Illinois Tool Works, a formerholding of ours, reported organic revenues for the three months ended April30 of negative 23 percent. Thisis a figure we would not have dreamt of before last October.In this environment, we find it very challenging to ascertain normalized earnings power for manycompanies – both those we own and those that we are considering owning – when we are not sure what“normal” will look like in the future.We are not alone here. We have met with a number of CEOs of companies which we either own or areconsidering owning. When we ask them to estimate their companies normalized earnings power, many willvolunteer that they do not know. When pressed to give a broad range, oftentimes they cannot, and usuallydecline to opine.Valuing companies without knowing their earning power is like flying into a dense fog without instruments.In our many years of investing, we cannot remember a time when visibility was this low and estimating theintrinsic value of businesses was this challenging.As a result of significant realized capital losses through the date of this letter, we may not have a capitalgains distribution during the year ended December31, 2009. We will soon be distributing an ordinarydividend of approximately $0.01per share. It is possible that there may be a modest income distribution inthe fourth quarter.Sincerely,Richard T. CunniffRobert D. GoldfarbDavid M. PoppeVice ChairmanPresidentExecutive Vice PresidentMay22, 2009
