In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Proud to partner
The External Managers Group collaborates with Portfolio Management, Risk and internal asset class teams to align our areas of focus and contribute to overall investment results. Allstate seeks to partner with external asset managers to implement strategies that complement our internally managed portfolio exposures. In some cases this includes asset classes where we do not have in-house expertise or we have chosen to augment our capabilities through the use of external managers.
We take a disciplined approach to underwriting external partners. In addition to a thorough understanding of specific investment expertise, our due diligence takes into consideration the potential to leverage the relationship beyond the mandate in question. Our most successful partnerships have enabled us to tap into the breadth and depth of resources that our partners possess.
As we implement new relationships, we require strong communication and data-sharing capabilities to ensure that risk and exposures are properly reflected in our internal systems. While the initial start-up process can be time-consuming, we feel the benefits gained are key to building a successful partnership and delivering investment results for Allstate.


      Our External Managers team allows us to augment our existing capabilities in order to generate additional value for Allstate. We are sophisticated investors and work with external managers as partners to help us extend our capabilities and take advantage of market opportunities.

 Strategic allocation, dynamic risk

Our portfolio management begins with our global economic and market outlook, which informs a quantitative modeling process that balances risk and return, factoring in elements such as diversification, duration, liquidity and capital.
We overlay key global themes and trends and invite a variety of diverse perspectives as we make asset allocation decisions. Our portfolio managers then assess fundamentals, valuations and technical factors across markets to generate strong returns through the investment cycle.

Underwriting attractive investments
Our team primarily focuses on sourcing fixed income investments that offer attractive returns and high book yields over an intermediate investment horizon. With a flexible mandate and an experienced team, opportunities are sought across the capital structure and across the ratings spectrum. Our current focus is on higher book yields, with an emphasis on deal structure and asset value to protect principal.
We use a multi-sourcing strategy to originate and underwrite attractive investments, pursuing one-off club deals with like-minded investors, syndicated offerings using our Street contacts and scalable lending relationships with selective strategic partners. We leverage Allstate’s broad and experienced team of in-house professionals, including sector specialists, risk management, and legal expertise.
We’re currently pursuing the below strategies.
Private Credit/Middle Market Loans
Allstate’s portfolio objective is to pursue intermediate term lending opportunities in fixed or floating rate private debt and middle market loans. While primarily focused on senior, senior secured and first-lien opportunities, we also selectively pursue attractive subordinated or second-lien investments. Transactions are not required to be rated. Underlying asset types may include corporate balance sheet lending, project finance and transportation equipment financing.
Our return goal is to realize higher absolute returns in comparison to owning a diversified portfolio of public high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans. Incremental return factors include illiquidity, structural complexity and subordination.
We anticipate the portfolio having 80% – 100% first-lien/senior secured and up to 20% second-lien/mezzanine.









Agent Lending
Allstate agency owners advise customers on how to protect what matters most to them. We’re proud to support our new and existing agencies by offering financing so they can achieve their business goals and grow their businesses.
Our agent lending group provides term loan financing to new and existing agents for the purchase of an agency. The term loan allows existing agents to combine current debt and office improvement costs into one loan.
The agency line of credit product supports working capital needs.  The line of credit funds advances to an established agent’s existing bank account and takes payments electronically from the same account.
Forms and additional information on the loan program can be found here.

Reach Your Financial Goals.
Sometimes life can get in the way of saving for your future, and it's hard to know how to prioritize your goals. Allstate agents offer a variety of choices to help you and your family put your financial goals within reach. 
When building a financial plan, there are a few steps you can take to help make the process easier. Start with your current financial situation and assess how you're budgeting and saving. Then think about your goals and priorities and turn them into simple, achievable goals. Have a conversation with an Allstate personal financial representative that can help you put together a big-picture strategy for your financial future. You can also get important facts about an Allstate personal financial representative's background on FINRA's BrokerCheck website.

Get Help Building Your Financial Plan.

There's a lot to know when preparing for retirement or making a financial plan. Learn more about the financial solutions and options available so you can make an informed decision about your future:

529 College Savings Plan: Each state chooses an investment company to manage its plans, but you can participate in any state's plan. You can have funds automatically set aside for your tax-free savings, so you can cover the cost of tuition and books down the road.1
Annuities: Build your retirement savings with this long-term investment. Allstate agents offer various types of annuities that can offer tax-deferred growth with the potential for guaranteed income in retirement. 

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Help your retirement savings grow faster than similar taxable investments with IRA options such as Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs or Rollover IRAs. 
Mutual Funds: Save for retirement or college with a mutual fund managed by professional financial advisors. Determine your savings plan based on objectives like your savings goals and your ability to handle risk.
Life Insurance: Life insurance may not be top of mind when you're thinking about building a financial plan, but permanent life insurance offers a cash value investment feature for you to withdraw from or borrow against under certain circumstances.2

1 Please note that Allstate Life Insurance Company or its agents and representatives cannot give legal or tax advice. The brief discussion of taxes on this page may not be complete or current. The laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. For complete details consult your attorney or tax advisor.
 
2 Partial withdrawals and surrenders from life policies are generally taxed as ordinary income to the extent the withdrawal exceeds your investment in the contract, which is also called the "basis." In some situations, partial withdrawals during the first 15 policy years may result in taxable income prior to recovery of the investment in the contract. Loans are generally not taxable if taken from a life insurance policy that is not a modified endowment contract (MEC). However, when cash values are used to repay a loan, the transaction is treated like a withdrawal and taxed accordingly. Unpaid interest on loans is added to the loan principal, thereby increasing the total debt on the policy. The combination of an increasing loan balance and deductions for contract charges and fees may cause the policy to lapse, triggering ordinary income tax on the outstanding loan balance to the extent it exceeds the cost basis in the policy. Loans, if not repaid, and withdrawals reduce the policy's death benefit and cash surrender value. 
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. You should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment options before purchasing a contract or investing money. These contracts have limitations and are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains important information about the annuity contract, including fees and charges, investment options, death benefits, and annuity payout options. Optional income riders carry additional costs and may have limitations or restrictions. To obtain a prospectus or the underlying portfolio prospectuses, please contact your Allstate Personal Financial Representative. Please read the product prospectuses carefully before purchasing a contract or sending money. Guarantees offered are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing company.

Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
