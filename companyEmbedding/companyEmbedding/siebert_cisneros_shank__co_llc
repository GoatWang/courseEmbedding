Corporate 






In November 2014 Siebert Cisneros Shank acquired Siebert Capital Markets. This acquisition expanded Siebert Cisneros Shank’s product and service offerings from its focus on municipals to include corporate investment banking, both debt & equity, corporate share repurchase and equity execution.

Debt and Equity Capital MarketsCorporate Share RepurchaseDebt and Equity Capital MarketsDebt and Equity Capital Markets
Siebert Cisneros Shank’s mission is to provide a unique, comprehensive and value-added platform for our clients’ investment banking needs. The professionals on our team have on average over 25 years of experience on Wall Street. We provide a fully integrated origination, sales, trading, and distribution platform for an extensive array of products including corporate, agency, preferred, money-market instruments, equity, and securitized products.
The Capital Markets Group has participated in over $1 Trillion of both global corporate bond and equity transactions since 2004, for a wide variety of companies. Issuer coverage extends across a range of automotive, financial, industrial and utility clients.
Siebert Cisneros Shank has both middle market institutional and retail distribution. This retail distribution consists of small and high net worth investors that have consistently generated substantial demand on our retail-targeted products—IPOs, follow-ons and preferred stock offerings. Our institutional client base consists of primarily Tier 1 and middle market accounts which invest in a variety of asset classes. These clients consist of mutual fund complexes, asset managers, insurance companies, trust companies, and public pension systems. The strength of Siebert Cisneros Shank’s institutional distribution platform lies in its coverage of 2nd and 3rd tier accounts which are sometimes underserved by the larger investment banks, allowing us to bring significant added value to our clients’ transactions.
Corporate Share RepurchaseCorporate Share Repurchase
Siebert Brandford Shank’s Capital Markets Group has a strong track record and extensive experience working with companies in executing their corporate share repurchase programs. Over the past ten years, we have helped repurchase over 432 million shares, representing $25 billion in principal amount for a variety of Fortune-rated companies. Our team has distinguished itself in this product offering, demonstrating that small firms can compete effectively. The Capital Markets Group was awarded “Best Share Repurchase Agent” for 3 years in a row by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
