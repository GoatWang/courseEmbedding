Odey


















To be a successful long term investor you must think like an owner - know when to take risk and when to preserve capital.

I launched Odey Asset Management in 1991 with this 'owners' approach and have worked hard to build an investment team and a client base who share these beliefs. Today we manage c. $6.0bn* for many of the world's leading investors and have an exceptional performance record across our conventional and hedge fund portfolios (* as at 30 June 2017).

If you would like to learn more about us, please do get in touch.

States unless those persons or entities are existing investors in

Accordingly, all persons who access this site are required to
inform themselves of and to comply with all applicable sales
restrictions in their home country. 
Sales Restrictions
United Kingdom: certain of the funds referred to in the
restricted part of this site (the "Restricted Area") more commonly
known as hedge funds are not recognised collective investment
schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 of the United Kingdom (the "Act"). The promotion of such funds
and the distribution of offering materials in relation to such
funds in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law.

available to and directed only at persons to whom such funds may
lawfully be promoted by a person authorised under the Act (an
"authorised person") by virtue of Section 238(5) of the Act and

The hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not regulated under
the UK's financial services regulations and investors in those

the Act for the protection of investors or from the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme.
Shares in the hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not dealt
in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the
purposes of the Act, nor is there a market maker in such shares,

shares.

this site should only be made having read fully the relevant

on this site, you should contact your financial adviser.
Risk Factors

performance. The value of investments and the income from them may
go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount
invested. Consequently, you are not certain to make a profit on
your investments and you may lose money.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area may be subject to higher
risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.
Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and
the income arising from them to rise or fall.
The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change.
Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their
value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor.
Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to
understand any applicable tax consequences.

Sales Restrictions
United Kingdom: certain of the funds referred to in the

risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.

Robin Crispin William Odey (born January 1959)[2][3] is a London-based hedge fund manager and the founding partner of Odey Asset Management. In April 2011 the firm had $6.5 to $7 billion under management, with Odey personally running $4 billion of assets.[4]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]

He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning

By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
