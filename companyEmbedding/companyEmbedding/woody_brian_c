										Brian C. Woody contacted me to provide notary and courier services to the Secretary of State for his business, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners.  To add credibility to the telephone conversation and request, Brian invoked the name of business associate known to have perfect integrity. Based on the integrity of the business associate, I performed all requested services, and advanced the Secretary of State filing fee on his behalf, which was never repaid. Im absolutely amazed that one friend would besmirch the good name of another, and that Brian cannot afford to pay the $50 fee advanced on his behalf.  Had I looked closer, I would have noticed that Brian C. Woody hides behind Legal Zoom as The Agent for Service of Process, and fails to provide an accurate business address for service for small claims court filings.  He must have a lot to hide or has gotten very good at ducking out on his financial obligations. I am more amazed at the lack of conscience and moral fiber.  How does one ignore daily e-mail requests for payment?  I hope Brian learns the words, honesty, integrity, ethics, values and standards and incorporates them into his business model. You should contact your good buddy, JJ, and figure out how to pay the measly $50 fee I advanced to you, you big, corporate giant, you.

AUTHOR: Notary -  () SUBMITTED: Friday, March 28, 2014 POSTED: Friday, March 28, 2014   For all of the lying and bloviating, Brian C. Woody still hadn’t paid the $50.    Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #2 Author of original report  Brian Woody - Put up, or Shut up Time AUTHOR: Notary -  (United States of America) SUBMITTED: Thursday, March 07, 2013 POSTED: Thursday, March 07, 2013  
														Thank you for verifying that payment(s) have not cleared your financial institution.  Typically, payments are issued by the business entity; however, to obtain a business checking account, the entity must be in good standing with the Secretary of State, have current Statement of Officers on file, and have money on deposit.   Under certain circumstances, a business entity, such as Brian C. Wood, Managing Partner, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners do not qualify and must rely on cashiers or personal checks.  In this instance, funds were advanced on behalf of Brian C. Wood, Managing Partner, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners, who failed to repay the debt. Upon receipt of proof of payment, or overpayment, a refund and a well-deserved, public apology will be issued.  Until such time, you may seek financial redress through the County of Sacramento, Small Claims Division where the alleged extortion would have occurred.  Please be certain to attach copies of the negotiated cashiers checks to the court filing. To receive a refund of the purported overpayment, forward copies of the negotiated instruments as proof of payments and the correct mailing address to mail the refund.  Until such time, Im looking forward to further communication with the undisclosed local authorities, California Secretary of State, Attorney General, and the Fraud investigations unit at Wells Fargo.  Extort - Definition of EXTORT: to obtain from a person by ingenuity or compelling argument Paying a business debt is a compelling argument, dont you agree? Rule of the board: DO NOT sign your name, or include any e-mail addresses in the report.       Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #3 REBUTTAL Owner of company  Katrina Arnaud Notary Sacramento Extortionist! AUTHOR: B woody -  (U.S.A.) SUBMITTED: Wednesday, March 06, 2013 POSTED: Wednesday, March 06, 2013  
														Katrina Arnaud, I merely copied and reposted a link to your current rip off report, looks like you must really have something to hide seeing as how you refuse to use your name in any and all of your posts to prevent people from finding the real truth about you and your criminal ways. Your small minded attempts to use this posting format to Extort more money are failing miserably, I have sent you you your payment of $50.00 three separate times now and have the receipts to prove, I also have a letter from our bank Wells Fargo showing that three separate chashiers checks have been cashed at a Bank of America surprisingly with in miles of you home address. Your continued attempts to threaten and extort me or my company have failed, so give up you poor pathetic thief and go find another victim like the realtor guy you screwed over in your own home town! Also your bullshit about notaries submitting to background checks only pertains to the initial application, after which you can pretty much committ as much fraud as possible until enough evidence mounts, and then the investigations began. Sounds like your getting close to that point so good luck with that, and I have in fact  reported you to the local authorities, California Secetary of State, Attorney General, and the Fraud investigations unit at Wells Fargo.													   Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #4 Author of original report  Brian C. Wood says, Johnnie wet my pants. AUTHOR: Notary -  (United States of America) SUBMITTED: Monday, February 25, 2013 POSTED: Monday, February 25, 2013   Scurrilous, libelous accusations dont obviate the responsibility to pay a miniscule, legitimate business debt.  Unfortunately, buffooneries and coarsely presented libelous, jocular comments represent U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners and forebode the careless business practices one might expect from a company that engages in such dialogue.Brian C. Wood, Managing Partner, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners failed to pay for contracted courier services.  To intimate identity theft is the equivalent of, Johnnie wet my pants. Notaries submit to a Department of Justice and FBI background investigations prior to receiving a commission.  If Brian C. Wood, Managing Partner, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners believes there is a violation of the public trust, the correct venue to report said infraction is the State of California, Secretary of State, Debra Bowen at www.sos.ca.gov. Please find a copy of your last communication committing to repay the fees advanced on your behalf.06/01/2012Katrina, thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today, I look forward to making this situation right.Best,Brian C.

In Feb of this year I purchased a used 2008 BMW 550i. The dealership offered an extended warranty through Interstate National Dealer Services (INDS, Inc.), I opted for the Copper Coverage Plan at $3000 up front price tag since it had fairly good coverage of most parts that fail on BMW's. It was a 3 yr/42, 000 mile warranty. ...

They refunded the ...

Big City Bride is absolutely the worst wedding planning service in Chicago, if not in America. This place is all style, no substance; all talk, no walk.

Complaint / review text:Brian C. Woody contacted me to provide notary and courier services to the Secretary of State for his business, U T Equity Group, LLC and Symbolic Capital Partners. To add credibility to the telephone conversation and request, Brian invoked the name of business associate known to have perfect integrity.Based on the integrity of the business associate, I performed all requested services, and advanced the Secretary of State filing fee on his behalf, which was never repaid.Im absolutely amazed that one friend would besmirch the good name of another, and that Brian cannot afford to pay the $50 fee advanced on his behalf.Had I looked closer, I would have noticed that Brian C. Woody hides behind Legal Zoom as The Agent for Service of Process, and fails to provide an accurate business address for service for small claims court filings. He must have a lot to hide or has gotten very good at ducking out on his financial obligations.I am more amazed at the lack of conscience and moral fiber. How does one ignore daily e-mail requests for payment? I hope Brian learns the words, honesty, integrity, ethics, values and standards and incorporates them into his business model.You should contact your good buddy, JJ, and figure out how to pay the measly $50 fee I advanced to you, you big, corporate giant, you.
