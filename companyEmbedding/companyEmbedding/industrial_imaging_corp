I told him the number I was looking for and he said that seems ok, but I will check with my accountant and talk with my partner. A couple of days later I received the call stating I got the position and another person was brought on as well. Had another conversation about my salary and was again told the pay rate was ok, even though the accountant hasn't got back with him. I was informed that the office they had rented out was under construction and should be around 30 days from completion. I was fine with that since I knew up front. he said he was going to bring me in a couple days early to perform training that he said was going to be paid.On two separate conversations I asked on how the company was wanting me train/teach/mentor/help out the other new person to be successful (which I would have loved to do so). its day 30 by now and construction has been delayed but we still meet for a lunch meeting where he wanted to basically renegotiate the salary by decreasing it $700 a month, but the commission would stay the same. red flag 1 At that same lunch meeting he stated it disturbed him that I asked how he would like for me to mentor the other new employee with very little sales experience twice. I was confused at this point hence the inside sales manager position title and assuming that teaching some sales techniques would fall under the positions responsibilities. Red Flag 2Day 45 or so by now and finally its the first day to start.

Flat Panel Detectors (DR)
 
Flat Panel Detectors for Digital Radiography (DR) have gained popularity in the last few years. Flat Panel detectors are currently used on a range of systems from high energy systems (25 MeV) to microfocus (sub micron imaging systems). Current technological developments have resulted from the adoption of Flat Panel technology in advanced specialized medical equipment such as Accuray’sCyberKnife Treatment Planning system andVarian’s advanced 3D imaging and radiation therapy equipment.
Flat Panel Detectors are slowly replacing image intensifiers in today industrial and medical equipment. Flat Panel detector offer several advantage over image intensifiers including:

Lower signal to noise ratio.
No pin cushion distortion.
Adjustable Frame rate.
Scintillator optimization.
Wider dynamic range.
Improved spatial resolution

Proper scintillator selection is very important for optimal Flat Panel performance. Scintillator’s can improve the gain, photon capture at high kV (MeV range), spatial resolution. There are also specialized scintillator for neutron radiography. Contact one of our level III engineers to discuss your scintillator needs. IIS will will work with you to provide a customized Flat Panel detector for optimal high energy, neutron or modified system that meets your specific needs.
If you are interested in converting your existing real time system (Image Intensifier based system) to a digital system, the team at IIS can help you make the conversion.

Computed Radiography (CR)
 
Computed Radiography technology employs Imaging plates (Phosphor plates), which, similar to classic X-Ray film, when irradiated, store a latent radiographic image for an unspecified period of time. The image plate is then inserted into a specialized scanner. A laser beam scans the imaging plate with a pre-selected scanning resolution to digitize the latent image, before it is sent to a high resolution computer for post processing. After the scan, it is possible to erase the latent mage. This is done with an integrated unit. This plate can then be rescued to create another image.
Computed Radiography (CR) is rapidly displacing x-ray film use in the medical and industrial markets. This rapid replacement of film is driven by the inherent advantages of CR technology.
 
 


Computed RadiographyAdvantagesAdditional Information




 

CR technology is a green replacement for film.
CR technology does not utilize hazards chemicals/materials.
Imaging plates are reusable (no consumable).
Return on investment (ROI) is very good.
Image quality is comparable to film
Dynamic range is superior to that of film
Flaw detection is as good better than film
CR technology is more time efficient than traditional film
Industry standards are now in place for CR replacement of film
CR imaging plates have a superior dynamic range when compared to conventional films, resulting in exposure times that are only 10% of the equivalent exposure time for AGFA D7 film
Dark Room no longer required. CR plates can be handled in indirect light.
Industry leading technology from Fuji and AllPro.

 
US Air Force commissioned ARInc to investigate the replacement of x-ray film with CR. The resulting paper compares defect detection and the cost of using CR vs film. To download the Air Force research white paper follow this link replacing film with CR.
Not to be outdone the US Navy also documented their finding on converting to CR. To download a copy of the Navy presentation follow this link to CR in the Pacific Northwest
This white paper is an interesting article on the use of CR in restoring paintings.
This paper was written for medical radiographers however it is a very good discussion on basic CR principles
This is one of the better presentations on industrial radiography adoption of CR by Dr. U. Zscherpel / BAM Berlin.
 
 
 
 
 


CR is the digital imaging process that is nearly a plug and play replacement for x-ray film and like film you can need to select the CR system that best meets the needs of your application. IIS will work with you to help you select the ideal CR system.
 
 
 
 



Ultra High Resolution
 
This is our ultra high resolution CR scanner with spatial resolution grater than twenty line pars per mm (>20 lp/mm). To obtain this high resolution, the scanner needs special High Resolution Phosphor Storage Plate (PSP). Using a standard PSP yields a resolution comparable to the NDT unit shown above. It is designed to work with Phosphor Storage Plate (PSP) in all common film sizes, up to fourteen inches wide. It also works with custom sized plates (i.e. 2 x 72 inch) plates for panoramic weld inspection. This unit is normally configured with a desktop work station and a high resolution high contrast twenty one inch LCD display, but can be adapted to other specifications.
 
 

CR Emergency Response (EOD) Unit
 
This rugged and durable portable unit is ideal for field use. The system can handle Phosphor Storage Plates (PSP) in all common film sizes up to twelve inches wide as well as customized PSP. For field use it is configured with a Panasonic Toughbook computer and the IIS Iview software. This scanner works equally well for low output pulsed sources like the Golden Engineering unit or with isotope sources.
 
 

CR Non Destructive Test (NDT) High Contrast
 
This scanner most popular with our NDT customers. It works well with all types of sources including: microfocus, linear accelerators and isotope. It is designed to work with Phosphor Storage Plate (PSP) in all common film sizes, up to fourteen inches wide. It also works with custom sized plates (i.e. 2 x 72 inch) plates for panoramic weld inspection. This unit is normally configured with a desktop work station and a high resolution high contrast twenty-one inch LCD display, but can be adapted to other specifications.
 
 
 


If you are unsure what is the best CR unit for your needs contact one of our Level III Engineer for advice or to schedule a demo.
 
 
 
 



Linear Diode Arrays
 
Linear Diode Arrays (LDA) are one of the older and most widely used digital imagers. LDA’s are utilize a a scintillator directly coupled to a photo diode to convert the x-rays into an electronic signal. This direct couple configuration allow for collimating of each pixel. The columniation of each pixel allows for thicker scintillator with out getting scintillator blur. With thicker scintillator these imagers become ideal for high speed imaging and low dose applications. This is why LDA images are commonly used in conveyer fed imaging systems. The collimated pixels with thick scintillator are the imager of choice for CT and Cargo inspection system. as the provide superior signal to noise ratio.
 
 


Linear Diode ArraysLDA Advantages




 

High speed imaging, No blur at high speed
Significantly higher frame rates that allow for higher speed part manipulation
Inherent noise rejection, superior signal to noise ratio
High dynamic range (larger denser parts)
Custom sizes and resolutions are cost effectively built.
Thicker scintillators for high energy applications.

 
 
 
 
 


Contact one of our Level III Engineer to discuss how to implement a custom LDA in your x-ray system.
