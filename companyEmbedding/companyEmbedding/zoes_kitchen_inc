History[edit]
Zoës Kitchen was originally incorporated in Jefferson County Probate Court in June 1995 as Zoe's Kitchen, Inc.[2] Founded by Zoë and Marcus Cassimus.[3] Originally, the restaurants were not franchised, with Cassimus retaining a 51 percent ownership stake in all newly opened locations.[4]
Its first location would open in October 1995 in downtown Homewood.[5] A second location opening in the Riverchase section of Hoover in 1999 and a third in downtown Birmingham in March 2001.[3] The restaurant would continue its expansion with the opening of its first store outside the Birmingham area in Tuscaloosa in May 2001 and its first out-of-state location in Nashville, Tennessee in the fall of 2001.[6] By 2006, Zoës had expanded to sixteen restaurants, with eight located in Alabama and others located in Phoenix, Nashville, Memphis, Baton Rouge and Destin.[7]
With 20 stores open by 2007, Cassimus would sell a majority ownership stake to Brentwood Associates of Los Angeles.[8] Following the purchase, Cassimus announced that he would remain as chief executive, the company would remain headquartered in Birmingham and that the menu would not be affected. Additionally it was revealed that the sale could potentially result in the opening of 200 new franchises over the next five years.[8] By Spring 2008 GE Capital Solutions loaned the company $10 million to allow for the development of 50 new stores across the southeast and southwest.[9]
In November 2008, Cassimus would resign with Greg Dollarhyde taking his place as CEO.[10] Formerly the CEO of Baja Fresh, Dollarhyde announced that he will be looking to expand the restaurant to new locales with two-thirds remaining company owned and the remainder being franchised.[10]
Kevin Miles, who joined Zoës in 2009 after working at Luby’s, Pollo Campero and Baja Fresh, succeeded Greg Dollarhyde as president in March 2011.
As of August 2011, Zoës has 11 franchised stores and the rest are company-owned [41]. Miles announced that Zoës would consider multi-unit franchisees in the future.
Zoës launched online ordering in 2011 and a mobile loyalty app in 2013.
Miles promised that the company would stay headquartered in Birmingham (the city where the company was founded and a majority of employees were located), in 2011.[11] In 2014, though, when the company announced that it was going to be publicly traded,[12] SEC filings showed the headquarters as Plano, Texas.[13] Reasons given for the shift included simplifying travel, a lack of talent available in Birmingham (the talent source for the companies initial growth and development), and the need to consolidate offices to prepare for an IPO. Local media, business, and civic leaders said they were unaware of the move.
Menu[edit]
Generally Zoës focuses on a limited menu primarily designed to attract lunchtime and early evening customers.[4] The menu is Greek-influenced and serves a variety of chicken salad, pasta salad, pitas and grilled chicken sandwiches.[14] Zoës offers self-serve style fountain drinks, in addition to bottled beverages, milk, juices and hot tea. Vegetarian and vegan options are also available.[15]
At Zoës, customers can dine in, order online or call ahead for takeout; purchase a variety of fully prepared Dinner for Four (now called Mediterranean Family Meals); pick up side dishes by the pint; and take advantage of the extensive catering menu, which includes box lunches, party trays and meals for large groups that can be delivered locally.
Locations[edit]
As of March 2015, Zoës Kitchen has 171 locations throughout seventeen states of the United States.[16]
Catering[edit]
Each location is staffed with a fully trained Catering Sales Manager. From office lunches to large events, Zoës will deliver an assortment of fresh food. A rewards program is also available to frequent customers. [17]

History[edit]
Zoës Kitchen was originally incorporated in Jefferson County Probate Court in June 1995 as Zoe's Kitchen, Inc.[2] Founded by Zoë and Marcus Cassimus.[3] Originally, the restaurants were not franchised, with Cassimus retaining a 51 percent ownership stake in all newly opened locations.[4]
Its first location would open in October 1995 in downtown Homewood.[5] A second location opening in the Riverchase section of Hoover in 1999 and a third in downtown Birmingham in March 2001.[3] The restaurant would continue its expansion with the opening of its first store outside the Birmingham area in Tuscaloosa in May 2001 and its first out-of-state location in Nashville, Tennessee in the fall of 2001.[6] By 2006, Zoës had expanded to sixteen restaurants, with eight located in Alabama and others located in Phoenix, Nashville, Memphis, Baton Rouge and Destin.[7]
With 20 stores open by 2007, Cassimus would sell a majority ownership stake to Brentwood Associates of Los Angeles.[8] Following the purchase, Cassimus announced that he would remain as chief executive, the company would remain headquartered in Birmingham and that the menu would not be affected. Additionally it was revealed that the sale could potentially result in the opening of 200 new franchises over the next five years.[8] By Spring 2008 GE Capital Solutions loaned the company $10 million to allow for the development of 50 new stores across the southeast and southwest.[9]
In November 2008, Cassimus would resign with Greg Dollarhyde taking his place as CEO.[10] Formerly the CEO of Baja Fresh, Dollarhyde announced that he will be looking to expand the restaurant to new locales with two-thirds remaining company owned and the remainder being franchised.[10]
Kevin Miles, who joined Zoës in 2009 after working at Luby’s, Pollo Campero and Baja Fresh, succeeded Greg Dollarhyde as president in March 2011.
As of August 2011, Zoës has 11 franchised stores and the rest are company-owned [41]. Miles announced that Zoës would consider multi-unit franchisees in the future.
Zoës launched online ordering in 2011 and a mobile loyalty app in 2013.
Miles promised that the company would stay headquartered in Birmingham (the city where the company was founded and a majority of employees were located), in 2011.[11] In 2014, though, when the company announced that it was going to be publicly traded,[12] SEC filings showed the headquarters as Plano, Texas.[13] Reasons given for the shift included simplifying travel, a lack of talent available in Birmingham (the talent source for the companies initial growth and development), and the need to consolidate offices to prepare for an IPO. Local media, business, and civic leaders said they were unaware of the move.
Menu[edit]
Generally Zoës focuses on a limited menu primarily designed to attract lunchtime and early evening customers.[4] The menu is Greek-influenced and serves a variety of chicken salad, pasta salad, pitas and grilled chicken sandwiches.[14] Zoës offers self-serve style fountain drinks, in addition to bottled beverages, milk, juices and hot tea. Vegetarian and vegan options are also available.[15]
At Zoës, customers can dine in, order online or call ahead for takeout; purchase a variety of fully prepared Dinner for Four (now called Mediterranean Family Meals); pick up side dishes by the pint; and take advantage of the extensive catering menu, which includes box lunches, party trays and meals for large groups that can be delivered locally.
Locations[edit]
As of March 2015, Zoës Kitchen has 171 locations throughout seventeen states of the United States.[16]
Catering[edit]
Each location is staffed with a fully trained Catering Sales Manager. From office lunches to large events, Zoës will deliver an assortment of fresh food. A rewards program is also available to frequent customers. [17]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

History[edit]
Zoës Kitchen was originally incorporated in Jefferson County Probate Court in June 1995 as Zoe's Kitchen, Inc.[2] Founded by Zoë and Marcus Cassimus.[3] Originally, the restaurants were not franchised, with Cassimus retaining a 51 percent ownership stake in all newly opened locations.[4]
Its first location would open in October 1995 in downtown Homewood.[5] A second location opening in the Riverchase section of Hoover in 1999 and a third in downtown Birmingham in March 2001.[3] The restaurant would continue its expansion with the opening of its first store outside the Birmingham area in Tuscaloosa in May 2001 and its first out-of-state location in Nashville, Tennessee in the fall of 2001.[6] By 2006, Zoës had expanded to sixteen restaurants, with eight located in Alabama and others located in Phoenix, Nashville, Memphis, Baton Rouge and Destin.[7]
With 20 stores open by 2007, Cassimus would sell a majority ownership stake to Brentwood Associates of Los Angeles.[8] Following the purchase, Cassimus announced that he would remain as chief executive, the company would remain headquartered in Birmingham and that the menu would not be affected. Additionally it was revealed that the sale could potentially result in the opening of 200 new franchises over the next five years.[8] By Spring 2008 GE Capital Solutions loaned the company $10 million to allow for the development of 50 new stores across the southeast and southwest.[9]
In November 2008, Cassimus would resign with Greg Dollarhyde taking his place as CEO.[10] Formerly the CEO of Baja Fresh, Dollarhyde announced that he will be looking to expand the restaurant to new locales with two-thirds remaining company owned and the remainder being franchised.[10]
Kevin Miles, who joined Zoës in 2009 after working at Luby’s, Pollo Campero and Baja Fresh, succeeded Greg Dollarhyde as president in March 2011.
As of August 2011, Zoës has 11 franchised stores and the rest are company-owned [41]. Miles announced that Zoës would consider multi-unit franchisees in the future.
Zoës launched online ordering in 2011 and a mobile loyalty app in 2013.
Miles promised that the company would stay headquartered in Birmingham (the city where the company was founded and a majority of employees were located), in 2011.[11] In 2014, though, when the company announced that it was going to be publicly traded,[12] SEC filings showed the headquarters as Plano, Texas.[13] Reasons given for the shift included simplifying travel, a lack of talent available in Birmingham (the talent source for the companies initial growth and development), and the need to consolidate offices to prepare for an IPO. Local media, business, and civic leaders said they were unaware of the move.
Menu[edit]
Generally Zoës focuses on a limited menu primarily designed to attract lunchtime and early evening customers.[4] The menu is Greek-influenced and serves a variety of chicken salad, pasta salad, pitas and grilled chicken sandwiches.[14] Zoës offers self-serve style fountain drinks, in addition to bottled beverages, milk, juices and hot tea. Vegetarian and vegan options are also available.[15]
At Zoës, customers can dine in, order online or call ahead for takeout; purchase a variety of fully prepared Dinner for Four (now called Mediterranean Family Meals); pick up side dishes by the pint; and take advantage of the extensive catering menu, which includes box lunches, party trays and meals for large groups that can be delivered locally.
Locations[edit]
As of March 2015, Zoës Kitchen has 171 locations throughout seventeen states of the United States.[16]
Catering[edit]
Each location is staffed with a fully trained Catering Sales Manager. From office lunches to large events, Zoës will deliver an assortment of fresh food. A rewards program is also available to frequent customers. [17]
