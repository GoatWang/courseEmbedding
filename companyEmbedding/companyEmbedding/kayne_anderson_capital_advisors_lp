Kayne Partners Backs Atlas RFID


 











Atlas RFID has received an undisclosed investment from Kayne Partners, the growth private equity group of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors. Based in Birmingham, Alabama, Atlas monitors the status and availability of materials for capital construction projects.
PRESS RELEASE – JANUARY 8, 2015
LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Atlas RFID announced today that Kayne Partners has invested in the company to support the growth of its Auto-Identification-based materials tracking and management solution for the construction industry focused on Oil, Gas and Chemical (“OG&C”), Power and Mining markets. Kayne Partners is the growth private equity group of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P., an approximately $29 billion alternative investment firm.
“The Jovix™ solution designed by Atlas RFID couples third-party hardware with its proprietary software to provide a fully integrated solution. We believe Atlas is well positioned to take advantage of the growth potential in the market and we continue to be impressed with the Atlas management team.”
Headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, Atlas helps large-scale construction firms save time and money by accurately monitoring the status and availability of materials for capital construction projects. Founded in 2007 by Robert Fuqua (Chief Executive Officer), Atlas provides auto identification tagging and monitoring services on global projects with capital expenditures of at least $500 million.
Atlas RFID sells its proprietary mobile material control solution to Engineering Procurement Construction (“EPC”) companies as well as to the owners of OG&C, power and mining construction projects. Utilizing technologies such as GPS, RFID and barcodes (“Auto-Identification” or “Auto-ID”), Atlas digitizes and automates jobsites, providing unprecedented visibility into the complex industrial construction supply chain.
“Through our proprietary software platform, Jovix™, Atlas has established itself as the world’s leading provider for site-level materials management technology for large-scale industrial construction projects,” said Robert Fuqua, Founder and CEO of Atlas. “We take great pride in the quality of our product and our team. Therefore, we are extremely pleased to work with a distinguished capital partner such as Kayne Partners who mirrors our high standards, commitment to excellence, and unwavering resolve for financial success. Furthermore, the overlap between Kayne Partners’ investment portfolio and the Jovix™ market creates an immediate strategic advantage that dramatically enhances the value of our firm. We are excited to have the opportunity to partner with Kayne to accomplish an aggressive growth plan in the coming years.”
“Kayne Partners strives to identify and partner with companies uniquely positioned in industries that are underserved from a technology perspective. Implementations of auto identification tracking technologies and solutions have increased the efficiencies on construction sites by providing significant time, labor, and material-use improvements,” said Nishita Pawar, Managing Director, Kayne Partners. “The Jovix™ solution designed by Atlas RFID couples third-party hardware with its proprietary software to provide a fully integrated solution. We believe Atlas is well positioned to take advantage of the growth potential in the market and we continue to be impressed with the Atlas management team.”
“Kayne Partners has a proven history of working with companies in high growth industries and backing competent and strategically focused management teams. We are excited about our partnership with Atlas RFID,” said David Walsh, Managing Partner, Kayne Partners.
