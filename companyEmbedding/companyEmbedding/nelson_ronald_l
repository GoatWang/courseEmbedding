At the out set, this appeared as an “open and shut” case as I saw it.  As the case unfolded, I quickly learned that nothing is open and shut.  When you obtain an attorney, it is important that you have responsible representation and that your attorney is going to fight for your rights and not settle for the easiest and quickest way out.  If you do not know an attorney and have limited knowledge of the legal process, finding adequate council can be like playing Russian roulette.  I was fortunate enough to have lived in the Pensacola area for the past 40 years and knew some key people that recommended that my daughter obtain Tim to represent her.  In my lifetime I have had to obtain legal help and have dealt with numerous attorneys.  Tim Nusser fought for my daughter and came prepared on the “day of confrontation”.  I can honestly say, without hesitation, that Tim is the best family law attorney my daughter could have had.  My granddaughter is a happy, well adjusted PATS student living with her mother.  Thank you Tim.Nusser Timothyjoycelmoss ratedMr. Nusser was an excellent attorney. He and his staff were very patient compassionate and always remained professional doing my divorce case. I honestly do not feel I would have survived my divorce proceedings had I not had Mr. Nusser as my attorney especially with all the unpleasantries of dealing with the court system and opposing counsel. He remained calm and professional at all times and really kept me grounded at times when I could really have flown off the handle. I am sure I was not his only client at any given time but he and his staff always made me feel like my case was the most important case they had. I have recommended him to several friends already and I highly recommend him to anyone needing assistance with family law matters especially divorce issues. thank you again, Mr. Nusser, Dee and CyndiRandall J Etheridge EsquireDiane H. ratedI am unbelievably thankful that we chose Randall Etheridge as our attorney! He is powerful, knowledgeable and concise. A man who knows the laws and who is well respected in court. His ability to traverse the thick waters of the legal world and have a genuine care for his clients as well as his ability to maintain his client base with professionalism, makes him bar none, the best. When we met I was very scared, under financial duress and passionate about taking care of those I loved. Our case was a touchy, sensitive one, difficult to say the least. He always gave me an understanding of the process and always returned our calls promptly. He believed in us, when no one else did! Nusser Timothyjeffrey.prichard ratedI am so very thankful to a friend of mine for referring Mr. Nusser. A divorce is stressful enough but having the right attorney makes a huge difference. Notwithstanding the usual; qualifications  etc. Mr Nusser's strongest attribute is that he listens to you and what you want. While every case is different, he made mine almost effortless on my part. He gave me world class attention and got the results I was looking for. I would strongly recommend that anyone seeking a divorce attorney to consider him and at least have a consultation.  Thanks again Tim, you gave me my life back and made the whole process as good as it could have been. You are the BEST!!The Watson FirmErick U. rated"He is the best trial Attorney I have ever worked with and I've been here 38 years!"When I was in a car accident a few years ago I chose a law firm with the reputation as the best in the area and that is when I met Aaron Watson. When Mr. Watson decided to open The Watson Firm I had a choice to make. Do I stay with the firm with the extensive history of success or continue on with Mr Watson? The above quote responding to my query of should I stay or go affirmed my decision to continue with Mr Watson. After seeing his effectiveness speaking on my behalf and life changing settlement I truly believe​ he is the very best lawyer in Pensacola..... Period!!!Bruce Childers, Attorney at LawAngie B. ratedI would definitely recommend Bruce Childers as a divorce lawyer to anyone who needs one. I was going through a very ugly separation and felt I needed to get advice on how to proceed with a divorce. Bruce’s advice and counseling provided me with the expert information I needed. My biggest concerns were a property I inherited before I was married and access to my two kids. Bruce not only secured these for me but also negotiated a few other things that I was not considering. All in all this firm provided me with expert help at a time that was very traumatic for me and would highly recommend them.Thank you, again Bruce!Morris, BartTater W. ratedCar Accident My Name Is Tatreal Watson And Im Writing On The Behalf Of My Fiance Terry Terrell Crenshaw Who Is In The Escambia County Jail He Was In A Accident While Been In The Jail He's Been Suffering With Back Pain And Has Been Asking To Go To The Hospital But No One Has Taking Him To Have It Seen About In The Last Month He Hasnt Been Asking To Go Because There Not Trying To Do Anything For Him And Me Myself Ive Been Calling Up There So If You Could Can You Give Me A Call To Let Me Know The Best Thing To Do Please ... Thank You And Have A Bless And Wonderful Day Terrycrenshaw11@gmail.com 8507238858 Nusser TimothyDebbie M. ratedMr Nusser and staff got me through the most difficult time in my life. I work in the health field so medical I understand, but legal things I dont. Tim and staff were so very good at explaining to me everything that was going to happen in terms I understood. When my husband filed for divorce behind my back I thought for sure my life was over. Thanks to Mr Nusser and his team I am ok and doing better every day. I would tell anyone that wants to hire an attorney that has his clients best interest in mind and will do his best for you, then you can't do better than Mr Nusser! Nusser Timothydrbillmartin ratedTim was professional and empathetic (without the arrogance you can deduct from some attorney's TV commercials)! He listened, explained the process, and kept me in the loop throughout the whole ordeal. He always did what he said he was going to do, and always in a very timely fashion. He kept the proceedings very informal yet exuded confidence. If you want a compassionate attorney with a boatload of experience to help you through a very difficult time, and you want to feel like a real person and not a number, then I highly recommend Tim and his law firm.Bowden Steven W & Associates PAHank H. ratedWhen I left my abusive relationship my parents said get a bull dog to protect my child. I didn't understand what I was being asked to do. They explained that a bull dog sinks his teeth in and doesn't let go, or break under pressure. That is Mr. Bowden! He sunk his teeth into my ex's lawyer, never buckling under the pressures of litigation and stupid requests by his lawyer. In the end we got even more than we expected. Thank you for protecting my child and helping me out of abusive marriage. This is the one you should always get! Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
