Extended Interview: Bruce Downey
September 3, 2001 at 12:00 AM EDT 
[Sorry, the video for this story has expired, but you can still read the transcript below. ]




 
 

 
 EMAIL







SUSAN DENTZER: How will [a generic version of Prozac, or fluoxetine,] be priced?
BRUCE DOWNEY: Generally, the–a sole source generic is discounted 25 to 40 percent off the brand price.
SUSAN DENTZER: So consumers could expect to see substantial savings, then?
BRUCE DOWNEY: They can see–their savings will come in two steps. The first step is when we’re on the market as an exclusive generic, it will be less expensive than the Lilly product, and then once that six months of exclusivity expires, additional competitors are authorized to enter the market and there’ll be another substantial discount at that time. So their discounts will be seen over two periods, one now and one six months from now.
SUSAN DENTZER: And how much competition are you expecting to come in in that time.
BRUCE DOWNEY: I think there are seven or eight companies ready to, to enter the market once the exclusivity runs. So there’ll be substantial competition at that point in time.
SUSAN DENTZER: And at that point what happens to this product in terms of what it does for your profitability?
BRUCE DOWNEY: Well, it’ll reduce it. We expect–we do, however, expect to remain the, sort of the dominant player in the Prozac, generic Prozac market. We’ll be in every drug store in America. We’ll be defending that market share against competitors, and, and we’ll continue to be the market leader in the product.
SUSAN DENTZER: What lessons does this whole experience tell us about–there are many large drugs which are about to come off patent in future years, and Lilly’s behavior, as you said has been somewhat unusual.
What, what–what do you think? What lessons can we derive from this whole experience about future patent expirations?
BRUCE DOWNEY: Well, I would expect in future expirations, expiries, you’ll see companies more aggressive than Lilly’s been. I mean, that’s my expectation in terms of preserving their market. But I think this shows a couple of things. One, a determined generic company in this market does have the resources and the will to take on these challenges and bring the products to market, and I would expect not only Barr, but many of our larger competitors to, to continue to press these issues and bring products to market, and so I think consumers can rest assured that they’ll get access as they expect to.
I’d add one other lesson, is that it shows that the provision of the law that grants six months of exclusivity as a reward for successfully challenge the patents–whoops–I mean, if it wasn’t for that reward period, there’d be no willingness on our part, or any other large company’s part, to invest all of the money and time, and effort into the patent challenge.
You’d simply pursue other product opportunities and, and sit back and wait for the patents to expire, and that would allow these strategies of getting add-on patents to be successful. So the reward system here really is the key to what’s happened and I think it shows that, that it works.
SUSAN DENTZER: Why is this a less challenging issue, converting people, now, over to the generic formulation?
BRUCE DOWNEY: Well, I think that there are two reasons. One, they’re such–so, so visible and so well-publicized, that people understand the availability of the product, earlier in the product life cycle than a normal generic launch. So the awareness of pharmacists and patients, of its being on the shelf, will bring them to accept the, the, you know, to ask for the generic product or dispense it, and there’s a corollary to that. Because it’s such a large product, there are financial incentives on, in the pharmacies to ensure the patients are aware of the product, and dispense the generic, because pharmacists, frankly, earn a higher margin or higher profit on, on generics than they do brand products, and so I think that those two factors combined will make this substitution easier than most.
SUSAN DENTZER: So for the CVS’s of the world, the Rite Aids of the world–
BRUCE DOWNEY: They have, they have–you know, it’s a great service to their patients and their customers to offer the equally good product at a lower cost, and it’s good business sense for them to do that because they earn a higher profit, so–
SUSAN DENTZER: You don’t think that the name Prozac is going to be of such power, that it’s going to block any of this transition to the generic formulation?
BRUCE DOWNEY: I think it will have very little impact; yes.
SUSAN DENTZER: You’re gonna earn a fair amount of money for at least six months off of this product.
BRUCE DOWNEY: Yes.
SUSAN DENTZER: What are you going to do with the proceeds of that?
BRUCE DOWNEY: Well, we have a very active R&D program, particularly on our proprietary side. We also are in a proprietary business and we have a number of clinical studies underway, or planned in the future, and this is going to allow us to accelerate our development in that area, and I think we’ll be able to make very good use of the proceeds.
SUSAN DENTZER: And in general terms, what areas of drug development are you engaged in?
BRUCE DOWNEY: For the most part, our efforts are centered on women’s health care, we have a proprietary oral contraceptive currently in development, we’re looking at some other–we just agreed to merge with Duramed. They have a hormone replacement product that we think’s a very good product, and some add-on products yet that, that need funding for the clinical trials. So we’re gonna continue to focus our proprietary efforts for the time-being in women’s health care, and that’s where the proceeds will go.

Presidents get sick and die. What happens next hasn’t always been clear
July 18, 2017    BY Dr. Howard Markel   
The Constitution describes the legal transfer of presidential power to the vice president if the former resigns or dies while in office.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Earnings Transcript: Mr. Bruce Downey - Barr Pharmaceuticals - Chairman and CEO
 
Carol Cox - Barr Pharmaceuticals - VP of Investor Relations: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Barr’s fiscal 2004 third quarter earnings conference call. Participating in today’s call are Bruce Downey, our Chairman and CEO; our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bill McKee; Paul Bisaro, Vice President and COO and Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, President and COO of Barr Research.
 
At today’s conference, we’ll provide an overview of the quarter followed by a review of the financial highlights and an outlook section by Bill. Following these comments we’ll open up the call for a question and answer period. The purpose of today’s call is to provide a review of the quarter ended march 31, 2004. To the extent today’s statements made by management during the company’s discussions contain information that is not historical these statements are essentially forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified. Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in today’s call. I would also like to remind investors that we incorporate on today’s call by reference the risks and uncertainties set forth under the heading “forward-looking statements” in our earnings release issued this morning that has been furnished to the SEC. today on Form 8-K at 7:00 a.m. And in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K in quarterly report on form 10-Q and filed with the SEC, all of which are available on the Investor Relations portion of the Barr Web site.
 
We will be happy to answer any questions following the formal presentation. However, as a matter of corporate policy, we will not comment on individual financial models or other information that we deem to be strategic to our competitive position. The company’s press release was issued at 7:45 a.m. Eastern Time and subsequently faxed or e-mailed to all of you who have requested to be added to our shareholder distribution list. I would also like to remind everyone that the conference call is being Web cast live and can be accessed on the Barr Web site at www.barrlabs.com. In addition, a replay of the call will be available from 12:00 noon Eastern Time today through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 30. Details on accessing the replay will be provided at the end of today’s call. I would like to introduce our Chairman, Bruce Downey.
 
Bruce Downey - Barr Pharmaceuticals - Chairman and CEO
 
Thank you, Carol. Good morning everyone. We had a very strong quarter again. 58 cents earnings per share on a split adjusted basis. That is also a GAAP adjusted basis versus 44 cents a year ago. For the nine months ended march 31, we earned $1.57 post-split per share on an adjusted GAAP basis versus $1.27 a share a year ago. The adjustments to the GAAP earnings are all detailed in our press release but for the most part relate to four  different product acquisitions, the product line we acquired last fall, Plan B in generics acquisitions which were completed this quarter, and the acquisition of the transactional ring or the acquisition of all of the remaining rights to that product which also occurred in this past quarter. Our revenues also were very strong, $321 million for the quarter versus $172 million a year ago. For the nine months ended march 31, our revenues were approximately $1 billion versus approximately $600 million a year ago. Bill will go through many of the individual financial items in the press release and the financial statements but there are two that I think are particularly noteworthy that I want to call your attention to. First, our manufacturing margins were again in the high 60% range. I think they remain the highest in the industry. We’re very proud of that accomplishment and we continue to focus on high margin products. And also our R&D spending is at an all-time high. Again I think something we’ve prided ourselves in that we’ve developed a very large number of attractive products and we think the level will continue to produce the products and allow us to continue to grow our business.
 
On the generic side of the house we had a very good quarter. We currently have 29 applications pending at the FDA. We’ve had 14 approvals this year, which it’s not the highest in the industry it certainly is among the top two or three in the industry. In a quarter we launched our 19th oral contraceptive product and have three more pending at the FDA. We have 50 products in development, approximately of those are 35 capsule products that incorporate not only just immediate release technologies but our sustained release technology, our liquid fill capabilities and the like. We also have now 15 products in development that uses other forms of drug delivery totaling as I said over 50 in all. The three items I’d like to call your attention to. Actually, that has occurred this quarter or will occur later this quarter that I think are noteworthy and we should bring to your attention. First I’d like to remind everyone that our exclusive distribution agreement on Ciprofloxacin ends June 8. Therefore, you could expect sales of that product to decline in this quarter and decline very significantly beyond this quarter. 
 
Second, just this week, in fact I think the release went out yesterday, we received approval for our generic Avcon products and we’ve optioned that as we disclosed in an earlier press release and now have 45 days to exercise that option and license the product on the exclusive basis for five years. If they decline to exercise that option we will be launching the product either late this quarter or early next quarter. And finally, we’ve also announced we’ve settled the two cases Tim herd and extra step cases which we had against a company for two patents. Of course, it provides no obstacle to anyone else who might want to challenge the product or the patents on those products and we think this was a very fair and good settlement, good for us, and good for our shareholders.
 
Our proprietary business also remains very strong. We had record sales in the quarter and a proprietary side of the business, we recognized the remaining revenue from the stocking orders to SEASONALE, which were shipped last fall. The scripts on SEASONALE to continue to grow nicely. They continue to track ahead of the launches of ortho tricycle on a basis-- therapy basis. We are very proud of that and we think the launch is going extremely well. We began our director consumer print media campaign in march. It’s continued ... continues to this day. We’ve so far had ads appearing in “People”, “Glamour” and “Cosmo” and “In style” and a number of magazines where we think the readership would be interested in the product. We will begin our radio and TV director consumer ad program later this summer. We think that ... and our market research has shown ... that when women go to their physician asking or inquiring about a particular contraceptive product, there is a very high probability they will leave the office with a prescription for that product. So, we want to make this option well known and well understood by women so they can consult a physician about the product and we think that will help us increase significantly our market share over time. I also mentioned in the comments about the adjustments to the GAAP earnings, two of the acquisitions were finished this quarter. The plan b acquisition and oxy-trans vaginal ring acquisition. On the plan b front, we are currently selling a product as an RX product; the produce date for the switch application date is May 20. We think not all of the questions at the FDA has asked about the product following the very successful advisory panel meeting and we are very optimistic and hopeful that we will receive approval on that date or approvable on that date. As is often the case when you get an approvable, they are still labeling issues to be negotiated particularly on a no TC switch application. So, an outright approval is probably not likely but an approvable subject to labeling negotiations is I guess the more realistic outcome. 
 
We continue a very aggressive development program in our proprietary side of the house. We will be - have completed or will be finishing shortly DP 3 extended oral contraception study and the vaginal estrogen cream study. The cream products should be filed in this quarter with the FDA The DP 3 products will be filed next quarter, the first  quarter of fiscal 2005 and we continue to have a full portfolio of our products going through our pipeline. So we’re very pleased with our progress in that area.
 
Finally, as we have said in our press release, we want to reaffirm guidance so that we have provided for this year a 20% to 25% increase over the record year that we had in fiscal 2003. This translates post-stock split into 53 to 60 cents for the current quarter when you do the math based on performance to date or on an annualized basis 210 to 218 for the year. And if you go back pre-split, that translates to 315 to 327 as earnings per share on the basis they were originally computed when we first gave the guidance last summer.
 
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill to provide more detail on the financial statements after which we’ll take questions from the audience. Being mindful that we have a commitment up here at CIBC, has a conference at 11:00, so we might not be quite as chatty today as we normally are. Bill, I want you to take the financial statement.
 
Bill McKee - Barr Pharmaceuticals - CFO: OK. Thank you, Bruce. Good morning everyone. I wanted to just take a minute and go through the adjustments, which are described in the press release. There were essentially two adjustments that affected the third quarter. Bruce mentioned one that affected also the nine months but in the quarter, essentially two charges the first of which was a 13% share charge resulting from the company’s decision to acquire Schering AG’s rights and obligation under the product development and license agreement with enhanced pharmaceuticals that Barr assumed in our June 2002 acquisition of enhanced. At the time of that acquisition, and based on the terms of that product development agreement, we had signed a fair value of approximately $27 million to that agreement. At the end of March, when Barr and Schering agreed Barr would acquire back the worldwide right to the product, we also agreed to forego remaining expense reimbursements, milestone payments and royalties and agreed to assume back all the remaining responsibilities for the development, filing and marketing of the product. As a result of that, a change in the terms of that product development agreement, even though we ultimately believe that the product is more valuable to us under the new terms, because of the change in the terms, we were required to write down, write off the remaining un-amortized value of that product development agreement, which amounted to about $22 million on a pretax basis and resulted in a 13 cent charge in the quarter. The second charge relates, is a combined charge of 12 cents in the quarter, resulting from our two transactions in the emergency contraception category, namely our acquisition of women’s capital corporation and the acquisition of certain assets of gynetics.
 
About 10 cents of that 12-cent charge relates to the IP R&D value we assigned to the pending application for the over-the-counter version of plan b and the remaining two cents arises from expensing the $4.2 million payment we made pursuant to our asset purchase agreement with gynetics. Both of those transactions, the women’s capital and the gynetics transactions were previously disclosed in a press release as was the charge and, as well, the Schering transaction, also, was previously disclosed and so, people looking for perhaps some additional information I would ask you to check the previous press releases on that.
 
Turning to the product sales area, leading the 87% increase in year over year sales or sales of Ciprofloxacin which totaled $85 million in the quarter, as we discussed at our analysts’ conference, a sequential decline in Cipro sales was expected and reflects the shift in customer buying patterns as we approach the end of Bayer’s pediatric exclusivity period in early June. Bruce mentioned in his opening comments, things to think about as you think about the fourth quarter and really continues to be consistent with what we anticipated and described at our analysts’ conference a few weeks back.
 
Generic product sales increased 21% to $193 million. Of that total, our generic c-line generated $102 million in sales, which was an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our other generic product sales increased 18%, climbing to $91 million. Contributing to that increase were sales of metazerpin, which we launched in December, 2003 and our sales of generic acutane, which we launched in May,2003.Proprietary product sales increased more than 300% year over year to $39 million led by about $15 million in SEASONALE revenue, which we launched in November. Contributions from products we acquired from Wyeth and higher year over year sales of Cenestin, which totaled $7.6 million in the quarter.
 
As Bruce mentioned, our SEASONALE sales for the quarter includes about $11.5 million that had been deferred at the time of launch. The year over year increase in Cenestin sales reflects a higher pricing and the unusually lower sales we recorded in the March quarter last year, due to customer buying patterns. For the nine-months, Cenestin sales totaled approximately $37 million and we now expect Cenestin sales for fiscal 2004 to exceed the high end of the range we previously had given of $40 million to $45 million development. Development and other revenue increased $1.5 million from the prior year to $4.4 million. Included in our development revenue this quarter is a $1 million payment made to us by Galen (ph) for their option to license our generic product and Bruce talked a little bit about that in his opening remarks. Also included in development and other revenue are reimbursements from Schering under our product development agreement and in line with my earlier comment, those reimbursements will cease beginning in the fourth quarter. An offset to that loss of revenue will be the fact that we have been incurring about $2.5 million of amortization charges on the intangible that has been written off. So, there will be an offset to the lost development revenue from Schering, which had been running about $500,000 to $700,000 a quarter.
 
Proceeds from our patent challenge settlements are down year over year as expected and I think as most of you know, those were proceeds we received under our distribution agreement relating to the settlement of our Ciprofloxacin and patent challenge and we - those payments ended when we began distributing the products, so we no longer recognize those proceeds from the patent challenge.
 
Margins on product sales, the overall margin on product sales for the quarter was about 54% compared to 67% the prior year. The decline year over year resulted from sales of Ciprofloxacin, which is both a distributed product and a product subject to a profit split, carries a lower margin than our other products. Our margins on products other than Cipro contributed margins in the high 60% range as Bruce mentioned earlier, up slightly compared to the same period a year ago. R&D expenses in the quarter were approximately $58.2 million up about $37 million from the prior year. That increase was driven by a $22 million write-off on the product development and licensing agreement I previously mentioned and the $10.2 million IP R&D charge related to women’s capital corp. Excluding those charges, our R&D spending still increased 21% compared to last year’s levels reflecting the higher costs associated with our increased product development activities, including increased third-party product development costs, higher raw material purchases, and an expansion in our proprietary product development staffing areas.SG&A costs for the quarter were approximately $57 million, up 22% or 65% from last year. This year over year increase was led by increasing advertising and promotional costs for SEASONALE, higher selling costs associated with our March 2003 expansion of our women’s healthcare sales force, higher legal costs primarily related to solve the arbitration and an increase in business development and other intellectual property matters. The SG&A also included the $4.2 million write-off related to gynetics which I mentioned earlier and also contributing to the increase for higher information technology costs including the initial costs of developing and implementing our new E.R.T.system. A tax rate in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 42.8% as compared to about 36% in the prior year. The tax rate for the quarter was unfavorably impacted by the writeoff of the I.P. R&D costs associated with the women’s capital acquisition, which is not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes. Excluding the impact of that nondeductible I.P. R&D amount, the effective tax rate in the quarter was about 36.6%.
 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities, totaled $486 million at march 31. Cash from operations for the three months ended March was about $52.5 million. Operating cash was generated principally by our net income adjusted for noncash charges including depreciation. And these items more than offset our increases in working capital. Our higher working capital in the quarter was primarily attributable to higher inventories, including higher Ciprofloxacin inventories, which result due to the timing of our purchases from buyer. These increases were offset by lower receivables due to Cipro sales in the quarter and the timing of sales within the quarter.
 
Capital spending was about 16.2 million in the quarter led by investments in our Information Technology product including the new ERP system and also include the costs to expand our SMMA production capabilities and packaging capacity. Bruce mentioned the outlook reiterating our guidance for 20% to 25%, resulting in a range, on a split adjusted basis, an adjusted basis of 2 cents at 218 and implied range of 53 to 61 cents for the quarter ending June 30. As we always remind everyone, that the range for the year and for the quarter don’t include any potential costs or revenues associated with any business development activities or legal settlements and so forth that may be completed by June 30. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Carol. 
 
Carol Cox - Barr Pharmaceuticals - VP of Investor Relations: Thank you, Bill. We’d like to open it now to a question and answer period please.
