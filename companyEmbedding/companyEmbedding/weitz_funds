Fact Sheets

Our mutual funds
Our equity funds are focused on finding long-term growth by seeking value wherever we find it.  Instead of building a fund to hit a predefined diversification target, we build our mutual funds one company at a time.  For our equity funds, that leads to a concentrated portfolio in which the top 10 holdings often have the greatest impact on performance.  When evaluating a potential equity investment, we investigate key aspects of the business, from its position in the marketplace to its management, in order to determine what a rational buyer would pay to own 100% of a company.  Generally, if a company is selling at least 30% below our estimated intrinsic value and meet our qualitative evaluation criteria we are interested.

Our fixed income funds are focused on income and capital preservation.  Like our equity funds, we build our fixed income funds one investment at a time. We cast a wide net across most bond investment classes to find opportunities
that meet our stringent criteria.  Rather than focusing only on yield, we seek out investments that we believe offer a reasonable risk adjusted return.  We study potential opportunities until we find the right investment at the right price.

Our moderate allocation fund’s goal is to generate current income and preserve capital while still pursuing some long-term growth opportunities.  It is a combination of our equity funds and fixed income funds strategies. Typically our equity holdings account for 40% to 60% of the portfolio with the top ten often having the greatest impact on performance.  The fund must have at least 25% of total assets invested in investment-grade bonds to offer income opportunities.  The fund may also invest up to 20% of its total assets in unrated or non-investment grade fixed income securities.

2Q17 Value Matters




July 5, 2017
2Q17 Value Matters
by Wally Weitz & Brad Hinton



July 5, 2017
 
Dear Fellow Investor,
Our equity Funds rose the first half of the year, including modest returns in the second quarter. Some outpaced their benchmarks, while others trailed. Our bond funds continued to find ways to earn some income in spite of continued (artificially) low interest rates. While our stock returns have been subpar in recent years, even if that were not the case, we would (as always) point readers to the longer-term results. Returns for all of our Funds over various intervals can be found on the performance table on our website.
Fund activities can be found by accessing the Quarterly Commentary link under each Fund’s section on our website. We have changed the format of our Quarterly Commentary to include reasoning behind portfolio changes rather than merely listing buys and sells, winners and losers. We hope this change will be helpful to shareholders.
Little has changed in our outlook as we cross the halfway mark of 2017. We continue to believe that stocks and bonds are expensive. The causes—central bank suppression of interest rates, the willingness of investors to “pay up” for earnings growth and excess corporate liquidity being used for share buybacks rather than capital spending—are not new, but the steady rise in the stock market without a meaningful correction has lasted an unusually long time. At the end of the quarter, there were some signs of price weakness in the tech sector leaders and upticks in bond yields, but it is probably premature to declare an end of the “bargain drought.”
Our Game Plan
Price distortions, including those caused by the growing popularity of indexing and ETFs, are making it hard to find investments at reasonable prices. This is annoying, but you pay us to “figure it out,” so complaining is not helpful. The question is, “What are we doing about it?”
Our “Holy Grail” is business value. If we can buy the stock of a growing business at a discount to the price that a smart business owner would pay for the whole company, our investment is very likely to be successful. The stocks that are “working” in this market are generally very good companies, but we believe that for many, stock prices are high enough that the odds are stacked against investors. Buying the best companies, regardless of price, worked—until it didn’t—with the “Nifty Fifty” in the 1970s, the tech/internet stocks of the late 1990s and the housing and mortgage-related financials in the mid-2000s.
To paraphrase Ben Graham, “Buying a great business at too high a price is a speculation.”

During this extended period of high valuations, the turnover in our stock funds has been low. We have added a few new stocks to our portfolios, but they tend to fall into the category of intermediate-term “trades” (as opposed to our preferred long-term “investments”). For example, DXC Technologies is the successor to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), an undermanaged and somewhat troubled IT consulting company that brought in new management in 2012. The new CEO, Mike Lawrie, has considerable turnaround experience and by 2016 had CSC back on track. Earlier this year, CSC acquired Hewlett Packard’s Enterprise Services business (originally Ross Perot’s EDS). The plan is to use the same playbook Lawrie used with CSC to make the combined company more profitable. If they are reasonably successful over the next three to four years, we believe that DXC can earn $9-10 per share and sell at a modest 12-13 times earnings. This is not “home run” material, but it would represent a nice increase over today’s $76 per share. More importantly, achieving these gains is not dependent on low interest rates, a strengthening economy or technological breakthroughs.
Most of our assets are invested in companies we have owned for many years, but the companies themselves have not been standing still. Berkshire Hathaway has been in our clients’ accounts continuously since 1976, but today’s Berkshire is very different from that of 40, 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. Recent headlines trumpet Berkshire’s $12 billion profit on its Bank of America (BAC) investment. In fact, that investment was made in 2011 when Buffett lent BAC a badly needed $5 billion. Berkshire received a convertible preferred stock with a 6% yield ($300 million per year) convertible into BAC shares worth over $17 billion today. Berkshire’s internal rate of return on this investment is about 18% per year.
Berkshire currently holds about $100 billion in cash available for future deals. Investments like BAC (and similar lifelines thrown to Goldman Sachs and General Electric (GE) in 2008) are rare and tend to arise in times of economic stress. Neither we nor Warren can predict when the next “deal” will present itself, but Warren and his investment team are both patient in waiting for great opportunities and bold in seizing them.
The various Liberty entities offer a variety of subscription-based cash flow generators. Liberty Global is a large European cable company, which we think is very undervalued at $31 vs. our estimated value of $43. Its Latin American assets will soon be spun off into a separate company, and we expect the Liberty management to use the same consolidation “playbook” to build a valuable Latin American version of Liberty Global. Investors have been disappointed by the recent pace of quarterly progress at both Global and the Latin American subsidiary, LiLAC, but we believe that putting strong, subscription-based businesses in the hands of Liberty management is a great prescription for building business value.
Liberty’s ownership in SiriusXM (Liberty SiriusXM Group) dates back to 2009 and the depths of the Great Recession. Sirius was on the brink of bankruptcy and Liberty lent them about $400 million. The loan had a very high yield (and was repaid in under a year) but also included a “kicker” in the form of a virtually free option to acquire 40% of the company. That option was exercised and is now worth over $10 billion. Management is busily working on extracting full value from the Liberty holding company that owns its Sirius stake.
Cable TV and broadband internet providers are among our favorite types of businesses, and Charter Cable is the second-largest cable company in the U.S. Charter recently purchased Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks and is integrating them into the Charter system. This process will take another two to three years, and when completed, Charter’s shares should be worth considerably more than the current $337. We do not own Charter directly, but we do own it indirectly through Liberty Broadband and Liberty Ventures.
Liberty Broadband is a pure play on Charter, holding about 0.3 shares of Charter for every Broadband share. Ventures is a holding company that owns Charter shares and Liberty Broadband shares. The shares of both Broadband and Ventures offer ways to buy Charter at a discount to its current price. If Charter’s value increases, we should be doubly rewarded as Liberty extracts full value for the Charter shares we have bought at a discount. Nothing is ever simple with Liberty and John Malone, but investors are generally very well-served.
The message in these investment vignettes is not that our stocks are terribly cheap. The weighted-average price-to-value of our portfolios is in the mid-upper 80% range—somewhat higher than usual. What gives us comfort, though, is that the businesses are solid and their values are growing. Their stock prices will not be immune from panicky market corrections, but if their prices fall, we will have a basis for stepping in and adding to our positions. The financial press is full of stories about the “death” of value investing—or even of any kind of active management. We still believe that it is more sensible to pick stocks based on valuation than on market capitalization, and we plan to stick to our investment philosophy.
Warren Buffett likes to describe the stock market as analogous to a baseball game in which there is no umpire calling balls and strikes. The batter (investor) can stand at the plate and let pitches (stocks) go by indefinitely, “waiting for his pitch” (a bargain investment). Meanwhile, the fans in the stands are screaming, “Swing, you bum!” We may have been too picky at times, and the cash reserves we hold have come with an opportunity cost, but we believe in our investment process. We are not asleep at the plate—our on-deck list grows by the week. The raw material for triggering market volatility is in place, and we are looking forward to taking advantage of it. In the meantime, we are grateful for a patient group of shareholders with long-term perspectives.
 
Best regards,
          
Wally Weitz                     Brad Hinton

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Weitz Funds' Analyst Corner: A Perspective on Dollar Tree Inc.David Perkins, research analyst and co-manager of the Value FundMay 18, 2017 |  About: 
DLTR  +0%



Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) operates a network of approximately 14,400 discount variety stores across the United States and Canada under the Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada and Family Dollar brands. During the summer of 2015, Dollar Tree completed a transformational acquisition of competitor Family Dollar Stores for $8.8 billion and now operates under two distinct banners. The legacy Dollar Tree segment operates 6,400 stores, offering everyday basics, seasonal, closeout and promotional merchandise at a fixed $1 price point ($1.25 CAD in Canada). The Family Dollar segment operates approximately 8,000 general merchandise discount retail stores focused on providing customers basic necessities such as diapers, food and paper products as well as seasonal merchandise at prices between $1 and $10.Value & ConvenienceThe dollar store model was born in the 1950s, targeting small ticket (typically less than $10), weekly “fill-in” visits between larger trips to the grocery store (and later, mass merchants like Wal-Mart). Small stores (6,000-10,000 square-feet) with a narrower selection of lower priced goods allowed dollar stores to operate economically in close proximity to customers. This combination of value and convenience resonated with lower- to middle-income American consumers, leading to a doubling in the number of dollar stores across the country since 2003. As their reach expanded, dollar stores generated sales comparable to that of grocers and mass merchants on the 7,000 items stocked, providing the opportunity to buy those same products at similar discounts. At the same time, low-cost, efficient store footprints allowed dollar stores to build local density, lowering logistics costs. As a result, dollar stores offer convenience at equal or lower prices versus their larger grocery and mass store competitors. They also match the relative ease of drug and convenience stores, but with 20-40% lower prices. These twin advantages have proven a durable niche, allowing dollar stores to generate consistent growth, attractive returns on capital and significant excess cash flow.The Giving TreeThe legacy Dollar Tree banner is the last remaining true dollar store where every item is a dollar. Dollar Tree prides itself on being a ‘variety store,’ aiming to strike a balance between consumables such as food and toilet paper and more discretionary items such as toys, stationery, party supplies and holiday décor. Dollar Tree describes its core customer as “a woman on the go, with household income of $40,000+ balancing work, home and family”. The Dollar Tree concept has proven effective in serving this core customer in communities of all sizes, with remarkably consistent and attractive financial results. Same-store sales have risen in 22 of the past 23 years with store payback periods between two and three years (pre-tax), among the most attractive in retail. Dollar Tree has intentionally shared a meaningful portion of these scale benefits with customers in the form of higher quantity and/or better quality for the customers’ dollar. We believe the company should comfortably grow square footage at a 3-5% annual clip over the next 5-10 years, driving solid mid-single-digit profit growth.Improving Family DollarFor most of the past decade, Family Dollar’s operating performance has lagged that of peers Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Much of that underperformance can be traced to two costly strategic errors. First, in response to burgeoning demand following the ’08-09 financial crisis, the company embarked upon an aggressive multi-year store expansion plan by increasing density in existing markets and introducing new Family Dollar stores into middle and upper-middle class suburban markets. The expansion cannibalized its existing store base, raised costs and pressured margins. With same-store sales falling and store productivity declining, Family Dollar made its second mistake– abandoning its everyday low price (EDLP) model in favor of a ‘high-low’ promotional pricing strategy aimed at reigniting store traffic. Gross margins fell further, leading to unsustainable cost cuts including maintenance deferral and already thin in-store labor. Pressure to sell the company mounted, culminating in activist investor Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio) purchasing a 10% stake in the company and demanding its sale.Dollar Tree ultimately won the ensuing and well-chronicled battle for Family Dollar. A key question for Dollar Tree investors is whether the problems it inherited at Family Dollar are structural–a combination of a suboptimal real estate footprint, damaged brand and undifferentiated product offering–or the result of a series of strategic missteps that can be gradually undone. Answering this question is nuanced, but we believe Family Dollar should return to historical operating margin levels (roughly 8%) over the next several years under the Dollar Tree leadership team’s care. Returning Family Dollar to an EDLP pricing model, improving its store merchandise (more private label and $1 price points) and in-stock levels, catching up on deferred maintenance, fixing in-store staffing levels and rebannering underperforming stores should lead to a gradual improvement in profitability. Longer-term, supply chain opportunities could result in Family Dollar closing the margin gap with consumable-heavy peer Dollar General.Durable Retail?Retailing is a notoriously difficult business. Creating lasting value requires continual reinvestment, extreme cost consciousness, painful evolution and competitive paranoia. We believe Dollar Tree demonstrates these traits. Discount retail is becoming more competitive with low-margin, hard discounters like Aldi expanding rapidly and Lidl planning a major push into the U.S. over the next five years. Amazon (which we also own in Value Fund and Research Fund) continues to invest significant sums into its already formidable fulfillment network, with an eye toward daily–even hourly–delivery. The combined Dollar Tree is unlikely to be entirely immune to competitive encroachment, but our working thesis is that the company’s combination of convenience and low average ticket are underappreciated competitive weapons in serving the low- to middle-income U.S. consumer. In short, we continue to see Dollar Tree as one of the ‘disruptors,’ with an attractive runway of store growth and self-help opportunities at Family Dollar. We believe Dollar Tree’s stock provides long-term investors with a healthy margin of safety in the low $70s. Our base case estimate of intrinsic value falls between $100 and $105 per share.Included above is a reference to the term “margin of safety”. This term refers to purchasing securities at a price that is less than our estimate of intrinsic value. A potential “margin of safety” may limit downside risk and optimize the potential for growth.As of March 31, 2017: Dollar Tree, Inc. represented 1.6% and 2.0% of the Value and Research Funds’ net assets, respectively. Dollar General Corp. represented 1.1% of the Research Fund’s net assets. Amazon.com, Inc. represented 1.2% and 2.3% of the Value and Research Funds’ net assets, respectively.
