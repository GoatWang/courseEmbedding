What is the Vortex Water Revitalizer? The Three most Important Benefits of the Vortex Water Revitalizer
1) Your water becomes instantly absorbed by your body without the need for your body to "digest" it first and then it tastes great too and feels even better.
2) The VWR increases the amount of dissolved oxygen in your water towards its natural level.
3) The VWR eliminates and prevents slimy bacteria build-up.
The instant absorption of revitalized water into your body gives you new energy and improves the digestive system resulting in better elimination of bodily waste. Revitalized water efficiently transports nutrients to the body's cells and transports waste products and toxins out of the cells. Test has shown the amount of dissolved oxygen in e.g. well water was increased by up to 25%. The Vortex Water Revitalizer naturally softens the water, eliminating or minimizing mineral and rust deposits in coffee makers, dishwashers, cookware and plumbing.It can even clean out existing mineral deposits (caused by hard water) in your pipes over time. Revitalized water does not slosh in your stomach! The Vortex Water Revitalizer improves the taste and smell of your tap water. Even the taste and smell of chlorine disappears quickly depending upon the amount. You can also store your revitalized water for many months, which is good if you are sailing or on holiday in your mobile home. It stays fresh, clear and tastes great.
Below you can see the internal design of the Whole House Standard Vortex Water Revitalizer 3/4' diameter Copper. All of our models are using the same beautiful principles of vortex induced implosion.
We cut the pipe in order to show you the inside. All models has this design internally. This is how the life forming energetic process of vortex induced implosion is facilitated by the Vortex Water Revitalizer!
Click too see photos of all the models in our Shop Sections for Whole House Models ~ Apartment Models ~ Models for Filters ~ Commercial Models.



The Vortex Water Revitalizer is based upon an evolutionary concept in Water Treatment. It performs far beyond what any filtration system, distiller or reverse osmosis system will ever do for you. It processes all your water in a direct way, leading it into a double helix DNA type cycloid, curved spiral flow-form, which creates a powerful vortex induced implosion in the water. The Vortex Water Revitalizer uses Mother Nature's proven methods of generating energy within the water via the process of vortex induced implosion. Implosion is part of Mother Nature's unique life forming energetic process. It is the opposite of the explosive principle, which we all know to cause heat, destruction, death and disease.
By using the power of vortex induced implosion via flow dynamics, the Vortex Water Revitalizer transforms the water and restores its innate powers. The Vortex Water Revitalizer provides you with high quality water full of vitality. None of the filter/distillation systems or even bottled water can offer anything like it. It is also known as 'Living Water' and is the basis of all life in our world. Because revitalized water from the Vortex Water Revitalizer is so easily absorbed by the body, it feels as if it disappears while drinking.
The natural movements of water are being simulated in the Vortex Water Revitalizer. This allows denatured, lifeless tap water to be brought back to its natural state and be instilled with its natural, life supporting properties. By putting water through its natural flow dynamics, water’s self-cleaning, antibacterial properties are restored, it is brought to a natural pH balance, and it is naturally softened.



Background Story of World Living Water Systems and our main mentor in ‘Spirit’, Viktor Schauberger
The designer of the Vortex Water Revitalizer models, Mikael Lund CEO of World Living Water Systems, was foremost inspired by Viktor Schauberger (30 June 1885 – 25 September 1958), an Austrian forester/forest warden, naturalist, inventor and philosopher, who wrote more than 60.000 pages in German about water, forestry, agriculture, energy production, infra-structure, social structure and socio- economics as well as future global weather changes, droughts, flooding and the general decline of the quality of life in the so-called civilized world!
“THIS CIVILIZATION IS THE WORK OF MAN, WHO, HIGH-HANDEDLY AND IGNORANT OF THE TRUE WORKINGS OF NATURE, HAS CREATED A WORLD WITHOUT MEANING OR FOUNDATION, WHICH NOW THREATENS TO DESTROY HIM, FOR THROUGH HIS BEHAVIOUR AND HIS ACTIVITIES, HE, WHO SHOULD BE HER MASTER, HAS DISTURBED NATURE'S INHERENT UNITY."
~ Viktor Schauberger~
