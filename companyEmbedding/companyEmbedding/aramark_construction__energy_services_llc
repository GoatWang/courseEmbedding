Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Louisiana:













Does Aramark Construction & Energy Services, Llc carry a valid contracting license?



In Louisiana, all residential new construction of single family homes requires a contractor to be licensed as a residential building contractor. Home Improvement Contractors need to have a certificate (not a full license) to perform any home improvement contracting services over $7,500 but below $75,000.











How important is contractor licensing in Louisiana?



Louisiana requires contractors to pass a business and law exam. Continuing education is mandatory for all contractors before renewing their license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Aramark Construction & Energy Services, Llc



Louisiana requires contractors to maintain general liability insurance, and active workers' compensation policies. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liability insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Aramark Construction & Energy Services, Llc



Louisiana does not require homeowners to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners in Louisiana can file complaints with the State Licensing Board For Contractors by filling out a Consumer Complaint form. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Louisiana, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.

We work closely with our clients to develop preliminary engineering in order to accurately estimate capital cost and select primary equipment. Our detailed design engineering services include full plant design, facility integration and utility interconnection while being mindful of life cycle costs and long term value.














Equipment Procurement
Our ability to source surplus and refurbished pre-owned equipment provides our clients lower capital cost options than typical equipment providers.
