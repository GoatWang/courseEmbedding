The Salvation Army launches new Urban Mission Center with “Alan Talks”












 ST. LOUIS, MO (September 2, 2014) – The Salvation Army invites St. Louis residents to engage in a conversation about missional leadership and how the movement is transforming urban communities around the world on Sept. 5 from 7-9 p.m. at the Temple Corps Community Center, 2740 Arsenal St.
Canadian author and pastor Alan Roxburgh of The Missional Network will explore the concept of missional leadership as it pertains to urban communities, highlighting The Salvation Army’s new Urban Mission Center located in the Benton Park West neighborhood.
“Being a missional leader within the church is a new concept,” said Urban Mission Center Director Sara Johnson. “It basically means instead of placing focus on bringing people into the physical walls of your church, you’re going out into the community, serving your community, getting to know your neighbors, and making an impact that way. It’s a hands-on neighborhood transformation in the context of Christiam community; not just transforming the neighborhood, but its residents as well. The Salvation Army will be putting this into practice with the new Urban Mission Center.”
“Alan Talks” is a free event and open to anyone interested in learning more about ministering in their community. There will be plenty of open disucssion, the opportunity to ask questions, and open conversation about what is working and not working in urban St. Louis communities. The Urban Mission Center plans to host similar monthly meetings and will welcome additional guest speakers.
“We all have similar goals in our neighborhoods but we often work on them independently,” Johnson said. “If we come together from our respective churches and neighborhoods and work together, it presents the opportunity to get more accomplished and institute real change.”
To register and for more information, visit www.urbanmissioncenter.com.
About The Salvation Army:
The Salvation Army is an international organization that has been faithfully serving St. Louis since 1958. For more than 130 years, St. Louis residents with no place to go have turned to The Salvation Army for compassion, strength, and encouragement. The Salvation Army serves community members 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year through dozens of different programs and services that are designed to help people attain, or regain, self-sufficiency. For more information, go to www.stlsalvationarmy.org.
