Harvest Partners, LP and Varsity Healthcare Partners have recapitalized Dallas-based EyeCare Services Partners Holdings LLC, an ophthalmologic services company. No financial terms were disclosed. Jefferies LLC served as financial adviser to Varsity Healthcare Partners with Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP providing legal counsel.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Harvest Partners, LP (“Harvest”), a New York-based private equity firm, and Varsity Healthcare Partners (“VHP”), a healthcare-focused private equity firm, announced today that they have completed a recapitalization of EyeCare Services Partners Holdings LLC (“ESP” or “The Company”). Harvest has acquired Varsity’s majority ownership interest in the Company. The company’s management team, led by CEO Michael Fricke and other doctor shareholders, will continue to lead ESP, and will retain a significant stake in the Company. Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Based in Dallas, Texas, ESP is the nation’s largest vertically integrated ophthalmologic services company. ESP’s affiliated ophthalmologists and optometrists serve communities in California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, and Maryland. Since its founding in May 2014, ESP has affiliated with over 20 practices.
Mr. Fricke said, “ESP has had an outstanding partnership with the Varsity team, resulting in tremendous growth in our managerial organization and clinical footprint. I am excited now to work with Harvest as we look to attract the best physicians and continue to expand our network.” 





David Alpern, Partner at Varsity, commented, “Varsity has had a strong working relationship with ESP’s executive and clinical leadership over the past three years, beginning with the initial recapitalization of the Katzen Eye Group and having scaled now to 46 practice locations and seven ambulatory surgery centers across five states. We are deeply grateful to ESP’s management and clinical partners, who are truly responsible for the success of this investment.”
“Given the Company’s success, Michael Fricke and Varsity could have elected to partner with many private equity firms,” said Jay Wilkins, Senior Managing Director at Harvest Partners. “We are both delighted and honored that they chose Harvest for ESP’s next chapter of growth. With seven previous multi-site acquisitions in four years, Harvest is quite experienced in platform growth strategy, and we look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with Michael and his team to support the Company’s consolidation goals.”
Paige Daly, Managing Director at Harvest Partners, added, “ESP is exactly what we look for in a partner company. It is an undisputed leader in a burgeoning business model where there are few sizeable players. There is a clear path for growth as an aging population will require more and better services in eye and vision care.”
This sale represents the second exit for Varsity Healthcare Partners I, VHP’s initial 2014 investment vehicle.
Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Varsity Healthcare Partners and Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP provided legal counsel.

				Varsity Healthcare Partners and Harvest Partners Announce Recapitalization of EyeCare Services Partners			





					ARTICLE BY: INVISION Staff 
						24 May 2017		













Harvest acquired Varsity’s majority ownership interest in the company.

(Press Release) NEW YORK — Harvest Partners LP, a New York-based private equity firm, and Varsity Healthcare Partners, a healthcare-focused private equity firm, announced that they have completed a recapitalization of EyeCare Services Partners Holdings LLC.
Harvest has acquired Varsity’s majority ownership interest in the company. The company’s management team, led by CEO Michael Fricke and other doctor shareholders, will continue to lead ESP and will retain a significant stake in the company.
Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Based in Dallas, TX, ESP is the nation’s largest vertically integrated ophthalmologic services company. ESP’s affiliated ophthalmologists and optometrists serve communities in California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois and Maryland. Since its founding in May 2014, ESP has affiliated with over 20 practices.
Fricke said, “ESP has had an outstanding partnership with the Varsity team, resulting in tremendous growth in our managerial organization and clinical footprint. I am excited now to work with Harvest as we look to attract the best physicians and continue to expand our network.”
David Alpern, partner at Varsity, said, “Varsity has had a strong working relationship with ESP’s executive and clinical leadership over the past three years, beginning with the initial recapitalization of the Katzen Eye Group and having scaled now to 46 practice locations and seven ambulatory surgery centers across five states. We are deeply grateful to ESP’s management and clinical partners, who are truly responsible for the success of this investment.”
“Given the company’s success, Michael Fricke and Varsity could have elected to partner with many private equity firms,” said Jay Wilkins, senior managing director at Harvest Partners. “We are both delighted and honored that they chose Harvest for ESP’s next chapter of growth. With seven previous multi-site acquisitions in four years, Harvest is quite experienced in platform growth strategy, and we look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with Michael and his team to support the company’s consolidation goals.”
Paige Daly, managing director at Harvest Partners, added, “ESP is exactly what we look for in a partner company. It is an undisputed leader in a burgeoning business model where there are few sizeable players. There is a clear path for growth as an aging population will require more and better services in eye and vision care.”
This sale represents the second exit for Varsity Healthcare Partners I, VHP’s initial 2014 investment vehicle.
Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Varsity Healthcare Partners and Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP provided legal counsel.
