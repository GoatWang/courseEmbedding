AT BIOPTIX BIOSENSORS ARE ALL WE DO.
With more than 30 years combined expertise in the field of SPR, the BiOptix team is totally focused on your success and research productivity with an affordable alternative to traditional SPR instruments.
Customer-Focused Approach

Rapid response to technical requests
Protocol development and assay troubleshooting assistance
24 hour call back response time for instrument service

 
POWERFUL COMBINATION: SPR + INTERFEROMETRY
The BiOptix 404pi™ combines the power of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) with interferometry creating a unique and precise detection method called Enhanced SPR. We offer an affordable and powerful solution for drug discovery scientists that require label-free, real time detection of biomolecular interactions.

Precise measurement of kinetic rate constants, affinity constants and active concentration analysis
Intuitive, user-friendly instrument control software
Reveals information on kinetics, dissociation and stability of molecular interactions that conventional endpoint analysis doesn’t deliver

 
THE BIOPTIX 404PI IS THE IDEAL TOOL FOR BOTH SCREENING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIBODIES, PROTEINS, SMALL MOLECULES, FRAGMENTS AND BIOSIMILARS.
 
IMMUNOGENICITY SCREENING
The induction of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in patients is a major concern in the development of biological therapeutics. Detecting and quantifying ADAs is of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry because any immune response against a therapeutic can affect the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and efficacy of the drug.
The FDA strongly recommends the implementation of immunogenicity assays that detect, quantitate and characterize ADAs. Using biosensors to detect ADA is important because they can detect low affinity anti-drug antibodies (ADA) that ELISA or MSD (Meso Scale Discovery) assays may miss.






ROBUST FLUIDICS DESIGN AND DETECTION CAPABILITIES IN COMPLEX SOLUTIONS

Reliable Microfluidics Cartridge

Supports the use of high concentrations of human serum
No clogging – handles complex mixtures
Increased uptime – no replacement needed


Rapid Screening & Detection

Screens 130 samples in 14 hours
4×1 mode screens 4x faster
Detects weakly binding ADA in initial immune response
Easily determines subclasses and isotypes of antibodies
Allows for quantitative measurements of antibody dissociation rates








BIOSIMILAR DEVELOPMENT
According to the FDA Guidance on Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015), “Rigorous structural and functional comparisons that show minimal or no difference between the proposed product and the reference product will strengthen the scientific justification for a selective and targeted approach to animal and/or clinical testing to support a demonstration of biosimilarity… in vitro assays may include biological assays, binding assays and enzyme kinetics”.
The 404pi will help you demonstrate:

Similar binding kinetics to the original biologic product
Equivalent binding affinity to FcɣR and FcRn
Equivalent stoichiometry of binding
The amount of active material
Equal or lower immunogenicity






Confirmatory Immunogenicity Screen











FRAGMENT-BASED SCREENING
A significant trend in small molecule drug discovery is the growth in fragment-based screening. Many pharmaceutical and biotech companies need to cover more “chemical space” to develop new drugs and find that fragment-based screening is an excellent tool. SPR is one of the top techniques for screening fragment libraries that typically range in size from 100 Da to 300 Da.
The BiOptix 404pi:

Accurately and reliably measures binding of low MW compounds (down to 95 Da)
Screens up to 330 fragments/day

 
EXPERIMENTAL FLEXIBILITY
With two injection modes, the 404pi allows for flexibility in experimental design. 4×1 mode, where four samples can be injected simultaneously over four flow cells, enables 4x the throughput of serial flow cell biosensors. 2×2 mode is used for generating high quality, double referenced data for kinetic analysis.
 
ACTIVE CONCENTRATION ANALYSIS
The BiOptix 404pi can give the concentration of active protein rather than total protein obtained by absorbance.

Important during protein production and assay development
Can be quicker and easier than ELISA






Unique flow cell architecture of the BiOptix 404pi










Concentration analysis
Regeneration screening
Immunogenicity screening











Kinetic analysis
2 independent interactions
Decreased assay development time

404pi Surface Plasmon Resonance Instrument | BiOptix

















































































BiOptix
Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance Technologies























404pi





SPR Without Compromises
When purchasing laboratory instruments you usually have to choose between cost and some measure of quality. The 404pi Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance System exists to break that norm. It offers scientists that require label-free, real-time detection of biomolecular interactions an extremely high sensitivity, low noise instrument at a price point that is hundreds of thousands of dollars less than systems with equivalent performance. The 404pi concurrently offers industry-leading reliability, easy to use software for experimental design and instrument control, and greater experimental flexibility.

















Unrivalled Performance per Dollar
With sensitivity down to 100 Da, an extremely low noise profile, and an affordable price, no other SPR instrument comes close to giving you as much performance per dollar as the 404pi. You can finally get industry-leading SPR performance without the exorbitant price tag.






Built for Reliability
Most SPR flow cells are prone to clogging and require regular replacement – often twice per year. These kinds of flow cells are not covered under warranty and cost many thousands of dollars to replace. The 404pi’s fluidics cartridge is designed to prevent blockages and can be readily unclogged if necessary. We’re so confident that our fluidics cartridges will live a long and fruitful life, we warranty them for two years.
Your 404pi will not only have a lower operating cost than other SPR systems, but you’ll have less downtime as well. You can even run more viscous and complex solutions, such as human serum, without fear of clogging.





Features of the BiOptix 404pi include:

Phase-based SPR for high sensitivity
4 injector / 4 flow cell design for increased throughput, allowing for multiplexed kinetic measurements
Increased uptime – unique fluidic system – no annual replacement required
Standard & custom surface chemistries
Advanced fluidic system for fast kinetic measurements
In-line degassing
Supplied with industry standard Scrubber 2 software
Cost effective and simple to operate






Biological Applications:

Protein-small molecule interactions
Protein-protein interactions
Antibody-antigen interactions
Kinetics & affinities
Affinity maturation
Epitope binning
Nucleic acid-protein interactions
Biomolecule concentration measurements
Immunogenicity screening






Enhanced Throughput & Flexibility
The BiOptix 404pi utilizes a four needle autosampler and four parallel flow cells. This allows operation in a mode that provides four times the throughput of an ordinary SPR instrument, while maintaining the sensitivity that users demand. The 404pi can also be operated in a high resolution mode for more detailed analysis of molecular interactions.





Making SPR Easier than Ever
The 404pi is easier to use than any other SPR system, especially for users who are not already experts in SPR. Our software for instrument control and experimental design has a simple, intuitive, drag & drop interface. The 404pi’s software can be used while the instrument is in operation, allowing one user to design an experiment while another is running an experiment. Less user maintenance is required because of our ultra-reliable flow cell design.
SPR is all we do, so every member of our support team is a dedicated SPR expert. We’re happy to help with instrument operation, assay development, and data analysis! We know that obtaining a complete understanding of your scientific objective is important. We try to make it simple, too.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Bioptix, Inc. (Nasdaq:    BIOP) ("Bioptix" or the "Company"), announced that its board of directors has appointed Michael M. Beeghley as chief executive officer effective as of April 6, 2017. Mr. Beeghley succeeds Steve Lundy, who resigned as of April 6, 2017 from his role as president and chief executive officer, and member of the board of directors. Mr. Beeghley will continue in his role as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Lundy's resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company.








Michael Beeghley, incoming Chief Executive Officer of Bioptix, stated, "I want to recognize and thank Steve Lundy for all his efforts over the years." Mr. Beeghley continued, "Bioptix continues to advance on strategic objectives to increase value for its shareholders. This is evidenced by recently announced activities and transactions. We will continue to focus on advancing these initiatives."      
About Bioptix
The Company operates in two separate business segments. As exclusive licensee of the University of Washington in St. Louis ("UW") the Company focuses on animal healthcare and owns important intellectual property rights related to veterinary products and has granted a license relating to single chain reproductive hormone technology for use in no-human mammals which is under active development by the licensee (bovine rFSH). The Company is also a diagnostic and testing company which had been involved in developing blood-based testing for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis until a negative response from the FDA in 2014. Since 2016 with the acquisition of Bioptix Diagnostics, Inc. the Company has been seeking commercialization of Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance ("eSPR") instruments designed to increase the flexibility and reliability of SPR for a broad range of applications. The Company is reviewing possible strategic alternatives for acquisitions. Relative to its diagnostic and instrument business, the Company is exploring alternatives including possible sale, and has adopted a workforce reduction plan after suspending further development of the eSPR technology.

Company Overview
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, BiOptix Diagnostics, Inc. (“BDI”), which we acquired in September 2016, we have developed a proprietary Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions.  We acquired a Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) platform which seeks to combine high sensitivity with microarray detection capability to allow researchers to understand whether their target molecules have functionality against the disease targeted. SPR is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chip’s gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event. This change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules, kinetic rates and affinity constants.
BDI is a life science tools company that provides an affordable solution for drug discovery scientists who require label-free, real-time detection of bio-molecular interactions.  BDI manufactures, sells and services instruments and consumables to pharmaceutical researchers allowing them to develop new drugs faster than by using older technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or “ELISA”. BDI was originally established with technology developed in conjunction with Dr. John L. “Jan” Hall, Adjoint Professor, JILA (University of Colorado), who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2005 for his work on laser-based precision spectroscopy and the optical frequency comb technique. SPR is the core of the BDI products and intellectual property.  Dr. Hall, in conjunction with the scientists at BDI, created a common path interferometer that was commercialized to become the 404pi instrument.
Effective January 14, 2017, we adopted a plan to exit this acquired business and commenced a significant reduction in the workforce. The decision to adopt this plan was made following an evaluation by the Company’s Board of Directors in January 2017, of the estimated results of operations projected during the near to mid-term period for BDI, including consideration of product development required and updated sales forecasts, and estimated additional cash resources required.  We are reviewing possible strategic alternatives relative to the business to maximize shareholder value. Our continuing evaluation following adoption of the plan, estimates that we will incur charges to operations in early 2017 of approximately, $2.7 million, consisting of 1) write-down of tangible and intangible assets estimated at approximately $2.2 million, and 2) wind-down, severance and transaction expenses estimated at approximately $500,000.
Following the recent decision to exit the BDI business, we have begun evaluating potential strategic alternatives. We expect, in the near term, to establish the primary criteria we will consider as we evaluate our next steps and strategic path forward with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders. Additionally, we will focus on attempting to locate an acquirer or partner for the BDI operations as well as continuing to attempt to locate an interested party for the appendicitis assets.
We also hold an exclusive license agreement with Washington University (“WU”) in St. Louis which granted us an exclusive license and right to sublicense its technology for veterinary products worldwide, subject to certain exceptions.  In July 2012, we granted Ceva Sante Animale S.A. (“Ceva”) an exclusive royalty-bearing license to our intellectual property and other assets, relating to recombinant single chain reproductive hormone technology for use in non-human mammals.  This license includes a sublicense of the technology licensed to us by WU.  Ceva continues to advance development of the bovine rFSH product and cumulative cash payments received to date by us from Ceva have been approximately $2 million.
