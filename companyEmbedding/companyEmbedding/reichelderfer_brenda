Chevron's UK Offshore Rosebank Project Update

Chevron Corporation announce that its U.K. subsidiary has entered front-end engineering and design (FEED) on the Rosebank oil and gas project in the West of Shetland region. The Chevron-operated Rosebank project is located approximately 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Shetland Islands, in water depths of approximately 3,700 feet (1,100 meters). The project will include a floating production, storage and offloading vessel, production and water injection wells, subsea facilities, and a gas export pipeline. “Rosebank is an important project for Chevron and the West of Shetland region, which holds a significant portion of the U.K.’s undeveloped oil and gas resources,” said Brenda Dulaney, managing director, Chevron Upstream Europe.



Britain Seeks Tenant for BAE's Portsmouth Shipyard


Britain has appointed agents to find a tenant for the country's historic Portsmouth dockyard, which is due to be vacated by BAE Systems by the end of the year as the defence contractor shuts its shipbuilding activities in the city. BAE's announcement in November last year, which will affect 940 jobs, signalled the potential end of more than 500 years of shipbuilding in Portsmouth on England's south coast. The company plans to consolidate operations at its yards in Glasgow, Scotland. 



China Charges State-owned Shipyard Ex-head with Taking Bribes


The former chairman of Chinese state-run shipyard Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding has been charged with taking bribes, prosecutors said on Friday, the latest official to be swept up in President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption crackdown. The Supreme People's Procuratorate said in a notice on its website that Gu Tiquan, former board chairman of the Shanghai-based shipyard, would be prosecuted. It did not give details. Hudong-Zhonghua is a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corp, one of the largest shipbuilding conglomerates in the country. 



Cosco Bulk Shipping Losses Down in 2014

China Cosco said losses in its main dry bulk shipping business fell sharply in 2014 and its container shipping gross profit grew amid a still subdued global shipping market.

The comments were made by the firm's chief financial officer, Tang Runjiang, at its results briefing in Beijing on Friday.

Cosco Chairman Ma Zehua said the company was cooperating with state rival China Shipping in areas such as ports and domestic container shipping and said he had no information on how the firm might be affected by Beijing's plans to push forward a new round of industrial consolidation.

China Cosco posted a 54 percent rise in full-year profit on Thursday, helped by government subsidies which amounted to 1.74 billion yuan.

China to Strengthen Dangerous Goods Oversight

China's port authorities will strengthen supervision of dangerous goods shipments following devastating explosions at Tianjin port last week, the Ministry of Transport said on Wednesday. Port authorities from provinces including Zhejiang, Liaoning and Guangdong have asked shipping firms involved in relevant activities to conduct self-inspections to check safety standards, and pledged to crack down on any illegal activities, according to a report posted on the ministry's website. Over a hundred people have been killed by the blasts at a warehouse which stored hazardous chemicals at Tianjin Port. The Chinese owner of the warehouse did not a license to handle hazardous goods until two months before the disaster, according to its government-registered company records.



China Names 9 Shipyards for 'Favorable' Treatment

China has added nine shipyards to its "white list" of firms deemed worth of favourable policy support, as it attempts to tackle overcapacity that has weighed on the global shipping market. In September, it published a list of 51 yards which it later cut to 50. These yards, which it says are judged to comply with requirements such as ship emissions, are expected to get favourable policy support, such as bank credit and export tax rebates. The nine include subsidiaries of state-backed firms China State Shipbuilding Corporation, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and Aviation Industry Corporation of China , according to the list put up on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's website on Wednesday.

COSCO Secures Finance Pledge from CDB

COSCO Shipping Corporation said policy lender China Development Bank has pledged to provide it with 180 billion yuan ($26 billion) in financing in the years through 2021 to support the Chinese shipping giant's business development. Cosco Shipping said in a statement on its website late on Wednesday that the financing would be provided through various financial products. It did not provide details of how the financing would be used, but said the agreement was to serve China's "One Belt, One Road" strategy and efforts to deepen state-owned enterprise reform. Formed through the merger of China's two largest shipping companies in February, COSCO Shipping owns the world's fourth-largest container shipping fleet by capacity, run by its flagship listed unit, China COSCO Holdings .



COSCO, Vale Ink 27-year Iron Ore Transport Pact


China COSCO Shipping Corporation and Vale have signed a 27-year-long agreement that will see the Chinese shipping giant carry 16 million tonnes of iron ore per year for the Brazilian miner.

"The signing of the agreement marks the commencement of a new chapter of the cooperation between the two companies," it said. China COSCO Shipping Corporation was… 



China Cosco Shipping to Maintain Alliances until Expiry


China Cosco Shipping plans to retain its current container alliances until they expire, after which it plans to sign a new deal, it said on Monday. The group's spokesman, Yu Zenggang, did not say when the current alliance agreements were due to expire. China COSCO , a unit of COSCO, is part of the CKYHE alliance with Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Yang Ming Marine Transport, Hanjin Shipping and Evergreen Marine, while China Shipping Container Lines , a unit of China Shipping Group, CMA CGM CMACG.UL and United Arab Shipping Co make up the Ocean Three alliance. 



China Investigating Former Ningbo Port Chairman

China is investigating the former chairman of Ningbo Port Group, manager of one of the world's busiest ports, the country's top graft-busting body said, naming the latest target of an anti-corruption drive ordered by President Xi Jinping. Xu Huajiang, who resigned from the firm last month, is being investigated on "suspicion of serious violations of the law", according to a brief statement by China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on its website on Monday. In China, "serious violations of the law" usually connotes graft. The CCDI did not provide additional details. Ningbo Port is the world's sixth busiest based on 2013 container throughput volume, according to the World Shipping Council.



China: Asian Box Shipping Lines Cut Fees


Asian shipping lines including Japan's Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha and China Shipping Container Lines have voluntarily lowered shipping surcharges, the country's top economic planner said on Monday. The statement by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) comes after China's cabinet last month said it was probing shipping firms over allegations that they have been levying arbitrary and excessive charges. The NDRC said Korea's Hanjin Shipping and Hyundai Merchant Marine as well as Taiwan's Evergreen Marine… 



COSCO, China Shipping Merger Will Creat New Firm

China Ocean Shipping Group Co (COSCO) and China Shipping Group Co will become a new entity after merging, led by the latter's current chairman, China's state-owned assets regulator said on Monday. The former rivals said in December they would merge through a series of asset swaps, creating units focused on distinct business areas such as container shipping and vessel leasing. Together, COSCO and China Shipping control 488 billion yuan ($74.7 billion) worth of assets, Barclays analysts estimated. After the merger, the resulting, newly established company will be chaired by Xu Lirong, the State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission said on its official microblog. The merger comes as the government moves to consolidate state-owned industries.



COSCO Says Merger Key to Riding Out Unprecedented Downturn

The scale of the current shipping industry downturn is unprecedented and a merger is key to riding out the tough period, the chairman of new shipping giant, China Cosco Shipping Corporation (COSCOCS), said on Thursday.
 
Xu Lirong was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event to launch COSCOCS, formed by the merger of former domestic rivals China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and China Shipping Group.
 
With its proposed headquarters in Shanghai, the group will be one of the world's largest shipowners, controlling one of the largest fleets of containers ships, dry bulk ships and oil tankers.
