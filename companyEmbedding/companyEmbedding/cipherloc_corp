We Make Encryption Faster, Stronger, and Scalable
Our technology overcomes the many challenges associated with the deployment of encryption technology











Dramatically Enhances Security
CipherLoc’s unique technology is designed to provide an ironclad layer of protection that vastly strengthens existing encryption algorithms which already have some known weaknesses and which will be irreparably compromised when quantum computing becomes mainstream in the near-future.
Overview








We Make Encryption Processing Faster
Encryption is slow.  This is one reason why encryption is rationed on an “as-needed, where-needed” basis rather than ubiquitously deployed everywhere.  CipherLoc’s innovative approach makes encryption processing go much faster than commonly thought possible.
Overview








Scalable, Future-Proof Technology
Companies face an unwinnable and costly race as they are forced to continually increase security strength to stay ahead of hackers seeking to compromise their data. In contrast, our solutions are designed to seamlessly and quickly become even stronger as needed.
