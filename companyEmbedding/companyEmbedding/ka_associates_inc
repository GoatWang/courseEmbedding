Welcome
K.C.
Fields and Associates, Inc. is a promotional products marketing company
representing a group of quality manufacturers selling exclusively to
distributors of promotional products and advertising specialties in the
Mid Atlantic area of the United States.  This territory includes
Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
District of Columbia.
K.C. Fields
started this business in 1982 and takes pride in the fact that his
company has always represented nothing but the very best quality
manufacturers in each of their product categories.  Rather than
represent a large quantity of manufacturers, we prefer to focus our
attention on providing the best service to a few exceptional
suppliers.  By representing a limited amount of manufacturers, it
ensures each one of them receives the exposure they deserve in
educating and servicing their customers.
We
feel that we represent the finest suppliers in our industry. 
However, more important are our distributors.  We appreciate their
support in presenting and promoting our products.  We sincerely
enjoy helping new distributors and invite them to contact us to learn
more about becoming successful promoting the suppliers we represent. As
a result, we have developed many personal friendships with our
customers.
Michael
Fields joined the
company in 2006 in an effort to further extend our supplier
representation in our territory.  In 2015, Doug Yount also joined
our sales team, bringing in over 20+ years of industry experience and
providing us with an opportunity to expand our territory.  Both
Michael and Doug  provide us with depth in our outside sales team
that allows us to connect with as many quality distributors in our
territory as possible.
Lastly, all
distributors have our word that any business we discuss together will
be strictly confidential.  This is one of the many reasons our
company has been successful in building long lasting and yet profitable
relationships.
Thank you for
visiting our site! We are just a phone call or email away from helping
you make the most of your business. 
Have a great day!

Overview
RHEED Analysis
Stress



Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is the most widely used technology for depositing materials as a thin film onto a host substrate.  From metals, to semiconductor materials, to the most complicated optical film stacks, PVD is the most common deposition method. PVD is used in the manufacture of a wide range of goods, including semiconductor devices, aluminized PET film for balloons and snack bags, optical coatings and filters, coated cutting tools for metalworking and wear resistance, and highly reflective films for decorative displays.
PVD tools have also been developed for the fabrication of extremely thin films, i.e. films only nanometers in thickness. PVD deposition tools can deposit monolayers of virtually any material, including materials with melting points up to 3500 °C. There are variants of the PVD process whereby the method for generating the physical vapor is different, but all processes take place in a vacuum chamber of some type. PVD, like other deposition processes, benefits from in situ process monitoring.
The PVD coating method involves a purely physical process. The three most common processes are 1) plasma sputtering 2) pulsed laser deposition 3) e-beam evaporation. The film materials are transferred via various methods from some starting ‘target’ with subsequent condensation onto the host substrate.




PVD Products PLD system with kSA 400 analytical RHEED tool. www.pvdproducts.com
RHEED analysis is a proven technique for PVD applications utilized in R&D and full production facilities worldwide. Being able to analyze the surface structure and morphology via electron diffraction on a phosphor RHEED screen with the kSA 400 provides real-time film growth information.  Growth rate, surface structure and texture, and lattice spacing/strain are easily determined using the kSA 400 system.

Uncontrolled and unevaluated stress in thin films can cause serious problems with device performance and production yield. Being able to measure the stress in real-time during the growth process provides insight into the stress mechanisms and allows for optimization or minimization of the film stress. This leads to improved device quality.
The kSA MOS is proven to provide this insight and feedback in a wide range of PVD and sputtering applications in both R&D and full production facilities. It has the ability to measure and provide feedback for curvature, stress, reflectivity and growth rate to improve production processes and increase profitability.

Overview
Film Thickness and Growth Rate

Curvature and Stress




Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), sometimes called Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE), is a much higher throughput technique compared with MBE, and as such is the production deposition tool of choice for most compound semiconductor devices such as High Brightness LED’s (HBLED). Worldwide, there are several research-level MOCVD tool manufacturers, including Structured Materials, Taiyo Nippon-Sanso, Valence Process Equipment, Samco  and others. However, at the production level, there are two companies that dominate sales and have over 90 percent of the collective market share: Veeco Turbodisc and Aixtron.
MOCVD relies on the gas phase transfer of the materials to be deposited on the substrate. The deposition ultimately occurs via a chemical reaction at the substrate surface and typically results in high quality, epitaxial thin-film deposition. Because MOCVD utilizes heated gas flow and surface chemical reaction, substrate temperatures for typical device growth are higher than MBE and in the 500-1500 degrees Celcius range. In addition, the sample can be rotated at speeds as high as 1500 RPM to promote higher uniformity and film quality. Furthermore, optical access is typically limited to less than 10mm, and the optical path distance is typically short (e.g. 250mm or less). In addition, MOCVD deposition occurs at pressures close to atmospheric pressure, which precludes in situ metrology that utilize electron beams or x-rays. For these reasons, in situ optical metrology probes for MOCVD are typically compact in size. The kSA ICE metrology tool is small, compact, and easy to use. This tool offers in situ direct substrate temperature, wafer carrier temperature, film thickness, thin-film stress/wafer curvature, and surface roughness measurement in real-time.




Film thickness, reflectance and growth rate can all be measured in real-time for process control. Using the kSA ICE reflectivity module, you can have the measurements you need for improved process control, quality and efficiency. Each layer can be triggered via an external trigger signal, or can be time-based.




Temperature plays a key role in the MOCVD process. Controlling it in real-time will provide you with the improved quality and efficiency you need. Temperature can be measured with both the kSA ICE emissivity corrected pyrometry temperature module and the band edge module. kSA Scanning Pyro creates high resolution full temperature maps of Veeco K465i and EPIK700 wafer carriers and wafers.  These maps are greatly enhancing the ability to perform process optimization.




Real-time substrate curvature and film stress measured with the kSA ICE curvature module helps you monitor the stress induced during every step of the growth process and gives important insight into its dynamic behavior. This information enables you to better control both the wanted and unwanted stress in thin film to achieve the desired optoelectronic and mechanical properties.

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy – k-Space Awarded $1.2M SBIR Phase II from the U.S. DOE
We are pleased to announce that we received a $1.2M Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The purpose is to develop an “Advanced, High-Sensitivity, Multi-Species, In Situ Film Growth Monitor Utilizing Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy”. Phase I of the project was successfully completed by k-Space in November, 2015. Under Phase I, a prototype Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) instrument was developed and tested on a sputter deposition system at Argonne National Laboratory. The instrument to be commercialized will provide real-time atomic flux measurements to enable high-accuracy film growth control during the deposition of a broad variety of thin-film materials.

A Practical Guide to kSA MOS
Do you wonder how other people are measuring stress or what research and development applications are making use of the kSA MOS technology? Professor Jason Nicholas, a kSA customer at Michigan Statue University, has written a practical guide to kSA MOS. This guide describes the use kSA MOS for measuring film stress in dense film/dense substrate bilayers and porous film/dense substrate bilayers in a furnace.
Find the complete article here: J.D. Nicholas, Practical considerations for reliable stress and oxygen surface exchange coefficients from bilayer curvature relaxation measurements, Extreme Mechanics Letters (2016)

k-Space Teaches Future Scientists the Importance of Calculus
k-Space hosted the local Dexter High School AP calculus students for its annual “Calculus is Great” field trip. Four k-Spacers showed the students how calculus is utilized in our measurement tools. Examples included finding the band edge position in diffuse reflectance spectra, and determining film thickness from analyzing spectral interference fringes. Thank goodness (and Isaac Newton) for calculus!
