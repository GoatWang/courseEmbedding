History[edit]
Mountain Bell[edit]
Denver Telephone Dispatch Company[edit]
Recent Harvard graduates Frederick O. Vaille, and Henry R. Walcott, went to Denver and met a saloonkeeper, Sam Morgan, and together secured 161 customers, enough to warrant a return to Boston to secure a new telephone franchise from the American Bell Telephone Company.
When the franchise was secured, wires were strung, boys were hired as operators, a switchboard was installed and the Denver Telephone Dispatch Company opened for business on February 24, 1879. The Denver exchange was the seventeenth in the nation, opening just nine days after the Minneapolis exchange. Denver's Rocky Mountain News reported that "The Telephone Company are adding new subscribers to the system every day."[citation needed]
Building the Colorado Telephone Company[edit]
Soon after the Denver Dispatch Company began operations, the Western Union-owned Colorado Edison Telephone Company began competitive operations. Western Union also began a phone company in Leadville.
The Edison Company with its powerful transmitter was able to offer service to nearby towns of Golden, Georgetown, Central City, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo.
The competitive battle raged as the Dispatch Company acquired better transmitters and added Golden, Black Hawk, Georgetown and Central City to their calling area. When the American Bell Company won their patent infringement suit with Western Union, the Bell companies absorbed the Western Union companies. In Denver, competition for local service was absent from the market until 1997.
In 1880, Vaille sold two of his four franchise contracts back to American Bell, who sold them to Horace Tabor in Leadville. In January 1881, Vaille joined a group of Denver business leaders to form the Colorado Telephone Company. Denver Dispatch faded into history when Vaille sold his remaining two Bell contracts to the Colorado Telephone Company. Henry Wolcott was the president of Colorado Telephone, while Vaille stayed on as general manager for three years.
Meanwhile, the Colorado Telephone Company began to grow, as "boomer linemen" strung wire to ranches and farm towns in the flat lands, and to mines and mining towns in the mountains, and along Colorado's front range. Colorado Telephone purchased the Leadville company in 1888.
Rocky Mountain Bell[edit]
The Denver Dispatch Company was less than two years old when the Rocky Mountain Telephone Company began in Salt Lake City, Utah with less than 100 subscribers. With the financial backing of American Bell, The Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Company replaced Rocky Mountain Telephone in 1883. Rocky Mountain Bell immediately began an aggressive campaign to buy nearly every small telephone company in the region, and their operating territory soon covered nearly all of Utah, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.
A combination of overspending, careless management, and the logistical difficulties of covering an extremely large, sparsely populated territory would eventually put Rocky Mountain Bell in financial trouble.[vague]
Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph[edit]

These business practices stopped in 1911 when Colorado Telephone, Tri-State Telephone, and Rocky Mountain Bell merged to form The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company. Vaille was well aware of Rocky Mountain Bell's problems and he insisted that Colorado Telephone Company managers take over the majority of management positions in the former Rocky Mountain Bell Company territory. Vaille served as a Mountain States director until his death in 1920.
A number of Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph buildings survive and are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[2]

MST&T commonly did business as Mountain States Telephone until 1969, when the new Bell System logo came into use and the company name was colloquially referred to as Mountain Bell. The company provided telephone services in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Southern Idaho, Wyoming, and the El Paso, Texas vicinity. Additionally, MST&T acquired controlling interest in the Malheur Home Telephone Company in Oregon, better known as Malheur Bell. MST&T operated Malheur Bell as a wholly owned independent subsidiary, an arrangement that continued until 2009.
Mountain Bell's operations in El Paso, Texas were sold to Southwestern Bell in 1982.[3]
Prior to 1984, AT&T held a stake of 88.6% in Mountain Bell.
Usage of the Mountain Bell name has recently been reactivated by Unical Enterprises, who began producing telephones under the Mountain Bell name in 2006. Additionally, the MountainBell.com domain is still active and rolls over to the CenturyLink webpage.
From 1929 to 1984 the Mountain Bell headquarters was located at 931 14th Street in Denver, Colorado. As part of a company wide real estate savings effort, areas of the building interior was remodeled in 2009 and 2010, along with the adjoining 930 building to accommodate employees vacating leased space in the Qwest headquarters building at 1801 California St.
Northwestern Bell[edit]

Northwestern Bell Telephone Company served the states just north of the Southwestern Bell area, including: Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska.
Northwestern Bell was formerly the Iowa Telephone Company, which changed its name to Northwestern Bell in 1920. It then absorbed the operations of companies such as the Northwestern Telephone Exchange, the Tri-State Telephone Company, Dakota Central Telephone Company, and the Nebraska Telephone Company.
The Northwestern Bell headquarters was located at 1314 (DOTM) Douglas Street in Omaha, Nebraska. It remained incorporated in Iowa, however.
Pacific Northwest Bell[edit]
Main article: Pacific Northwest Bell




Pacific Northwest Bell logo, 1969–1983


Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company provided telephone services in the states of Oregon, Washington, and northern Idaho.
Pacific Northwest Bell was created on July 1, 1961, when the Bell telephone operations in northern Idaho, Oregon, and Washington state were split off from Pacific Telephone & Telegraph.
Prior to 1984, AT&T held 89.3% in Pacific Northwest Bell.
Pacific Northwest Bell's headquarters are at 1600 7th Avenue (also known as 1600 Bell Plaza), in Seattle, Washington.
Post-Breakup[edit]
Main article: US West
In 1984, the Bell System was broken into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies. U S WEST, Inc. became a holding company for Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell, and Pacific Northwest Bell.
U S WEST Communications[edit]




U S WEST Communications logo, 1988–2000


In 1988, U S WEST became the first Baby Bell to have its different Bell Operating Companies carry on business under a single name. U S WEST Communications became a "d/b/a" name for Mountain Bell as well as Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell; however, the three companies remained legally separate. The three companies also began using the U S WEST Communications logo, which continued to include the Bell symbol.
Bell Operating Companies merge[edit]
On January 1, 1991, U S WEST merged its three operating companies. As part of the deal, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Bell were folded into Mountain Bell[4][5] Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph, the surviving company, changed its name to U S WEST Communications, Inc. on January 2, 1991.
U S WEST Communications was the first local telephone company to offer Caller ID service in 1991, nearly four years before any other local telco could do so. They were the first US telco to upgrade their PSTN to electronic switching before 1990 and they were the first to offer residential and business ISDN and later, DSL services to their customers by 1997.
U S WEST, since 1984, had been selling telephone equipment under the Northwestern Bell name. In 1992, U S WEST granted Unical Enterprises, who had been producing phones under the "La Phone" brand, the right to become the exclusive licensee to produce telephones under the Northwestern Bell name, which are still produced under the BELL Phones by Northwestern Bell Phones brand.[citation needed]
Sell-off of rural areas[edit]
In 1993, U S WEST began selling off unprofitable rural telephone lines throughout its 14-state region.[6] It retained its telephone directory operations in the areas it sold.
In 1993, Pacific Telecom agreed to purchase 45 exchanges in Colorado serving 50,000 customers. The sale closed in 1994 and the lines were added to Eagle Telecommunications. In 1995, it sold several exchanges in Fremont County, Idaho to Fremont Telcom (which was acquired by FairPoint in the 2000s). The same year, Pacific Telecom acquired more access lines in Oregon and Washington. In 1996 and 1997, several U S WEST Communications exchanges in South Dakota were sold to Golden West Telecommunications. In 1996, Golden West acquired exchanges in Winner, Murdo, Burke, Bonesteel, Marion and Reliance; in 1997, it acquired lines in Clearfield, Gregory, Lesterville, and Witten. The sale included 8,500 access lines. The lines acquired were then added to Golden West's subsidiary Vivian Telephone Company.[7]
In 1999, U S WEST announced plans to sell 530,000 access lines in largely rural areas to the independent company Citizens Communications for $1.65 billion.[8] The sale would not have included U S WEST Dex directories in those territories. The transaction remained incompleted before 2000.
Acquisition by Qwest[edit]
In 2000, Qwest Communications International acquired U S WEST in a hostile takeover. At the time, U S WEST was trying to acquire Global Crossing, and resisted Qwest's takeover. Qwest was a much smaller company in terms of employees and market capitalization when it obtained control of the Regional Bell Operating Company. Because U S WEST's stock was trading at very high prices during the dot-com bubble, Qwest was able to purchase the larger firm, and the Bell Operating Company was renamed Qwest Corporation.[9]
In 2001, Qwest, which acquired U S WEST in 2000, terminated the sale of rural telephone lines agreed upon in 1999 because Citizens refused to complete the transaction.[10]
On December 14, 2009, Qwest Corporation absorbed the operations of its long-time subsidiary Malheur Bell.[11]
Acquisition by CenturyLink[edit]
On April 1, 2011, CenturyLink completed its acquisition of Qwest. At that point, Qwest Corporation became a subsidiary of CenturyLink and began doing business as CenturyLink QC effective August 8, 2011. The merger represents a reunion of exchanges acquired by Pacific Telecom in the 1990s that had been separated from U S WEST Communications.
Since acquisition by CenturyLink, Qwest Corporation has issued bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the CTQ and CTW tickers.
Qwest Corporation is one of two of the original Bell Operating Companies to be owned by a company not founded in 1983 as a Baby Bell. The other is Frontier West Virginia.
Headquarters[edit]
CenturyLink QC is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana. It maintains offices in major cities throughout the United States.

Qwest Communications International, Inc. was a large United States telecommunications carrier. Qwest provided local service in 14 western and midwestern U.S. states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock transaction.[2] The merger closed on April 1, 2011. Qwest began doing business as CenturyLink in August 2011.[3]
Qwest provided voice, Internet backbone data services, and digital television in some areas. It operated in three segments: Wireline Services, Wireless Services, and Other Services. The Wireline Services segment provided local voice, long distance voice, and data and Internet (DSL) services to consumers, businesses, and wholesale customers, as well as access services to wholesale customers. The Wireless Services segment was achieved by a partnership with Verizon Wireless. Qwest also partnered with DirecTV to provide digital television service to its customers. In Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Omaha, Qwest offered Qwest Choice TV (later also known as Qwest Digital Television), an IPTV service over DSL. This service was retired in October 2008 (after being no longer available to new customers in May 2008), leaving DirecTV as the only TV service Qwest provided. Qwest Choice TV customers were moved to DirecTV. The Other Services segment primarily involved the sublease of real estate assets, such as space in office buildings, warehouses, and other properties.
Qwest Communications also provided long-distance services and broadband data, as well as voice and video communications globally. The company sold its products and services to small businesses, governmental entities, and public and private educational institutions through various channels, including direct-sales marketing, telemarketing, arrangements with third-party agents, company’s Web site, and partnership relations. As of September 13, 2005, Qwest had 98 retail stores in 14 states. Qwest Communications was headquartered in Denver, Colorado at 1801 California Street, in the second tallest building in Denver at 53 stories. The majority of Qwest occupational or non-management employees were represented by two labor unions; the Communications Workers of America and in Montana, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Qwest also had software development centers in Bangalore and Noida (New Delhi), India called Qwest Software Services.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Founded in 1996 by Philip Anschutz, Qwest began in an unconventional way. Anschutz, who owned the Southern Pacific Railroad at the time, established the subsidiary Southern Pacific Telecommunications Company and began installing the first[where?][citation needed] all-digital, fiber-optic infrastructure along his railroad lines and connecting them into central junctions in strategic locations to serve businesses with high-speed data and T1 services. In 1997, the Southern Pacific Railroad was merged into the Union Pacific, in which Qwest gained access to UP's railroad lines to lay fiber-optic cable for its telecom network. At that time Anschutz had a contract with MCI to lay nationwide fiber for them along the railway lines; he took advantage of this situation and laid his own fiber along with that of MCI. In 1995, SP Telecom moved from San Francisco to Denver after acquiring Dallas-based Qwest Communications Corp., a digital microwave system owner, taking over its name and facilities. The Qwest headquarters were at 555 17th Street.
Qwest Communications grew aggressively, acquiring internet service provider SuperNet in 1997, followed by the acquisition of LCI, a low cost long distance carrier (located in Dublin, Ohio and McLean, Virginia) in 1998, and followed again by the acquisition of Icon CMT, a web hosting provider, also in 1998. This launched Qwest as not only a provider of high speed data to the niche market of corporate customers, but also a quick-growing residential and business long distance customer base that it quickly merged into its data service.
Qwest partnered with the Dutch national telecom operator KPN to create the pan-European data communications and hosting company KPNQwest. KPNQwest was formed in November 1998 and went on to launch an Initial Public Offering on the Nasdaq and Amsterdam stock Exchanges in November 1999. KPNQwest collapsed in bankruptcy in 2002.
US West acquisition[edit]




USWEST Corporate Logo, 1984–2000


Qwest merged with "Baby Bell" US West on June 30, 2000 through an apparent hostile takeover. Philip Anschutz owned 17.5% of the resulting company. Unlike prior merger transactions between the Baby Bells, in which the acquired entities survived as subsidiaries of SBC Communications and Bell Atlantic, US WEST ceased to exist when it was immediately absorbed into Qwest with all subsidiaries of US WEST becoming directly owned by Qwest.
As a condition of the merger, Qwest was required to sell off its long distance operations in the 14-state boundary in which it provided local telephone services. They were eventually sold to Touch America. In 2003, Qwest acquired Touch America from 360networks after Touch America filed for bankruptcy. The acquisition ended ongoing disputes between the two companies in which Touch America alleged Qwest continued to illegally sell long distance services within the former U S WEST region.[4]
Directory operations sale[edit]
In 2002, Qwest agreed to sell its directory operations, QwestDex, to private equity firms The Carlyle Group and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe for $7 billion. The sale allowed Qwest to generate cash to fend off a bankruptcy filing to which it may have had to resort due to significant amounts of debt it had incurred since the collapse of the dot-com bubble.[5] The resulting company was named Dex Media, when the sale was completed in 2004.
Alliances[edit]
Qwest Communications partnered with other major communications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, to form Movearoo.com.[6] Created on July 9, 2008, the website is a program designed to help customers in the process of moving find home service providers available in their area.[7]
Problems[edit]
Customer complaints and consumer issues[edit]
One of the historically significant mass complaints regarding Qwest involved allegations that the then-long-distance-only company switched local telephone service customers over to Qwest's long-distance service without their permission, an illegal practice known as slamming. In July 2000, Qwest paid a $1.5 million fine to the Federal Communications Commission to resolve slamming complaints. In April 2001, they paid a $350,000 fine to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection after the state cited them for deceptive advertising and slamming practices.[8] The company's settlements included a requirement that all of its sales employees sign a pledge stating that slamming was barred and a condition for dismissal from Qwest employment.
Accounting and insider trading irregularities[edit]
The company was also involved in accounting scandals, and was fined $250 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to be split into two $125 million payments due to the poor state of Qwest's current financial health. Among the transactions in question were a series of deals from 1999 to 2001 with Enron's broadband division which may have helped Enron conceal losses. In 2005, former Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Joseph Nacchio, former President and chief operating officer (COO) Afshin Mohebbi and seven other former Qwest employees were accused of fraud in a civil lawsuit filed by the SEC. Separately, Nacchio was convicted of 19 counts of insider trading in Qwest stock on April 19, 2007.[9] On March 31, 2011 US Federal Judge Marcia Krieger issued a summary judgement rejecting all SEC's claims against Afshin Mohebbi and ruling in his favor.
Qwest's slogan from 1998-2002 was "Ride The Light", which was meant to portray the company as technologically advanced. In October 2002, Richard C. Notebaert, who took over as CEO in June of that year, introduced the "Spirit of Service" campaign which promotes the company as being refocused on customer satisfaction. This slogan was in use until October 2008.
In 2004, Qwest became the first Regional Bell operating company (RBOC) in the United States to offer Standalone DSL (also known as Naked DSL), i.e. DSL Internet service that does not require the customer to have local landline phone service.
Refusal of NSA surveillance requests[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that millions of telephone calling records had been handed over to the United States National Security Agency by AT&T Corp., Verizon, and BellSouth since September 11, 2001. This data has been used to create a database of all international and domestic calls. Qwest was allegedly the lone holdout, despite threats from the NSA that their refusal to cooperate may jeopardize future government contracts,[10] a decision which has earned them praise from those who oppose the NSA program.[11]
In the case of ACLU v. NSA, U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor on August 17, 2006 ruled that the government's domestic eavesdropping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately.[12] The Bush Administration filed an appeal in the case, and Judge Taylor's decision was overturned by the appeals court.
Former Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio, alleged in appeal documents that the NSA requested that Qwest participate in its wiretapping program more than six months before September 11, 2001. Nacchio recalls the meeting as occurring on February 27, 2001. Nacchio further claims that the NSA cancelled a lucrative contract with Qwest as a result of Qwest's refusal to participate in the wiretapping program.[13] Nacchio surrendered April 14, 2009 to a federal prison camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania to begin serving a six-year sentence for the insider trading conviction. The United States Supreme Court denied bail pending appeal the same day.[14][15]
A social media experiment and website covering the Qwest holdout, "Thank you Qwest dot Org"[16] built by Netherlands-based webmaster Richard Kastelein and American expatriate journalist Chris Floyd, was covered by the CNN Situation Room,[17] USA Today,[18] New York Times,[19][20] International Herald Tribune,[21] Denver Post,[22][23] News.com,[24] and the Salt Lake Tribune.[25]
Merger with CenturyLink[edit]
On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Qwest common stock transaction. CenturyLink shareholders will hold a 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while Qwest shareholders would own the remaining 49.5%. The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase as of April 21, 2010 is $22.4 billion, including the assumption of $11.8 billion of outstanding debt held by Qwest as of December 31, 2009.[26][27] Qwest has started to do business as CenturyLink from August 8, 2011.
Corporate structure[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2011)






The Qwest corporate headquarters in Denver.


Qwest Communications International, Inc. was the holding company. It is the parent company of many more entities, but those listed below were the main operating units:

Qwest Corporation was an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and since it was part of the AT&T Bell Operating System as Mountain Bell, it is also a Bell Operating Company. Qwest Corporation serves an in-region local market which consists of the 14 states in which the pre-merger U S WEST provided local telephone service. Qwest Corporation also provides administrative and operation services such as financial, human resources, IT, and legal to the Qwest family of companies—the Qwest affiliates.

Qwest Communications International, Inc. was a large United States telecommunications carrier. Qwest provided local service in 14 western and midwestern U.S. states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock transaction.[2] The merger closed on April 1, 2011. Qwest began doing business as CenturyLink in August 2011.[3]
Qwest provided voice, Internet backbone data services, and digital television in some areas. It operated in three segments: Wireline Services, Wireless Services, and Other Services. The Wireline Services segment provided local voice, long distance voice, and data and Internet (DSL) services to consumers, businesses, and wholesale customers, as well as access services to wholesale customers. The Wireless Services segment was achieved by a partnership with Verizon Wireless. Qwest also partnered with DirecTV to provide digital television service to its customers. In Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Omaha, Qwest offered Qwest Choice TV (later also known as Qwest Digital Television), an IPTV service over DSL. This service was retired in October 2008 (after being no longer available to new customers in May 2008), leaving DirecTV as the only TV service Qwest provided. Qwest Choice TV customers were moved to DirecTV. The Other Services segment primarily involved the sublease of real estate assets, such as space in office buildings, warehouses, and other properties.
Qwest Communications also provided long-distance services and broadband data, as well as voice and video communications globally. The company sold its products and services to small businesses, governmental entities, and public and private educational institutions through various channels, including direct-sales marketing, telemarketing, arrangements with third-party agents, company’s Web site, and partnership relations. As of September 13, 2005, Qwest had 98 retail stores in 14 states. Qwest Communications was headquartered in Denver, Colorado at 1801 California Street, in the second tallest building in Denver at 53 stories. The majority of Qwest occupational or non-management employees were represented by two labor unions; the Communications Workers of America and in Montana, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Qwest also had software development centers in Bangalore and Noida (New Delhi), India called Qwest Software Services.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Founded in 1996 by Philip Anschutz, Qwest began in an unconventional way. Anschutz, who owned the Southern Pacific Railroad at the time, established the subsidiary Southern Pacific Telecommunications Company and began installing the first[where?][citation needed] all-digital, fiber-optic infrastructure along his railroad lines and connecting them into central junctions in strategic locations to serve businesses with high-speed data and T1 services. In 1997, the Southern Pacific Railroad was merged into the Union Pacific, in which Qwest gained access to UP's railroad lines to lay fiber-optic cable for its telecom network. At that time Anschutz had a contract with MCI to lay nationwide fiber for them along the railway lines; he took advantage of this situation and laid his own fiber along with that of MCI. In 1995, SP Telecom moved from San Francisco to Denver after acquiring Dallas-based Qwest Communications Corp., a digital microwave system owner, taking over its name and facilities. The Qwest headquarters were at 555 17th Street.
Qwest Communications grew aggressively, acquiring internet service provider SuperNet in 1997, followed by the acquisition of LCI, a low cost long distance carrier (located in Dublin, Ohio and McLean, Virginia) in 1998, and followed again by the acquisition of Icon CMT, a web hosting provider, also in 1998. This launched Qwest as not only a provider of high speed data to the niche market of corporate customers, but also a quick-growing residential and business long distance customer base that it quickly merged into its data service.
Qwest partnered with the Dutch national telecom operator KPN to create the pan-European data communications and hosting company KPNQwest. KPNQwest was formed in November 1998 and went on to launch an Initial Public Offering on the Nasdaq and Amsterdam stock Exchanges in November 1999. KPNQwest collapsed in bankruptcy in 2002.
US West acquisition[edit]




USWEST Corporate Logo, 1984–2000


Qwest merged with "Baby Bell" US West on June 30, 2000 through an apparent hostile takeover. Philip Anschutz owned 17.5% of the resulting company. Unlike prior merger transactions between the Baby Bells, in which the acquired entities survived as subsidiaries of SBC Communications and Bell Atlantic, US WEST ceased to exist when it was immediately absorbed into Qwest with all subsidiaries of US WEST becoming directly owned by Qwest.
As a condition of the merger, Qwest was required to sell off its long distance operations in the 14-state boundary in which it provided local telephone services. They were eventually sold to Touch America. In 2003, Qwest acquired Touch America from 360networks after Touch America filed for bankruptcy. The acquisition ended ongoing disputes between the two companies in which Touch America alleged Qwest continued to illegally sell long distance services within the former U S WEST region.[4]
Directory operations sale[edit]
In 2002, Qwest agreed to sell its directory operations, QwestDex, to private equity firms The Carlyle Group and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe for $7 billion. The sale allowed Qwest to generate cash to fend off a bankruptcy filing to which it may have had to resort due to significant amounts of debt it had incurred since the collapse of the dot-com bubble.[5] The resulting company was named Dex Media, when the sale was completed in 2004.
Alliances[edit]
Qwest Communications partnered with other major communications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, to form Movearoo.com.[6] Created on July 9, 2008, the website is a program designed to help customers in the process of moving find home service providers available in their area.[7]
Problems[edit]
Customer complaints and consumer issues[edit]
One of the historically significant mass complaints regarding Qwest involved allegations that the then-long-distance-only company switched local telephone service customers over to Qwest's long-distance service without their permission, an illegal practice known as slamming. In July 2000, Qwest paid a $1.5 million fine to the Federal Communications Commission to resolve slamming complaints. In April 2001, they paid a $350,000 fine to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection after the state cited them for deceptive advertising and slamming practices.[8] The company's settlements included a requirement that all of its sales employees sign a pledge stating that slamming was barred and a condition for dismissal from Qwest employment.
Accounting and insider trading irregularities[edit]
The company was also involved in accounting scandals, and was fined $250 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to be split into two $125 million payments due to the poor state of Qwest's current financial health. Among the transactions in question were a series of deals from 1999 to 2001 with Enron's broadband division which may have helped Enron conceal losses. In 2005, former Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Joseph Nacchio, former President and chief operating officer (COO) Afshin Mohebbi and seven other former Qwest employees were accused of fraud in a civil lawsuit filed by the SEC. Separately, Nacchio was convicted of 19 counts of insider trading in Qwest stock on April 19, 2007.[9] On March 31, 2011 US Federal Judge Marcia Krieger issued a summary judgement rejecting all SEC's claims against Afshin Mohebbi and ruling in his favor.
Qwest's slogan from 1998-2002 was "Ride The Light", which was meant to portray the company as technologically advanced. In October 2002, Richard C. Notebaert, who took over as CEO in June of that year, introduced the "Spirit of Service" campaign which promotes the company as being refocused on customer satisfaction. This slogan was in use until October 2008.
In 2004, Qwest became the first Regional Bell operating company (RBOC) in the United States to offer Standalone DSL (also known as Naked DSL), i.e. DSL Internet service that does not require the customer to have local landline phone service.
Refusal of NSA surveillance requests[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that millions of telephone calling records had been handed over to the United States National Security Agency by AT&T Corp., Verizon, and BellSouth since September 11, 2001. This data has been used to create a database of all international and domestic calls. Qwest was allegedly the lone holdout, despite threats from the NSA that their refusal to cooperate may jeopardize future government contracts,[10] a decision which has earned them praise from those who oppose the NSA program.[11]
In the case of ACLU v. NSA, U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor on August 17, 2006 ruled that the government's domestic eavesdropping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately.[12] The Bush Administration filed an appeal in the case, and Judge Taylor's decision was overturned by the appeals court.
Former Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio, alleged in appeal documents that the NSA requested that Qwest participate in its wiretapping program more than six months before September 11, 2001. Nacchio recalls the meeting as occurring on February 27, 2001. Nacchio further claims that the NSA cancelled a lucrative contract with Qwest as a result of Qwest's refusal to participate in the wiretapping program.[13] Nacchio surrendered April 14, 2009 to a federal prison camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania to begin serving a six-year sentence for the insider trading conviction. The United States Supreme Court denied bail pending appeal the same day.[14][15]
A social media experiment and website covering the Qwest holdout, "Thank you Qwest dot Org"[16] built by Netherlands-based webmaster Richard Kastelein and American expatriate journalist Chris Floyd, was covered by the CNN Situation Room,[17] USA Today,[18] New York Times,[19][20] International Herald Tribune,[21] Denver Post,[22][23] News.com,[24] and the Salt Lake Tribune.[25]
Merger with CenturyLink[edit]
On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Qwest common stock transaction. CenturyLink shareholders will hold a 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while Qwest shareholders would own the remaining 49.5%. The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase as of April 21, 2010 is $22.4 billion, including the assumption of $11.8 billion of outstanding debt held by Qwest as of December 31, 2009.[26][27] Qwest has started to do business as CenturyLink from August 8, 2011.

History[edit]
Mountain Bell[edit]
Denver Telephone Dispatch Company[edit]
Recent Harvard graduates Frederick O. Vaille, and Henry R. Walcott, went to Denver and met a saloonkeeper, Sam Morgan, and together secured 161 customers, enough to warrant a return to Boston to secure a new telephone franchise from the American Bell Telephone Company.
When the franchise was secured, wires were strung, boys were hired as operators, a switchboard was installed and the Denver Telephone Dispatch Company opened for business on February 24, 1879. The Denver exchange was the seventeenth in the nation, opening just nine days after the Minneapolis exchange. Denver's Rocky Mountain News reported that "The Telephone Company are adding new subscribers to the system every day."[citation needed]
Building the Colorado Telephone Company[edit]
Soon after the Denver Dispatch Company began operations, the Western Union-owned Colorado Edison Telephone Company began competitive operations. Western Union also began a phone company in Leadville.
The Edison Company with its powerful transmitter was able to offer service to nearby towns of Golden, Georgetown, Central City, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo.
The competitive battle raged as the Dispatch Company acquired better transmitters and added Golden, Black Hawk, Georgetown and Central City to their calling area. When the American Bell Company won their patent infringement suit with Western Union, the Bell companies absorbed the Western Union companies. In Denver, competition for local service was absent from the market until 1997.
In 1880, Vaille sold two of his four franchise contracts back to American Bell, who sold them to Horace Tabor in Leadville. In January 1881, Vaille joined a group of Denver business leaders to form the Colorado Telephone Company. Denver Dispatch faded into history when Vaille sold his remaining two Bell contracts to the Colorado Telephone Company. Henry Wolcott was the president of Colorado Telephone, while Vaille stayed on as general manager for three years.
Meanwhile, the Colorado Telephone Company began to grow, as "boomer linemen" strung wire to ranches and farm towns in the flat lands, and to mines and mining towns in the mountains, and along Colorado's front range. Colorado Telephone purchased the Leadville company in 1888.
Rocky Mountain Bell[edit]
The Denver Dispatch Company was less than two years old when the Rocky Mountain Telephone Company began in Salt Lake City, Utah with less than 100 subscribers. With the financial backing of American Bell, The Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Company replaced Rocky Mountain Telephone in 1883. Rocky Mountain Bell immediately began an aggressive campaign to buy nearly every small telephone company in the region, and their operating territory soon covered nearly all of Utah, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.
A combination of overspending, careless management, and the logistical difficulties of covering an extremely large, sparsely populated territory would eventually put Rocky Mountain Bell in financial trouble.[vague]
Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph[edit]

These business practices stopped in 1911 when Colorado Telephone, Tri-State Telephone, and Rocky Mountain Bell merged to form The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company. Vaille was well aware of Rocky Mountain Bell's problems and he insisted that Colorado Telephone Company managers take over the majority of management positions in the former Rocky Mountain Bell Company territory. Vaille served as a Mountain States director until his death in 1920.
A number of Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph buildings survive and are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[2]

MST&T commonly did business as Mountain States Telephone until 1969, when the new Bell System logo came into use and the company name was colloquially referred to as Mountain Bell. The company provided telephone services in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Southern Idaho, Wyoming, and the El Paso, Texas vicinity. Additionally, MST&T acquired controlling interest in the Malheur Home Telephone Company in Oregon, better known as Malheur Bell. MST&T operated Malheur Bell as a wholly owned independent subsidiary, an arrangement that continued until 2009.
Mountain Bell's operations in El Paso, Texas were sold to Southwestern Bell in 1982.[3]
Prior to 1984, AT&T held a stake of 88.6% in Mountain Bell.
Usage of the Mountain Bell name has recently been reactivated by Unical Enterprises, who began producing telephones under the Mountain Bell name in 2006. Additionally, the MountainBell.com domain is still active and rolls over to the CenturyLink webpage.
From 1929 to 1984 the Mountain Bell headquarters was located at 931 14th Street in Denver, Colorado. As part of a company wide real estate savings effort, areas of the building interior was remodeled in 2009 and 2010, along with the adjoining 930 building to accommodate employees vacating leased space in the Qwest headquarters building at 1801 California St.
Northwestern Bell[edit]
Main article: Northwestern Bell




Northwestern Bell logo, 1969–1983


Northwestern Bell Telephone Company served the states just north of the Southwestern Bell area, including: Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska.
Northwestern Bell was formerly the Iowa Telephone Company, which changed its name to Northwestern Bell in 1920. It then absorbed the operations of companies such as the Northwestern Telephone Exchange, the Tri-State Telephone Company, Dakota Central Telephone Company, and the Nebraska Telephone Company.
The Northwestern Bell headquarters was located at 1314 (DOTM) Douglas Street in Omaha, Nebraska. It remained incorporated in Iowa, however.
Pacific Northwest Bell[edit]
Main article: Pacific Northwest Bell




Pacific Northwest Bell logo, 1969–1983


Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company provided telephone services in the states of Oregon, Washington, and northern Idaho.
Pacific Northwest Bell was created on July 1, 1961, when the Bell telephone operations in northern Idaho, Oregon, and Washington state were split off from Pacific Telephone & Telegraph.
Prior to 1984, AT&T held 89.3% in Pacific Northwest Bell.
Pacific Northwest Bell's headquarters are at 1600 7th Avenue (also known as 1600 Bell Plaza), in Seattle, Washington.
Post-Breakup[edit]
Main article: US West
In 1984, the Bell System was broken into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies. U S WEST, Inc. became a holding company for Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell, and Pacific Northwest Bell.
U S WEST Communications[edit]




U S WEST Communications logo, 1988–2000


In 1988, U S WEST became the first Baby Bell to have its different Bell Operating Companies carry on business under a single name. U S WEST Communications became a "d/b/a" name for Mountain Bell as well as Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell; however, the three companies remained legally separate. The three companies also began using the U S WEST Communications logo, which continued to include the Bell symbol.
Bell Operating Companies merge[edit]
On January 1, 1991, U S WEST merged its three operating companies. As part of the deal, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Bell were folded into Mountain Bell[4][5] Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph, the surviving company, changed its name to U S WEST Communications, Inc. on January 2, 1991.
U S WEST Communications was the first local telephone company to offer Caller ID service in 1991, nearly four years before any other local telco could do so. They were the first US telco to upgrade their PSTN to electronic switching before 1990 and they were the first to offer residential and business ISDN and later, DSL services to their customers by 1997.
U S WEST, since 1984, had been selling telephone equipment under the Northwestern Bell name. In 1992, U S WEST granted Unical Enterprises, who had been producing phones under the "La Phone" brand, the right to become the exclusive licensee to produce telephones under the Northwestern Bell name, which are still produced under the BELL Phones by Northwestern Bell Phones brand.[citation needed]
Sell-off of rural areas[edit]
In 1993, U S WEST began selling off unprofitable rural telephone lines throughout its 14-state region.[6] It retained its telephone directory operations in the areas it sold.
In 1993, Pacific Telecom agreed to purchase 45 exchanges in Colorado serving 50,000 customers. The sale closed in 1994 and the lines were added to Eagle Telecommunications. In 1995, it sold several exchanges in Fremont County, Idaho to Fremont Telcom (which was acquired by FairPoint in the 2000s). The same year, Pacific Telecom acquired more access lines in Oregon and Washington. In 1996 and 1997, several U S WEST Communications exchanges in South Dakota were sold to Golden West Telecommunications. In 1996, Golden West acquired exchanges in Winner, Murdo, Burke, Bonesteel, Marion and Reliance; in 1997, it acquired lines in Clearfield, Gregory, Lesterville, and Witten. The sale included 8,500 access lines. The lines acquired were then added to Golden West's subsidiary Vivian Telephone Company.[7]
In 1999, U S WEST announced plans to sell 530,000 access lines in largely rural areas to the independent company Citizens Communications for $1.65 billion.[8] The sale would not have included U S WEST Dex directories in those territories. The transaction remained incompleted before 2000.
Acquisition by Qwest[edit]
In 2000, Qwest Communications International acquired U S WEST in a hostile takeover. At the time, U S WEST was trying to acquire Global Crossing, and resisted Qwest's takeover. Qwest was a much smaller company in terms of employees and market capitalization when it obtained control of the Regional Bell Operating Company. Because U S WEST's stock was trading at very high prices during the dot-com bubble, Qwest was able to purchase the larger firm, and the Bell Operating Company was renamed Qwest Corporation.[9]
In 2001, Qwest, which acquired U S WEST in 2000, terminated the sale of rural telephone lines agreed upon in 1999 because Citizens refused to complete the transaction.[10]
On December 14, 2009, Qwest Corporation absorbed the operations of its long-time subsidiary Malheur Bell.[11]
Acquisition by CenturyLink[edit]
On April 1, 2011, CenturyLink completed its acquisition of Qwest. At that point, Qwest Corporation became a subsidiary of CenturyLink and began doing business as CenturyLink QC effective August 8, 2011. The merger represents a reunion of exchanges acquired by Pacific Telecom in the 1990s that had been separated from U S WEST Communications.
Since acquisition by CenturyLink, Qwest Corporation has issued bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the CTQ and CTW tickers.
Qwest Corporation is one of two of the original Bell Operating Companies to be owned by a company not founded in 1983 as a Baby Bell. The other is Frontier West Virginia.
Headquarters[edit]
CenturyLink QC is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana. It maintains offices in major cities throughout the United States.

Quest Products Corporation was incorporated in 1994 to develop and to bring forth unique and novel application of pesticides, pesticide formulations and controlled release fertilizer products with application in agriculture, turf, horticulture and aquatics.
The early stages Quest offered consulting services for marketing and product development for a number of major manufacturers. In the early 90's Quest was one of the "behind the scene pioneers" in the introduction of Phos Phite based fertilizers and fungicides in the United States. Controlled release liquid and dry fertilizers were extensively researched in many crop applications both domestically and internationally.
Quest's activities have contributed to 5 patents being submitted to the U.S. Patent Office of which 2 are currently under review.
In 2001 the pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, known as Sudden Oak Death, (SOD) was identified as the pathogen that was attacking and killing many heritage Oak, Tan Oak and Redwood trees in California. The pathogen threatened to spread to balance of the United States.
Quest invented the application method of "basal bark application" with PENTRA-BARK® surfactant. Quest also determined why and how the application worked through the plants own metabolic pathways and the mode of action within the plant that enabled the pesticide application to be effective.
Subsequent to this discovery a number of other pesticides have been tested and proven effective with PENTRA-BARK® in basal bark applications those being systemic fungicides, systemic insecticides, and plant growth regulators. This new and novel application method holds great promise to reduce pesticide exposure to the applicator, to the environment, reduce the number of pesticide applications, reduction of the total amount of pesticide applied and reduce or eliminate chemical trespass.
Quest currently has 2 patents under review at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for this new novel application method and technology.


NEW APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY

PENTRA-BARK® is a unique patent pending surfactant application for treatment of trees and plants. PENTRA-BARK® has been specifically designed for use on herbaceous woody plant surfaces with fungicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators and micro-nutrients.
PENTRA-BARK’s new technology facilitates "non-invasive treatment" of trees and woody plants with systemic pesticides/nutrients. Conventional treatment methods utilizing labor intensive drilling, injection of root flare, and high pressure deep root injection of pesticides for soil saturation is eliminated. The liability of chemical trespass with foliar application is also eliminated.

Important Information Concerning Unauthorized Changes in Your Telecommunications Company(s) and Unauthorized Charges on Your Telephone Bill. Please contact Qwest as soon as possible if you believe that your telecommunications company has been changed without proper authorization or if you believe that unauthorized charges are on your bill.
Pursuant to the rules of the Arizona Corporation Commission, a telecommunications company is prohibited from changing your service to another company without proper authorization.


A telecommunications company that has switched your telecommunications service without proper permission is required to pay all charges associated with returning you to your original telecommunications company as promptly as reasonable business practices permit, but no later than 30 business days from your request.
An unauthorized company shall absolve you of any unpaid charges that were incurred during the first 90 days of service provided by the unauthorized company, and if you incur charges for services that were provided during the first 90 days by the unauthorized company, that company shall forward the billing data to your original company, but your original company may not bill you for unauthorized service charges incurred during this first 90 days, although it may bill you for charges thereafter at its rates.
If you paid charges to an unauthorized company, that company must pay 100% of those charges to the original company, and the original company will apply that amount as a credit to your authorized charges.
If you believe that your telecommunications provider has been changed without your permission, you may contact the unauthorized company and request your service be changed back in accordance with the rules of the Arizona Corporation Commission.
You can request your local telecommunications company to put a freeze on your long-distance account to prevent unauthorized changes.

Pursuant to the rules of the Arizona Corporation Commission, a telecommunications company is prohibited from adding products and services to your account without proper authorization.


If an unauthorized charge is added to your account, the responsible telecommunications company is required to return your service to its original service provisions and cannot charge you for doing so.
A telecommunications company must provide you with a refund or credit, at your option, due to unauthorized charges. If not refunded or credited within two billing cycles, you are entitled to interest at the rate determined by the Arizona Corporation Commission.




Subscribers or customers may contact Qwest Corporation at:

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
