                    Surrounded by two beautiful rivers, the historic community of Dunnellon, Florida lies between the plush thoroughbred horse farms of Ocala, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.  With its carefully preserved Old Florida character and spirit of hospitality, its spectacular rivers, springs, vegetation and wildlife - all only 15 miles from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico - Dunnellon is the perfect gem in Florida's natural paradise.

                    Our small town of Dunnellon with its oak lined streets sits on the confluence of both the crystal clear Rainbow River known for canoeing, tubing, snorkeling and boating and the Withlacoochee River world famous for its large mouth bass. Just a short distance away is the Gulf of Mexico and salt water fishing. Dunnellon also has miles of paved biking and hiking trails that cross the Withlacoochee River with its cypress lined banks and picturesque, natural beauty. Only 90 minutes to both Orlando and Tampa and their attractions make Dunnellon a great place to live.
