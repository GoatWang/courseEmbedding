Natus Newborn Care products address the critical areas of assessment and treatment of newborns, and are designed for use by clinicians as they provide care in the critical minutes & hours after delivery and prior to discharge from the hospital. By allowing for early detection and treatment, we believe our products can improve clinical outcomes, help reduce costs, and minimize the duration of treatment, unnecessary retesting, or hospital readmission.

Natus to Acquire Grass Technologies Product Group from Astro-Med


 Download as PDF

Jan 07, 2013


    SAN CARLOS, Calif. & WEST WARWICK, R.I.--
      Natus Medical Incorporated (Nasdaq:BABY) and Astro-Med, Inc.
      (Nasdaq:ALOT) today announced that the companies have entered into a
      definitive agreement for Natus to acquire the Grass Technologies Product
      Group from Astro-Med. The Grass Technologies Product Group includes
      clinically differentiated neurodiagnostic and monitoring products,
      including a portfolio of polysomnography (PSG) and
      electroencephalography (EEG) systems for both clinical and research use
      and related accessories and proprietary electrodes.
    

      The transaction is expected to close on January 31, 2013. Natus will
      fund the approximate $18.6 million cash purchase price with existing
      cash and borrowings under its credit facility. Astro-Med reported
      revenue from the Grass segment of $18.5 million for the fiscal year
      ended January 31, 2012. Astro-Med will retain its Grass manufacturing
      facility and the companies have entered into an agreement whereby
      Astro-Med will continue to manufacture the Grass products and provide
      other transition services for a period of time, after which Natus will
      acquire any remaining inventory.
    

      “Grass Technologies has been consistently profitable and we expect Grass
      to be accretive to our earnings in our first full quarter of ownership
      and for the full year 2013,” said Jim Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer
      of Natus. “The Grass acquisition expands our presence into certain
      international markets, adds to our disposable product offerings, and
      provides Natus an entry into the research segment of the Neurodiagnostic
      market. This acquisition will continue to allow us to bring additional
      value to customers.”
    

      “After completing a strategic review of our businesses we have
      determined that it is in the best interest of our shareholders to focus
      on our fast growing Quick Label Systems and Test & Measurement business
      segments,” said Everett V. Pizzuti, Chief Executive Officer of
      Astro-Med. “We have been working on several unique opportunities in
      these two segments and as a result, we have not been able to devote the
      resources needed to continue the growth of Grass. We know that Natus,
      with its worldwide strength and focus in neurology, is an ideal place
      for Grass to flourish.”
    

      The Grass Instrument Company was founded in 1935 by Albert Grass, who
      pioneered the development and production of the first EEG machines used
      in medical applications. Approximately one third of Grass revenue is
      attributable to consumables and service, with sales from international
      markets contributing to 38% of revenue. Products used in research, which
      represented 14% of Grass revenue for the year ended January 31, 2012,
      are sold to university researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and
      hospitals.

The Company's neurology business unit represents a line of products that are used by healthcare practitioners in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system, including outpatient private practice facilities and inpatient hospital environments including diagnostic procedures and monitoring of patients during admissions, surgery, while under sedation, in post-operative care, and in intensive care units. The Company designs, manufactures and markets a full line of instruments and supplies used to help diagnose the presence of seizure disorders and epilepsy, look for causes of confusion, evaluate head injuries, tumors, infections, degenerative diseases and metabolic disturbances that affect the brain, and assist in surgical planning. These systems and instruments work by detecting, amplifying, and recording the brain's electrical impulses (EEGs), as well as other physiological signals needed to support clinical findings. Its Global Neuro-Diagnostic Services (GND) provides in-home ambulatory EEG monitoring. GND works with physicians and hospitals to provide superior care and testing services to its patients. The Company's EEG diagnostic monitoring product lines for neurology consist of signal amplifiers, workstations to capture and store synchronize video and EEG data, and software.
