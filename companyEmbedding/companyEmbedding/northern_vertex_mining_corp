"The Moss Mine Gold/Silver Project Scheduled for Production in Q4, 2017"
VANCOUVER, July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Northern Vertex Mining Corp. (TSX.V: NEE) (the "Company" or "Northern Vertex") is pleased to provide the following update on construction activities at its 100% owned Moss Mine project located near Bullhead City, Arizona. 
Kenneth Berry, President and CEO, stated: "The delivery of the Crushing Plant ahead of schedule furthers our goal of pouring gold in Q4, 2017. Under the guidance of Dr. David Stone (Project Manager), Joseph Bardswich, P.Eng (President, Golden Vertex), M3 Engineering, Golder and Associates and N.A. Degerstrom, we continue to achieve considerable progress at the Moss Gold/Silver Mine and significantly de-risk the project both technically and financially."

Advancing the Moss Mine – Construction Progress
Concrete WorkThe concrete contractor mobilized to site on June 26.  The work completed to date includes foundation preparation for the Merrill Crowe and Refinery buildings, pouring of concrete footings, and formwork/rebar for the columns.  Great Basin Industrial (GBI) is also preparing the foundation ring for the firewater tank.
Decommissioning of the Pilot Plant ("Phase I") Heap and PondsN.A. Degerstrom has made significant progress in the decommissioning of the Phase I heap and ponds.  The spent ore removal from the pilot heap measuring 122,000 tonnes is 75 percent complete and this treated, inert material is being stockpiled for use as liner bedding in the newly constructed leach pad and ponds.  The two Phase I ponds are being dismantled in advance of re-grading for the Phase II replacement ponds.
Phase II Heap and PondsThe heap leach earthworks are advancing in two areas: the west pad and the east pad.  The west pad is essentially complete with final grading, and liner bedding placement is underway.  The west pad area will be ready for lining next week.  The east pad work consists of rough grading.  The leach pad grading is expected to be complete in mid-September.
Liners InstallationAmerican Environmental Group ("AEG") is scheduled to mobilize to the Moss Project site on Monday, July 17 to commence liner installations.  The first priority will be liner installation in the west event pond, followed by the leach pad liner in the west pad area.  AEG is expected to be onsite until the end of September.
Crushing PlantThe Company has been advised that the primary jaw crusher skid package, the tertiary K500 cone crusher and screens, and the K400 cone crusher frame have been completed and are ready for delivery to the project site.  Fabrication of several other components of the crushing plant are ahead of schedule.  The last delivery of crushing plant components is due at the end of August. 
Powerline & Infrastructure Optimization ProgramThe Moss Mine is fully permitted for commercial production utilizing on-site Tier IV CAT diesel generators.  In the continuing   efforts to optimize savings and minimize the environmental impacts the Company and Stakeholders are working together to supply clean utility power to the Mine Site.  Mohave Electric Co-operative, (MEC) Bullhead City's hometown utility, has been particularly helpful. Engineering Consultant Amec Foster Wheeler has been commissioned to design a 24.9 KV powerline connecting from the MEC infrastructure on the Bullhead Parkway to the Moss Mine.  
Subsequent to a public meeting held on July 3, 2017, the Mohave County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved the granting of a license to the Company authorizing the construction and operation of a power supply line across County Rights of Way (ROW) to the Moss Mine. The City of Bullhead City has granted a ROW on Silver Creek Road within the City Limits in co-operation with adjacent property owners.
Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") ROW permit approval is also required before construction of certain portions of the powerline can begin. The company has applied for a ROW permit based on the Amec Foster Wheeler design.   The company has also applied to the BLM for a ROW permit to re-construct and widen the Moss Mine Access Road.  On July 11, 2017  Company personnel and consultants attended a National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") meeting at the Kingman Field Office with BLM Management and Resource Personnel to discuss the applications.  The BLM will assess both projects simultaneously with one EA in order to maximize efficiencies. 
Construction of the powerline will enable utility power to replace the Company's diesel generators and eliminate the emissions from burning an estimated 200,000 gallons of diesel fuel per month.  The road re-construction project will enhance safety factors for all users of the road including Company personnel and the public. 
Qualified Person:The foregoing technical information contained in this news release has also been reviewed and verified by Mr. Joseph Bardswich, P.Eng.,President, Golden Vertex Corp., and a Qualified Person ("QP") for the purpose of National Instrument 43-101 (Disclosure Standards for Mineral Projects).  Mr. Bardswich is a director of the Company.

Northern Vertex Mining Closes Funding with Greenstone Resources and Sprott Lending - Junior Mining Network











































































			Northern Vertex Mining Closes Funding with Greenstone Resources and Sprott Lending		



                        Financing                    



                        Sprott                    




VANCOUVER, July 20, 2017 /CNW/ - Northern Vertex Mining Corp. (TSX.V: NEE) (the Company") is pleased to announce the closing of the final tranche ("Tranche 2") of the US$20 million non-brokered private placement ("Greenstone Financing") with Greenstone Resources II L.P. ("Greenstone") as previously announced on May 26, 2017 and June 9, 2017. The Company has also received an additional US$5 million from Sprott Private Resource Lending (Collector), LP ("Sprott Lending") under the credit agreement dated as of November 4, 2016, for a total of US$15 million from Sprott Lending (see November 7, 2016 and June 8, 2017 news releases for further details).
Kenneth Berry, President and CEO, stated: "Our financial partnership with Greenstone Resources and Sprott Lending has enabled us to expedite construction at our 100% owned Moss Mine Gold/Silver Project in Western Arizona.  I would like to thank Greenstone and Sprott for their insights and their commitment. I would also like to thank our shareholders, our focused construction team, our host community and stakeholders in and around Bullhead City, Mohave County, Arizona. Under the guidance of Dr. David Stone (project manager), Joseph Bardswich, PEng (president, Golden Vertex), M3 Engineering, Golder and Associates, and N.A. Degerstrom, we continue to achieve considerable progress towards our goal of scheduled production in Q4, 2017".
Pursuant to the closing of Tranche 2, Greenstone purchased 23,849,230 units ("Units") of the Company at a price of Cdn$0.52 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of US$9,213,670 (Cdn$12,401,600). Each Unit consists of one common share of the Company and one-half of one non-transferable common share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a "Warrant"). Each Warrant has a term of five years and entitles Greenstone to acquire one common share of the Company at an exercise price of Cdn$0.91 for a period of two years and at a price of Cdn$1.04 for the remainder of the term of the Warrant.  This transaction received the disinterested approval of the Company's shareholders (with all shares held by Greenstone and its affiliates and associates excluded from voting) at a special meeting of the shareholders that was held on July 18, 2017.  No finders' fees or commissions were paid in connection with the Greenstone Financing. All securities issued to Greenstone on the closing of Tranche 2 are subject to a four-month hold period, expiring on November 20, 2017, pursuant to applicable securities legislation and the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the "Exchange").
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Greenstone Financing for the continued development and construction of its Moss Mine Gold/Silver Project located in Mohave County, Arizona and for general working capital and general corporate purposes.
Upon closing of Tranche 2, Greenstone, together with the 27,920,000 common shares issued upon the closing of the first tranche ("Tranche 1") of the Greenstone Financing on June 9, 2017, holds an aggregate of 51,769,230 common shares representing 30.2% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares and an increase of 14,0% from the security holding percentage prior to completion of Tranche 2. In addition, Greenstone holds an aggregate of 25,884,615 common share purchase warrants (including the 13,960,000 warrants issued to it on the closing of Tranche 1), which if such warrants are exercised in full will result in the issuance of an additional 25,884,615 common shares and will result in Greenstone holding an aggregate of approximately 39.4% of the current issued and outstanding shares on a partially diluted basis and 32.5% on a fully diluted basis.
Greenstone has advised the Company that it is acquiring the securities under the Greenstone Financing for investment purposes.  Depending on market conditions and other factors, Greenstone advises that it may from time to time acquire and/or dispose of securities of the Company or continue to hold its current position. A copy of the early warning report required to be filed by Greenstone with the applicable securities commission in connection with the transactions will be available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              A widely watched U.S. dollar gauge languished at a 13-month low Thursday, struggling to shake off the dovish interpretation among investors of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement.

Minerals Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Minerals are solid, naturally occurring chemical substances with structures that are highly organized atomically. They also have very specific physical properties, and are formed through biogeochemical processes. Though they may look like rocks to the untrained eye, minerals differ from rocks substantially in that they have only one specific chemical composition, while rocks are a mix of many kinds of minerals or mineraloids. 
	 Some of the many chemical compositions minerals can have, ordered approximately by their abundance in the Earth�s crust from highest to lowest, include the Silicate class, the Carbonate class, the Sulfate class, the Halide class, the Oxide class, the Sulfide class, the Phosphate class, the Element class, and the Organic class. Minerals are a critical commodity to many industries following their mining and processing and form a material input to chemicals manufacturing, metallurgy, building materials manufacturing, electrical grid infrastructure, electronics, glass products, vehicles, and high-technology. Rare earth minerals or rare earth elements are particularly crucial to numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
Common oxide minerals include chromite, hematite, and magnetite. Economically, minerals from the Sulfide class are arguably just as valuable as metal ores, and include chalcopyrite, or copper iron sulfide, galena, or lead sulfide, and pentlandite, or nickel iron sulfide. The Element class is home to those minerals called native metals or intermetallic elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, as well as natural alloys. The Element class is also where one could find semi-metals and non-metals, such as bismuth, graphite, and sulfur.
