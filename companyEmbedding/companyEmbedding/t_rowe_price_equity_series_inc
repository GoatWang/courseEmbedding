Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards.

With the market currently overly focused on downside risks in Australia, this is creating opportunities for long-term investors.  Market valuation multiples are below the average of the last 20 years, and we expect earnings growth to be reasonable. Given the supportive domestic monetary environment and the lack of attractive asset class alternatives, we believe it is likely that the Australian equity market will continue to generate decent returns.

Investor Class
PRFDX

Invests at least 80% in common stocks, with an emphasis on large-capitalization stocks that have a strong track record of paying dividends or that are believed to be undervalued. Broadly diversify sector exposure to minimize volatility. 
By investing in common stocks, the fund is subject to declines in stock prices. The value approach carries the risk that the market may not realize a security's value for a long time, or that a stock judged to be undervalued is actually appropriately priced.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Variable Universal Life Insurance Investment Options

A variable life insurance policy is primarily purchased to provide death benefit protection. Additionally, owning a policy requires decisions about allocating your policy cash values among the product's variable and fixed investment options. Every investment involves some level of risk for the opportunity to earn a greater return. Finding the right balance between them is critical.
With its variable life insurance products, Pacific Life offers a broad range of investment options. The variable investment options shown near the top of this chart may provide you with the potential reward of greater returns, if you are willing to take on additional risk. When evaluating these investment options, you and your financial professional* should select your investment options based on your unique investment objectives, financial circumstances, and willingness to tolerate risk.  

The investment options within each subcategory are listed alphabetically and do not illustrate a continuum of risk/reward. Generally, portfolios of fixed income securities are less aggressive than portfolios of equity securities. While fixed income portfolios tend to be less aggressive, they still carry a variety of risks, and some will have more risks than others. Before investing, you should carefully read the investment options' prospectuses and review the investment goals/objectives and risks of the investment options. Not all investment options may be available in all VUL products. Please check your product prospectus for details.

All Pacific Select Fund Portfolios are Class I unless otherwise noted below.

Every variable investment option has some degree of risk depeneding on what it invests in and what strategies it uses. While all variable investment options are subject to market risk, some investment options may be subject to greater volatility than others. The variable investment options are not FDIC insured or guaranteed. Before investing, you should carefully read the applicable fund prospectuses.

Pacific Life is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products.


You should carefully consider a variable life insurance product’s risks, charges, limitations, and expenses, as well as the risks, charges, expenses and investment goals/objectives of the underlying investment options. This and other information about Pacific Life insurance products are provided in the applicable product and underlying fund prospectuses which are available from your life insurance producer or by clicking here. Read them carefully before investing or sending money.

Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York and in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Product availability and features may vary by state. Each insurance company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues. Insurance products and their guarantees, including optional benefits and any crediting rates, are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, but they do not protect the value of the variable investment options. Look to the strength of the life insurance company with regard to such guarantees as these guarantees are not backed by the broker-dealer, insurance agency, or their affiliates from which products are purchased. Neither these entities nor their representatives make any representation or assurance regarding the claims-paying ability of the life insurance company. Variable insurance products and shares of the Pacific Select Funds are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company, and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third-party broker-dealers.
