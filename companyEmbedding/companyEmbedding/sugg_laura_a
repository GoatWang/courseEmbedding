Description


About The Author


More By Author


Editorial Reviews














Walk into any big bookstore and you are likely to find a sizeable collection of books with "Celtic" in the title. They may be in the New Age, religion, poetry, or "occult" section, and chances are they are more about popular imagination than scholarly research. Is there really such a thing as Celtic Christianity, and if there is, does it have anything to say to Christians in the twenty-first century?It is easy to see why this field is of interest to so many people. The colorful landscapes of Ireland and Scotland beckon Americans who trace their ancestry there. People hope that there is a form of Christianity in our shared past that exhibits some things we see our contemporary faith community lacking. The literature of Celtic Christianity has a rich tradition of prayers to God in everyday life, of appreciation for the natural world in all its power and beauty, of saints whose lives and actions inspire devotion, of poetry that speaks truth. But the danger is to read our desires into Celtic Christianity rather than letting it speak for itself. How can we understand Celtic Christianity on its terms and find ways to apply it to our lives? This study attempts to do just that.

I sort of think that with this post, the pictures speak louder than any words, and I’m also very unsure how I could possibly put into words just how amazing this night was for me (and hopefully others who attended).
I don’t want this post to be solely about the products even though that is what this night was all about, but I want to talk about why this was the best night of my life. I was surrounded by my family, my friends, fellow youtubers and bloggers, some who i’ve just met and others I’ve known through the joys of the internet for many years (and not had the chance to meet yet). I felt like there was so much support in that room and that everyone there was genuinely so happy for me and that was something I was so unprepared for. It was so overwhelming and I felt so happy to be with all these amazing people. I pinch myself every single day that this is my life, and that I have been so lucky to be given these amazing opportunities and to have so many friends who I feel like are standing right beside me the whole way, supporting the things I do with such genuinity. I felt so warm and fuzzy inside the entire evening and every time I caught sight of my products or my name on a giant tin bathtub or on the wall or the mirrors, I almost had to take a second glance to realise this was actually happening. In 2009, I attended my first launch event which was for Barry M, 5 years later, I had no idea I would be having my own beauty launch event with all my favourite people.
 
*PINCHES SELF WHILST WRITING THIS BLOG POST*
 
Among the many friends, bloggers, family and other youtubers who I am wholeheartedly so grateful to have in my life supporting the things I do and the path I am on, I am also eternally grateful to you reading this, the viewers and readers who have been here since 2009, or yesterday. I love you and thank you for making my dreams come true. The happiness scale right now is through the roof, so I will leave you to enjoy this montage of photos from the evening.

Sorry for the late reply. If you haven’t already made one you can go into blogger and create an account then underneath your account name when you get to your ‘dashboard’ you click on new blog.

Zoe Sugg is expanding her product collection with a new lifestyle range.
Having already launched her own beauty range, Zoe has announced her latest venture – her own range of homeware and stationery items which are currently on display in a London flat:

The new products were announced on Twitter and Snapchat using the hashtag #ZoellaApartment. In her vlog, Zoe gives a sneak peek of the new products, which range from candles and reed diffusers to pencils and pillowcases. She will also be releasing a set of Christmas-themed items such as crackers and baubles.
Many YouTubers have been tweeting their excitement and showing support for the products:

I feel like I could use a nap. I need everything here! 😍 #ZoellaApartment https://t.co/B4zRXvAk5C pic.twitter.com/jd6vvjgQeU

I need some #ZoellaApartment goodies in my house right now! Well done chummy! @Zoella <3
— Booo!ouise (@LouisePentland) September 7, 2016


You can tell @Zoella put her heart and soul in to each and every item – you deserve ALL THE GOOD THINGS pic.twitter.com/TLaBgtsxR4
— Becca 🍂 (@BeccaRoseTweets) September 7, 2016

The new Zoella Lifestyle range will be hitting Boots and Superdrug stores from 19 September. The products will also be available on Boots.com on that date, and from Superdrug.com on 21 September.
Zoe’s Christmas collection will also be available from Feel Unique and Superdrug, both online and in stores, from 26 September.
