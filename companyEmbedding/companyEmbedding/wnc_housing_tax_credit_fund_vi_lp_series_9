NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the
Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2016

 (Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

General

 

The
accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q for quarterly
reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. For
further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Partnership's annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

 

Organization

 

WNC Housing
Tax Credit Fund VI, L.P., Series 9 (the “Partnership”)
is a California Limited Partnership formed under the laws of the
State of California on July 17, 2001 and commenced operations on
August 3, 2001. The Partnership was formed to acquire limited
partnership interests in other limited partnerships ("Local Limited
Partnerships") which own multi-family housing complexes
(“Housing Complexes”) that are eligible for Federal low
income housing tax credits (“Low Income Housing Tax
Credits”). The local general partners (the “Local
General Partners”) of each Local Limited Partnership retain
responsibility for maintaining, operating and managing the Housing
Complex. Each Local Limited Partnership is governed by its
agreement of limited partnership (the “Local Limited
Partnership Agreement”).

 

The general
partner of the Partnership is WNC & Associates, Inc.
(“Associates” or the “General Partner”).
The chairman and the president of Associates own all of the
outstanding stock of Associates. The business of the Partnership is
conducted primarily through the General Partner, as the Partnership
has no employees of its own.

 

The
Partnership shall continue in full force and effect until December
31, 2062, unless terminated prior to that date, pursuant to the
partnership agreement or law.

 

The
financial statements include only activity relating to the business
of the Partnership, and do not give effect to any assets that the
partners may have outside of their interests in the Partnership, or
to any obligations, including income taxes, of the
partners.

 

The
partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to 25,000 units of
limited partnership interest (“Partnership Units”) at
$1,000 per Partnership Unit. The offering of Partnership Units
concluded in July 1994, at which time 15,325 Partnership Units
representing subscriptions in the amount of $15,316,125, net of
dealer discounts of $7,350 and volume discount of $1,525, had been
sold. The General Partner has a 0.1% interest in operating profits
and losses, taxable income and losses, cash available for
distribution from the Partnership and Low Income Housing Tax
Credits of the Partnership. The investors (the “Limited
Partners”) in the Partnership will be allocated the remaining
99.9% of these items in proportion to their respective investments.
As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, a total of 15,302
Partnership Units remain outstanding.

then be paid to the Partnership. The sale of a Housing Complex may
be subject to other restrictions and obligations. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that a Local Limited Partnership will be
able to sell its Housing Complex. Even if it does so, there can be
no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be
distributed to the Partnership. Should such distributions occur,
the Limited Partners will be entitled to receive distributions from
the proceeds remaining after payment of Partnership obligations and
funding reserves, equal to their capital contributions and their
return on investment (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). The
General Partner would then be entitled to receive proceeds equal to
its capital contributions from the remainder. Any additional sale
or refinancing proceeds will be distributed 90% to the Limited
Partners (in proportion to their respective investments) and 10% to
the General Partner.

 

Risks and
Uncertainties

 

An
investment in the Partnership and the Partnership’s
investments in Local Limited Partnerships and their Housing
Complexes are subject to risks. These risks may impact the tax
benefits of an investment in the Partnership, and the amount of
proceeds available for distribution to the Limited Partners, if
any, on liquidation of the Partnership’s investments. Some of
those risks include the following:

 

The Low
Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated.
Noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future Low
Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual
amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last
$25,000 of taxable income. The Local Limited Partnerships may be
unable to sell the Housing Complexes at a price which would result
in the Partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from
the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may be unable to
distribute any cash to its Limited Partners. Low Income Housing Tax
Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the
Partnership.

 

The
Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited
Partnerships. Such limited diversity means that the results of
operation of each single Housing Complex will have a greater impact
on the Partnership. With limited diversity, poor performance of one
Housing Complex could impair the Partnership’s ability to
satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex is subject
to mortgage indebtedness. If a Local Limited Partnership failed to
pay its mortgage, it could lose its Housing Complex in foreclosure.
If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years (the
“Compliance Period”), the loss of any remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of prior Low
Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of the Partnership’s
investment in the Housing Complex would occur. The Partnership is a
limited partner or a non-managing member of each Local Limited
Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership will have very limited
rights with respect to management of the Local Limited
Partnerships. The Partnership will rely totally on the Local
General Partners. Neither the Partnership’s investments in
Local Limited Partnerships, nor the Local Limited
Partnerships’ investments in Housing Complexes, are readily
marketable. To the extent the Housing Complexes receive government
financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or
more of the following risks: difficulties in obtaining tenants for
the Housing Complexes; difficulties in obtaining rent increases;
limitations on cash distributions; limitations on sales or
refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of
interests in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of
Local General Partners; limitations on subsidy programs; and
possible changes in applicable regulations. Uninsured casualties
could result in loss of property and Low Income Housing Tax Credits
and recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits previously taken.
The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating
economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax,
environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of
similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among
others.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

For the
Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2016

 (Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued

 

The ability
of Limited Partners to claim tax losses from the Partnership is
limited. The IRS may audit the Partnership or a Local Limited
Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items. The
amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable
to the limited partners could be reduced if the IRS were successful
in such a challenge. The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax
benefits from an investment in the Partnership. Changes in tax laws
could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the
Partnership and/or the value of the Housing Complexes.

 

The
Partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund its
operations. Associates has agreed to continue providing advances
sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital
requirements of the Partnership through November 30,
2017.

 

Anticipated
future and existing cash resources of the Partnership are not
sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the Partnership. However,
substantially all of the existing liabilities of the Partnership
are payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates. Though
the amounts payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates
are contractually currently payable, the Partnership anticipates
that the General Partner and/or its affiliates will not require the
payment of these contractual obligations until capital reserves are
in excess of the aggregate of then existing contractual obligations
and then anticipated future foreseeable obligations of the
Partnership. The Partnership would be adversely affected should the
General Partner and/or its affiliates demand current payment of the
existing contractual obligations and or suspend services for this
or any other reason.

 

No trading
market for the Partnership Units exists or is expected to develop.
Limited Partners may be unable to sell their Partnership Units
except at a discount and should consider their Partnership Units to
be a long-term investment. Individual Limited Partners will have no
recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the
majority of Limited Partners.

 

Exit
Strategy

 

The
Compliance Period for a Housing Complex is generally 15 years
following construction or rehabilitation completion. Associates was
one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in
Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The initial programs have completed
their Compliance Periods.

 

Upon the
sale of a Local Limited Partnership interest or Housing Complex
after the end of the Compliance Period, there would be no recapture
of Low Income Housing Tax Credits. A sale prior to the end of the
Compliance Period could result in recapture if certain conditions
are not met. None of the remaining Housing Complexes have completed
their 15-year Compliance Period.

 

With that
in mind, the General Partner is continuing its review of the
Housing Complexes. The review considers many factors, including
extended use requirements (such as those due to mortgage
restrictions or state compliance agreements), the condition of the
Housing Complexes, and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners
from the sale of the Housing Complexes.

 

Upon
identifying those Housing Complexes with the highest potential for
a successful sale, refinancing or re-syndication, the Partnership
expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them. The objective is
to maximize the Limited Partners’ return wherever possible
and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership as Low Income Housing
Tax Credits are no longer available. Local Limited Partnership
interests may be disposed of any time by the General Partner in its
discretion. While liquidation of the Housing Complexes continues to
be evaluated, the dissolution of the Partnership was not imminent
as of September 30, 2016.

 

As of March
31, 2016, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership
interests in Mendota I, L.P. (“Mendota”), Villas of
Palm, L.P. (“Villas of Palm”), Preservation Partners
III Limited Partnership (“Preservation”), and Calico
Terrace Limited Partnership (“Calico Terrace”). The
Compliance Period for Mendota, Preservation, and Calico Terrace
expire in 2016, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The respective
purchasers have guaranteed that the LLP will stay in compliance
with the Low Income Housing Tax Credit code, therefore there is no
risk of recapture to the investors of the Partnership.

Partnership is not under contract to be purchased as of the report
filing.

 

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Housing Complexes will
be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective
Local Limited Partnership Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will
then be paid to the partners of the Local Limited Partnership,
including the Partnership, in accordance with the terms of the
particular Local Limited Partnership Agreement. The sale of a
Housing Complex may be subject to other restrictions and
obligations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Local
Limited Partnership will be able to sell its Housing Complex. Even
if it does so, there can be no assurance that any significant
amounts of cash will be distributed to the Partnership, as the
proceeds first would be used to pay Local Limited Partnership
obligations and funding of reserves.

 

Method of
Accounting for Investments in Local Limited
Partnerships

 

The
Partnership accounts for its investments in Local Limited
Partnerships using the equity method of accounting, whereby the
Partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the
Local Limited Partnerships’ results of operations and for any
contributions made and distributions received. The Partnership
reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a Local
Limited Partnership for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
investment may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such
investment is measured by the estimated value derived by
management, generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits estimated to be allocable to the
Partnership and the estimated residual value to the Partnership. If
an investment is considered to be impaired, the Partnership reduces
the carrying value of its investment in any such Local Limited
Partnership. The accounting policies of the Local Limited
Partnerships, generally, are expected to be consistent with those
of the Partnership. Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring
the investments were capitalized as part of the investment and were
being amortized over 30 years.

 

“Equity
in losses of Local Limited Partnerships” for the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 has been recorded by the
Partnership. Management’s estimate for the three and
six-month periods is based on either actual unaudited results
reported by the Local Limited Partnerships or historical trends in
the operations of the Local Limited Partnerships. Equity in losses
of Local Limited Partnerships allocated to the Partnership is not
recognized to the extent that the investment balance would be
adjusted below zero. If the Local Limited Partnerships report net
income in future years, the Partnership will resume applying the
equity method only after its share of such net income equals the
share of net losses not recognized during the period(s) the equity
method was suspended (see Note 2).

 

In
accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of
variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it
should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a
variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and
when it should disclose information about its relationship with a
VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity
should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A
VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets,
which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary
beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If
multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party
will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance
requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a
VIE.

 (Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued

 

Based on
this guidance, the Local Limited Partnerships in which the
Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners
of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to
direct their operations. However, management does not consolidate
the Partnership's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered
to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to
direct the activities that are considered most significant to the
economic performance of these entities. The Partnership currently
records the amount of its investment in these Local Limited
Partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its
share of partnership income or losses in the statements of
operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of
these investments in its financial statements. The Partnership's
balance in investment in Local Limited Partnerships, plus the risk
of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these
investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The
Partnership's exposure to loss on these Local Limited Partnerships
is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the
underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the Local
General Partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to
the investors in the Partnership.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Each Series was formed in 2003 as a California limited partnership. Each Series will operate as a “two-tier” partnership, i.e., each Series will invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (“Local Limited Partnerships”). The Local Limited Partnerships in turn will engage in the ownership and operation of apartment complexes expected to be qualified for low income housing tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The General Partner is a California limited liability company whose sole member is WNC & Associates, Inc. (“WNC & Associates”), a California corporation. 
2. The objectives of each Series are (a) to provide current tax benefits primarily in the form of low income housing credits which investors may use to offset their Federal income tax liabilities, (b) to preserve and protect capital, and (c) to provide cash distributions from sale or refinancing transactions. 
3. On July 21, 2003, the Fund filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to which the Fund intends to offer publicly, in two series of offerings, 25,000 units of limited partnership interest (“Units”) at $1,000 per unit. The minimum investment will be five Units for most investors, although employees of the General Partner and/or its affiliates and/or investors in syndications previously sponsored by the General Partner and/or its affiliates may purchase a minimum of two Units. Purchasers of the Units will become limited partners (“Limited Partners”) of the Series offering the Units. 
4. A Series will not accept any subscriptions for Units until the requested exemptive order is granted or the Series receives an opinion of counsel that it is exempt from registration under the Act. Subscriptions for Units must be approved by the General Partner. Such approval will be conditioned upon representations as to suitability of the investment for each subscriber. The suitability standards provide, among other things, that investment in a Series is suitable only for an investor who either (a) has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles), of at least $35,000 and an annual gross income of at least $35,000, or (b) irrespective of annual income, has a net worth (exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles) of at least $75,000. Units will be sold only to investors who meet these suitability standards, or such more restrictive suitability standards as may be established by certain states for purchasers of Units within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, transfers of Units will be permitted only if the transferee meets the same suitability standards as had been imposed on the transferor Limited Partner. 
5. Although a Series' direct control over the management of each apartment complex will be limited, the Series' ownership of interests in Local Limited Partnerships will, in an economic sense, be tantamount to direct ownership of the apartment complexes themselves. A Series normally will acquire at least a 90% interest in the profits, losses, and tax credits of the Local Limited Partnerships. However, in certain cases, the Series may acquire a lesser interest in such partnerships. Each Local Limited Partnership's partnership agreement will provide that distributions of proceeds from a sale or refinancing of an apartment complex will be paid to a Series in the range of from 10% to 50%. 
6. Each Series will have certain voting rights with respect to each Local Limited Partnership. The voting rights will include the right to dismiss and replace the local general partner on the basis of performance, to approve or disapprove a sale or refinancing of the apartment complex owned by such Local Limited Partnership, to approve or disapprove the dissolution of the Local Limited Partnership, and to approve or disapprove amendments to the Local Start Printed Page 57942Limited Partnership agreement materially and adversely affecting the Series' investment. 
7. Each Series will be controlled by the General Partner, pursuant to a partnership agreement (the “Partnership Agreement”). The Limited Partners, consistent with their limited liability status, will not be entitled to participate in the control of the business of the Series. However, a majority-in-interest of the Limited Partners will have the right to amend the Partnership Agreement (subject to certain limitations), to remove any General Partner and elect a replacement, and to dissolve the Series. In addition, under the Partnership Agreement, each Limited Partner is entitled to review all books and records of the Series. 
8. Applicants state that the Partnership Agreement and prospectus of the Series contain provisions designed to ensure fair dealing by the General Partner with the Limited Partners. Applicants also state that all compensation to be paid to the General Partner and its affiliates is specified in the Partnership Agreement and prospectus. Applicants believe that the fees and other forms of compensation that will be paid to the General Partner and its affiliates are fair and on terms no less favorable to the Series than would be the case if such arrangements had been made with independent third parties. 
9. During the offering and organizational phase, WNC Capital Corporation, an affiliate of the General Partner, will receive a dealer-manager fee and a nonaccountable underwriting expense allowance in amounts equal to 2% and 1%, respectively, of capital contributions. The General Partner or an affiliate will receive a nonaccountable organizational and offering expense reimbursement in an amount equal to 3% of capital contributions. The General Partner has agreed to pay all organizational and offering expenses (excluding selling commissions, the dealer-manager fee, the nonaccountable underwriting expense allowance and the nonaccountable expense reimbursement). 
10. During the acquisition phase, each Series will pay WNC & Associates a fee equal to 7% of capital contributions for analyzing and evaluating potential investments in Local Limited Partnerships and for various other services. WNC & Associates will receive a nonaccountable acquisition expense reimbursement equal to 2% of capital contributions in consideration of which WNC & Associates will pay all acquisition expenses of each Series. Aggregate fees and expenses paid in connection with the organization of each Series, the offering of Units, and the acquisition of Local Limited Partnership interests by each Series will be limited by the Partnership Agreement and will comply with guidelines published by the North American Securities Administrators Association. These guidelines require that a specified percentage (generally 80%, but subject to reduction) of the aggregate Limited Partners' capital contributions to the Fund be committed to Local Limited Partnership interests. 
11. During the operating phase, the General Partner will receive 0.1% of any cash available for distribution, and each Series may pay certain fees and reimbursements to the General Partner or its affiliates. An asset management fee will be payable for services related to the administration of the affairs of each Series and ongoing management of each Series. Other fees may be paid in consideration of property management services provided by the General Partner or its affiliates as the management and leasing agents for some of the apartment complexes. In addition, the General Partner and its affiliates generally will be allocated 0.1% of profits and losses of each Series for tax purposes and tax credits. 
12. During the liquidation phase, and subject to certain prior payments to the Limited Partners, each Series will pay the General Partner or its affiliates a fee equal to 1% of the sales price of the apartment complexes sold in which the General Partner or its affiliates have provided a substantial amount of services. The General Partner also will receive 10% of any additional sale or refinancing proceeds. 
13. All proceeds from a Series' public offering of Units initially will be placed in an escrow account with USbank (“Escrow Agent”). Pending release of offering proceeds to the Series, the Escrow Agent will deposit escrowed funds in short-term United States Government securities, securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government, and certificates of deposit or time or demand deposits in commercial banks. Upon receipt of a prescribed minimum amount of capital contributions for a Series, funds in escrow will be released to the Series and held by it pending investment in Local Limited Partnerships. 
14. If more than one entity that the General Partner or its affiliates advises or manages may invest in a particular investment opportunity, the decision as to the entity that will be allocated the investment will be based upon such factors as the effect of the acquisition on diversification of each entity's portfolio, the estimated income tax effects of the purchase on each entity, the amount of funds of each entity available for investment, and the length of time such funds have been available for investment. Priority generally will be given to the entity having uninvested funds for the longest period of time. However, any entity that was formed to invest primarily in apartment complexes eligible for state low income housing tax credits (“state tax credits”) as well as for Federal low income housing tax credits will be given priority with respect to any investment that is eligible for state tax credits over entities which are not seeking to provide state tax credits. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Applicants believe that the Fund and its Series will not be “investment companies” under sections 3(a)(1)(A) or 3(a)(1)(C) of the Act. If the Fund and its Series are deemed to be investment companies, however, applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) and 6(e) of the Act from all provisions of the Act, except sections 37 through 53 of the Act and the rules and regulations under those sections. 
2. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Applicants believe that the Fund will not be an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(A) because the Fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes, not securities. 
3. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer's total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items). Applicants state that although the Local Limited Partnership interests may be deemed “investment securities,” they are not readily marketable, cannot be sold without severe adverse tax consequences, and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the Local Limited Partnerships. 
4. Applicants believe that the two-tier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the Commission's release concerning two-tier real estate partnerships (the Start Printed Page 57943“Release”).[1] 
           The Release states that investment companies that are two-tier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the Act pursuant to section 6(c). Section 6(c) provides that the Commission may exempt any person from any provision of the Act and any rule thereunder, if, and to the extent that, such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 6(e) permits the Commission to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the Act to comply with certain specified provisions of the Act as though the company were a registered investment company. 
5. The Release lists two conditions, designed for the protection of investors, which must be satisfied by two-tier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section 6(c). First, interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit, essentially tax-shelter, investments would not be unsuitable. Second, requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company. 
6. Applicants assert, among other things, that the suitability standards set forth in the application, the requirements for fair dealing provided by the Partnership Agreement, and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each Local Limited Partnership by various Federal, state, and local agencies provide protection to investors in Units. In addition, applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest.
