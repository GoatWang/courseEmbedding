INDEPENDENCE
TAX CREDIT PLUS L.P. II

AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30,
2010

(Unaudited)

 

 

NOTE 1
– General

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Independence Tax Credit Plus L.P. II (the
“Partnership”) and fifteen other limited partnerships
(“subsidiary partnerships”, “subsidiaries”
or “Local Partnerships”) owning leveraged apartment
complexes that are eligible for the low-income housing tax
credit.  The general partner of the Partnership is
Related Independence Associates L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the “General Partner”).  Through
the rights of the Partnership and/or an affiliate of the General
Partner, which affiliate has a contractual obligation to act on
behalf of the Partnership, to remove the general partner of the
subsidiary partnerships (each a “Local General
Partner”) and to approve certain major operating and
financial decisions, the Partnership has a controlling financial
interest in the subsidiary partnerships.

 

For
financial reporting purposes, the Partnership’s fiscal
quarter ends June 30.  All subsidiaries have fiscal
quarters ending March 31.  Accounts of the subsidiaries
have been adjusted for intercompany transactions from April 1
through June 30.  The Partnership’s fiscal quarter
ends June 30 in order to allow adequate time for the
subsidiaries’ financial statements to be prepared and
consolidated.  All intercompany accounts and transactions
with the subsidiary partnerships have been eliminated in
consolidation.

 

In
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 810, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements (“ASC 810”), loss
attributable to noncontrolling interests amounted to approximately
$5,000 and $9,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and
2009, respectively.  The Partnership’s investment
in each subsidiary is equal to the respective subsidiary’s
partners’ equity less noncontrolling interest capital, if
any.

 

Certain
information and note disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) have been omitted or
condensed.  These condensed financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended March 31, 2010.

 

The books
and records of the Partnership are maintained on the accrual basis
of accounting in accordance with GAAP.  In the opinion of
the General Partner of the Partnership, the accompanying unaudited
financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
financial position of the Partnership as of June 30, 2010, the
results of operations and its cash flows for the three months ended
June 30, 2010 and 2009.  However, the operating results
for the three months ended June 30, 2010 may not be indicative of
the results for the year.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In
February, 2010, the FASB issued under Topic 855, Subsequent Events,
ASU 2010-09, “Amendments to Certain Recognition and
Disclosure Requirements”. This ASU addresses both the
interaction of the requirements of this Topic with the SEC’s
reporting requirements and the intended breadth of the reissuance
disclosure provision related to subsequent events.  An entity
that is an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through
which subsequent events have been evaluated.   This ASU
is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15,
2010.  The adoption of this accounting standard is not
expected to have a material effect on the Partnership’s
consolidated financial statements.

 

NOTE 2
– Related Party Transactions

 

An
affiliate of the General Partner has a .01% interest as a special
limited partner in each of the subsidiary partnerships. An
affiliate of the General Partner also has a minority interest in
certain local partnerships.

(a)



The
General Partner is entitled to receive a partnership management
fee, after payment of all Partnership expenses, which together with
the annual local administrative fees will not exceed a maximum of
0.5% per annum of invested assets (as defined in the Partnership
Agreement), for administering the affairs of the Partnership.
Subject to the foregoing limitation, the partnership management fee
will be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion
based upon its review of the Partnership’s investments.
Unpaid partnership management fees for any year will be accrued
without interest and will be payable from working capital reserves
or to the extent of available funds after the Partnership has made
distributions to the limited partners of sale or refinancing
proceeds equal to their original capital contributions plus a 10%
priority return thereon (to the extent not theretofore paid out of
cash flow). Partnership management fees owed to the General Partner
amounting to approximately $6,002,000 and $5,877,000 were accrued
and unpaid as of June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively,
and are included in the line item Due to general partners and
affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets.  Current
year partnership management fees may be paid out of operating
reserves or refinancing and sales proceeds.  As such, the
General Partner cannot demand payment of the deferred fees except
as noted above.




 




(b)



The
Partnership reimburses the General Partner and its affiliates for
actual Partnership operating expenses incurred by the General
Partner and its affiliates on the Partnership’s behalf. The
amount of reimbursement from the Partnership is limited by the
provisions of the Partnership Agreement. Another affiliate of the
General Partner performs asset monitoring for the Partnership.
These services include site visits and evaluations of the
subsidiary partnerships’ performance. Expense reimbursements
and asset monitoring fees owed to the General Partner and its
affiliates amounting to approximately $477,000 were accrued and
unpaid as of June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010.  The
General Partner does not intend to demand payment of the deferred
payables beyond the Partnership’s ability to pay
them.  The Partnership anticipates that these will be
paid from working capital reserves or future sales
proceeds.




 




(c)



Independence
SLP L.P., a special limited partner of the subsidiary partnerships,
is entitled to receive a local administrative fee of up to $5,000
per year from each subsidiary partnership.  As of June
30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, the subsidiary partnerships owed
approximately $392,000 and $381,000, respectively, of these fees to
Independence SLP L.P.  These fees have been deferred in
certain cases and the Partnership anticipates that they will be
paid from working capital reserves or future sales
proceeds.




 

As of June
30, 2010, the Partnership owes $12,000 to the Special Limited
Partner for the fees it received from a Local Partnership on its
behalf.

NOTE 3
– Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 

The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments (all of which are held
for nontrading purposes) for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Investments Available-for-Sale and Cash Held in
Escrow

The
carrying amount approximates fair value.

 

Mortgage
Notes Payable

The
Partnership adopted FASB ASC 820 – “Fair Value
Measurements” for financial assets and
liabilities.  ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements.  ASC 820 applies to reported
balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair
value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the
standard does not require any new fair value measurements of
reported balances.

 

As
permitted, we chose not to elect the fair value option as
prescribed by ASC 825 – “Financial
Instruments” – Including an Amendment of ASC 320
– “Investments – Debt and Equity
Securities”, for our financial assets and liabilities
that had not been previously carried at fair
value.  Therefore, we did not elect to fair value any
additional items under ASC 825.

 

The
estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined
using available market information or other appropriate valuation
methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is
required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair
value.  Consequently, the estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid
in a current market exchange.  The following are
financial instruments for which the Partnership’s estimate of
fair value differs from the carrying amounts:

 




  



At June
30, 2010



 



At March
31, 2010

$



22,545,093



 























 

 

For the
mortgage notes, fair value is calculated using present value cash
flow models based on a discount rate.  It was determined
that the Tender Option Bond market, through which these bonds have
been securitized in the past, continued to see a dramatic slowdown
with limited liquidity and significantly reduced transaction
levels.  To assist in valuing these notes, the
Partnership held separate discussions with various third party
investment banks who are leaders in the municipal bond
business.  The discussions produced assumptions that were
based on market conditions as well as the credit quality of the
underlying property partnerships, which held the mortgage notes, to
determine what discount rates to utilize.

NOTE 4 – Sale of Properties

 

The
Partnership is in the process of developing a plan to dispose of
all of its investments.  As of June 30, 2010, the
Partnership has sold its limited partnership interests in two Local
Partnerships.  There can be no assurance as to when the
Partnership will dispose of its remaining investments or the amount
of proceeds which may be received.  However, based on the
historical operating results of the Local Partnerships and the
current economic conditions, including changes in tax laws, it is
unlikely that the proceeds from such sales received by the
Partnership will be sufficient to return to the limited partners
their original investments.  All gains and losses on
sales are included in discontinued operations.

 

On March
31, 2010, the Partnership sold its limited partnership interest in
Tasker Village Associates (“Tasker”) to an affiliate of
the Local General Partner for a sales price of
$20,000.  The Partnership did not receive any cash from
this sale after the repayment of other liabilities of
$20,000.  The sale resulted in a gain of approximately
$2,361,000, resulting from the write-off of the deficit basis in
the Local Partnership of the same amount at the date of the sale,
which was recorded during the year ended March 31,
2010.  An adjustment to the gain of approximately
$(39,000) was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2010,
resulting in an overall gain of approximately
$2,322,000.  In addition, the sale resulted in a non-cash
contribution to the Local Partnership from (i) the General Partner
of approximately $28,000 as a result of the write-off of fees owed
by the Local Partnership to an affiliate of the General Partner;
and (ii) the Local General Partners of approximately $99,000 as a
result of the write-off of fees owed by the Local Partnership to
the Local General Partner.

NOTE 6 – Commitments and Contingencies

 




a)



Going
Concern Consideration




 

At June
30, 2010, the Partnership’s liabilities exceeded assets by
$45,162,579 and for the three months ended June 30, 2010 incurred a
net loss of $751,129, including gain on sale of properties of
$39,131.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Partnership’s ability to continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2, partnership management fees of approximately
$5,877,000 will be payable out of sales or refinancing proceeds
only to the extent of available funds after payments on all other
Partnership liabilities have been made and after the Limited
Partners have received a 10% return on their capital
contributions.  As such, the General Partner cannot
demand payment of these deferred fees beyond the
Partnership’s ability to pay them.  In addition,
where the Partnership has unpaid partnership management fees
related to sold properties, such management fees are written off
and recorded as capital contributions.

 

All of the
mortgage payable balance of $50,932,403 and the accrued interest
payable balance of $23,798,669 is of a nonrecourse nature and
secured by the respective properties.  The Partnership is
currently in the process of developing a plan to dispose of all of
its investments.  Historically, the mortgage notes and
accrued interest thereon have been assumed by the buyer in
instances of sales of the Partnership’s interest or have been
paid off from sales proceeds in instances of sales of the
property.  In most instances when the Partnership’s
interest was sold and liabilities were assumed, the Partnership
recognized a gain from the sale.  The Partnership owns
the limited partner interest in all its investments, and as such
has no financial responsibility to fund operating losses incurred
by the Local Partnerships.  The maximum loss the
Partnership would incur is its net investment in the respective
Local Partnerships.  Dispositions of any investment in a
Local Partnership should not impact the future results of
operations, liquidity, or financial condition of The
Partnership.

 

The
Partnership has working capital reserves of approximately $526,000
at June 30, 2010.  Such amount is considered sufficient
to cover the Partnership’s day to day operating expenses,
excluding fees to the General Partner, for at least the next
year.  The Partnership’s operating expenses,
excluding the Local Partnerships’ expenses and related party
expenses amounted to approximately $42,000 for the three months
ended June 30, 2010.

 

Management
believes the above mitigating factors enable the Partnership to
continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

 




b)



Subsidiary
Partnerships – Going Concern




 

Mansion
Court Associates (“Mansion Court”)

Mansion
Court had a net loss of $11,581 for the three months ended March
31, 2010.  Mansion Court has sustained operating losses
over the years and has not generated sufficient cash flow from
operations to meet its obligations.  The Local General
Partner has provided funding in the past years; however there is no
obligation to do so.  The property also has experienced a
high number of vacancies due to deteriorating conditions in the
area.  As of December 31, 2009, the project had 22 out of
30 vacant units.  Vacancies continue to increase due to
declining conditions in the surrounding neighborhood, and the
expenditure of funds at this time to make improvements would not
benefit the project.  The Local General Partner is
exploring options to mitigate increased crime and deteriorating
neighborhood conditions.  These options include
assistance from local government housing agencies and could include
transfer of ownership.

 

The
Partnership’s investment in Mansion Court at June 30, 2010
and March 31, 2010 was reduced to zero as a result of prior
years’ losses and the noncontrolling interest balance was
$69,000 at each date.  Mansion Court’s net loss
after noncontrolling interest amounted to approximately $11,000 and
$24,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

 




c)



Uninsured
Cash and Cash Equivalents




 

The
Partnership maintains its cash and cash equivalents in various
banks.  The accounts at each bank are guaranteed by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000.

 




d)



Cash
Distributions




 

Cash
distributions from the Local Partnerships to the Partnership are
restricted by the provisions of the respective agreements of
limited partnership of the Local Partnerships and/or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

 




e)



Property
Management Fees




 

Property
management fees incurred by the Local Partnerships amounted to
$198,197 and $198,394 for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and
2009, respectively.  Of these fees $88,699 and $88,337
were earned by affiliates of the Local General Partners, which
include $3,736 and $3,727 of fees relating to discontinued
operations.

 




f)



Other




 

The
Partnership is subject to the risks incident to potential losses
arising from the management and ownership of improved real
estate.  The Partnership can also be affected by poor
economic conditions generally; however, no more than 39% of the
properties are located in any single state. There are also
substantial risks associated with owning properties receiving
government assistance; for example, the possibility that Congress
may not appropriate funds to enable HUD to make rental assistance
payments. HUD also restricts annual cash distributions to partners
based on operating results and a percentage of the owner’s
equity contribution. The Partnership cannot sell or substantially
liquidate its investments in subsidiary partnerships during the
period that the subsidy agreem
