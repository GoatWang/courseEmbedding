Campaign Finance and Political Polarization
When Purists Prevail
Raymond J. La Raja and Brian F. Schaffner
An illuminating perspective on the polarizing effects of campaign finance reform


		This open access edition was funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation through its Madison Initiative.






Description





Efforts to reform the U.S. campaign finance system typically focus on the corrupting influence of large contributions. Yet, as Raymond J. La Raja and Brian F. Schaffner argue, reforms aimed at cutting the flow of money into politics have unintentionally favored candidates with extreme ideological agendas and, consequently, fostered political polarization.
Drawing on data from 50 states and the U.S. Congress over 20 years, La Raja and Schaffner reveal that current rules allow wealthy ideological groups and donors to dominate the financing of political campaigns. In order to attract funding, candidates take uncompromising positions on key issues and, if elected, take their partisan views into the legislature. As a remedy, the authors propose that additional campaign money be channeled through party organizations—rather than directly to candidates—because these organizations tend to be less ideological than the activists who now provide the lion’s share of money to political candidates. Shifting campaign finance to parties would ease polarization by reducing the influence of “purist” donors with their rigid policy stances.
La Raja and Schaffner conclude the book with policy recommendations for campaign finance in the United States. They are among the few non-libertarians who argue that less regulation, particularly for political parties, may in fact improve the democratic process.
“Ray La Raja and Brian Schaffner have written an important book from a fresh research perspective that needs to be incorporated into all discussions of money in politics. From polarization to the proper role of the political parties, this book takes an extremely productive look at what is happening in the states and how that might serve as a laboratory for what works and what doesn’t in our elections.”
—Benjamin L. Ginsberg, Partner, Jones Day; former counsel to RNC, the Mitt Romney campaign, and the Bush-Cheney campaigns
“As American politics has grown more polarized, more shrill, and more deadlocked, reformers have been treating it with horse-doctors’ doses of the wrong medicine—or so Ray La Raja and Brian Schaffner argue in this deeply researched, closely argued, and urgently important book. Instead, strengthening the role of parties and political professionals could begin restoring health to the body politic. This counterintuitive and compelling book will change the way you think.”
—Jonathan Rauch, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution

“LaRaja and Schaffner's book upends conventional wisdom on money in politics. They demonstrate convincingly that our disfigured campaign funding system has led to the worst of all worlds: unlimited and unaccountable outside spending that polarizes our politics, alongside hamstrung political parties that would be in the best position to reign in extremists and create governing coalitions. The book is a must-read for anyone who cares about the mockery our campaign financing system has become.”—Nathaniel Persily, James B. McClatchy Professor of Law, Stanford Law School “It might seem paradoxical that strengthening parties could actually reduce partisan polarization. But that is exactly the provocative argument that La Raja and Schaffner make. It is an argument worth taking seriously by anyone who wants to make American politics less divisive.”—John Sides, George Washington University “I believe this book will be one of the more important contributions in the last decade to understanding the dynamics of political polarization in America today. Campaign Finance and Political Polarization is methodologically innovative and impressive in the data bases it uses to take advantage of the ‘natural’ comparative social science ‘experiment’ in the effects of campaign finance regulation on the legislative process that results from different regimes across the states.” —Rick Pildes, New York University

Praise / Awards


"[La Raja and Schaffner] meticulously analyse party factions, who donates to political campaigns and why, and they also examine data that indicate how fewer restrictions on political parties increase financial support for moderate candidates. Anyone interested in looking at an alternative to the current campaign finance system should read this research." --London School of Economics and Political Science Review of Books
"This is a very important book that will be widely discussed...It is highly readable and is backed by innovative data on state-level party polarization, the ideology of donors, and state campaign finance laws...Highly recommended." --Choice Reviews

Winner of the 2016 Virginia Gray Best Book Award from the American Political Science Association

Small Change
Money, Political Parties, and Campaign Finance Reform
Raymond J. La Raja
A rich analysis of the colorful and contentious history of campaign finance reform 





Description





Reformers lament that, with every effort to regulate the sources of campaign funding, candidates creatively circumvent the new legislation. But in fact, political fundraisers don't need to look for loopholes because, as Raymond J. La Raja proves, legislators intentionally design regulations to gain advantage over their partisan rivals. 
La Raja traces the history of the U.S. campaign finance system from the late nineteenth century through the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002. Then, using the 2004 presidential election as a case study, he compares the ways in which Democrats and Republicans adapted their national fund-raising and campaigning strategies to satisfy BCRA regulations. Drawing upon this wealth of historical and recent evidence, he concludes with recommendations for reforming campaign finance in ways that promote fair competition among candidates and guarantee their accountability to voters.
Small Change offers an engaging account of campaign finance reforms' contradictory history; it is a must-read for anyone concerned about influence of money on democratic elections.

Raymond J. La Raja is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.


Praise / Awards


"La Raja avoids reformist rhetoric and skillfully analyzes the consequences of campaign finance reform for the political parties." —Sandy Maisel, William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government, Colby College
"The most thorough and up-to-date account of the historical evolution of campaign finance regulation in the United States available." —Gary Jacobson, Professor of Political Science, University of California, San Diego
"Ray La Raja gives us a superior investigation of campaign finance regulations and how they have affected the American political parties." —Robert Mutch, Historian, Author of Campaigns, Congress, and Courts: The Making of Federal Campaign Finance Law
"Ray La Raja has launched with his new book a major reconsideration of the terms in which campaign finance regulation is understood. In place of the debate we have had for years, now stale and unproductive, he asks for a realistic appraisal of the interests served by regulation and its costs—including an original view of the competing interests of different factions even within parties. His account is particularly compelling in showing the adverse effects of the current regulatory scheme on political parties overall, and he takes the responsible course of matching his analysis to fresh policy recommendations. His book will be read widely, and it will make a difference." —Robert Bauer, Chair of the Political Law Group of Perkins Coie LLP
"Sen. Barack Obama's groundbreaking decision to reject public financing was widely criticized by good government groups and reform-minded lawmakers in both parties. However, Small Change: Money, Political Parties, and Campaign Finance Reform, predicted this would be a direct result of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law—the same law supported by most of those now blasting Obama's decision...Ultimately, La Raja favors a series of reforms that strengthen the political parties, including higher contribution limits to the national parties and allowing greater party coordinated spending. These proposals acknowledge that past reforms efforts to limit campaign money were doomed to fail and that no one should be surprised of the campaign finance system that resulted. It's an interesting book, very timely and highly recommended." —Taegen Goddard, Political Wire
"This book is a substantial contribution to the literature on campaign finance reform." —Choice

Armed with some know how, a few small touches and Walmart's Every Day Low Prices on home furnishings and decor, you can breathe new life into your living space   whether it be with fresh furniture like a bedroom set or something functional like a new bookshelf. Spaced out: Your living room life Are you rethinking your current living room? A new television is always a nice addition, but you may want a new sofa, arm chair or accent table first. When considering what furniture to buy, think about the space you have available and the look you want for the room. Possibly the most important piece of furniture in your living room will be the sofa. If you have a lot of space to work with, look for a big sofa that can accommodate your family and guests. If you don't have much space, look for something more compact, possibly even a loveseat. For additional seating (again, depending on how much space you have), you can add a loveseat, recliner or armless chair. An accent table and an ottoman can add functionality and style too. If you don't have a lot of interior design experience and you want a consistent look throughout the room, consider getting a living room furniture set. Living room sets come with different pieces to fit different spaces, so you can choose one that best serves your needs. You can also refresh the look of the room with smaller changes. Try reframing your pictures, adding some wall art or getting a new slipcover for the couch if you don't want to buy a new sofa. Decorative accent pillows are a great, inexpensive way to give your living room some personality as well. Stackable modular storage cubes are a simple design solution and they're eco-friendly. Cubes are an excellent home organizer for your modern living space. Each one is separate so you can stack them side by side or on top of each other, or you can get creative and build a pyramid or ladder design. You can also mix and match the colors or just keep it simple with a single shade. Build a better bedroom Getting a new set of bedding is a great way to give your bedroom a quick makeover, while providing the warmth and comfort you need. When picking out bedding, consider the size of your mattress, the climate and weather where you live, the material you want and whether you'd prefer a bedding set or separates. Bedding comes in the same sizes as mattresses (single, double, twin, full, queen, king and so on) so it's easy to match your sheets and blankets to your mattress size. For colder weather, choose bedding that is thicker, like a down duvet or comforter, and consider flannel-weave sheets if you tend to get cold more easily. For warmer weather, look for lighter top bedding and percale-weave or silk sheets. Cotton is the most popular material for sheets, but there are many varieties to pick from, including Pima and Egyptian cottons, both of which are extremely comfortable and luxurious. You can also choose from a variety of weaves, including percale, which is very soft, smooth and shiny. Easy kitchen solutions Your kitchen and dining area make up the heart of your home. Let's face it, with three meals per day, you spend a lot of time there eating, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meals. With kitchenware, dinnerware, kitchen furniture and more from Walmart, you can make these areas functional, welcoming spaces for the entire family. The kitchen can easily be made more inviting by adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets and walls. For finishing touches, get some color-coordinated kitchen towels or potholders, and place a new plant in the kitchen window. Keep your kitchen neat and organized with storage and organization products, including pantries, racks, cabinet and counter organizers and food storage containers. Handy products like these make it easier to find what you need when you need it, so you can prepare meals with less confusion and frustration. Complete sets of pots, pans and knives make cooking easier, whether you're prepping for your family or a crowd. And if you like to bake, it's worth stocking up on bakeware, so you always have what you need. Let there be lighting New window treatments and lighting can really pick up the atmosphere throughout your home. Choose window furnishings that add both color and style and let in the natural light from your outdoor surroundings. Then use accent lights to highlight your favorite keepsakes and add light fixtures that complement your decor.

Add your unique touch to your space with home decor itemsthere's a reason that being an interior decorator can be such a lucrative career. The ability to create unique spaces within people's homes that they love and that wows visitors is a gift. If you don t want to go the professional decorator route, you can still create a space that shows off your personal tastes and represents who you're as a person and that of your family. Walmart makes it easy to find just the right home decor items to make your home the showplace you want it to be, and we can help you do so while saving you money at the same time with our Every Day Low Prices.curtains and window treatmentsThe right curtains or window treatments really set off a room, such as a living room or bedroom. In addition to looking good, curtains and window treatments need to be functional as well, which is what may cause someone to favor one over the other. Curtains and drapes are a way to add color, style and depth to a room and can serve to showcase the windows of your home. They're available in many colors as well as materials, including linen, cotton, rayon, satin, polyester, silk and several different fabric blends. You can choose curtains and drapes that run from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of higher ceilings, or those that are just slightly larger than the window they're covering for a crisper look or if you have small children or pets at home that you don't want to play with longer curtains. When selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space, as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiency.Another common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades. Blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows, and you can adjust them depending on the time of day. Many shades are made from wood, wood composite or synthetic wood, but there are shades made from vinyl, metal and bamboo as well. Depending on the blinds, they generally rest inside the window frame, so you'll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds. Shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out, especially on hot days. These also go inside the window frame. Choose cordless shades that pull down and raise with a quick tug when you don't want dangling cords.Lighting and light fixturesLighting options include permanent fixtures such as overhead lighting, wall fixtures and ceiling fan lights. Lamps are portable lights you can place anywhere and can range from table lamps to floor lamps. Permanent ceiling fixtures that you choose depend on the style you're seeking to match. For an Old World or traditional feel, you can select chandeliers or pendant lighting. For more modern touches, dome or flush mount lighting and track lighting are good options. Chandeliers look especially good above a dining table or in an entryway or hall. Many permanent fixtures allow you to control the amount of light put out through the use of a dimmer switch you can add. Ceiling fans with lights serve a dual purpose and allow you to run one without the other or both at the same time. Ceiling fans also help the heating and cooling units in your home be more efficient, giving you added cost savings on your energy bills.Lamps are often more decorative pieces and can fall under many distinctive style schemes. Many table lamps are modern-looking pieces with lots of metal, such as brushed nickel or stainless steel. More traditional-looking table lamps are available with ceramic and wooden bases. Most table lamps have lampshades, which can add a splash of color to the room. Floor lamps can blend into the background of a room or be a showpiece that draws attention. Place one in a corner for a warm lighting effect. You can mix or match lamps for a room, and some are even available in sets.RugsIf you have hardwood or vinyl flooring, a throw rug or area rug is a functional and stylish addition to any room. Many area rugs offer unique color schemes or designs that can set off a room. You can use these rugs to cover up bare areas of your floor, including high-traffic areas, or place them under furniture, such as dining tables and coffee tables, adding some stability and protecting your floors at the same time. You can also add accent rugs and runners to areas of your floor that you'd rather see covered or places where rugs would be more comfortable on your feet and that of your family and friends.Other decor itemsArtwork and wall decor can make plain wall spaces in your home come alive with color. You can choose from canvas wall art, wall decals or framed wall art, such as paintings and sketches. You can also add family portraits or framed pictures to make your wall spaces more personal. Mirrors, both wall hanging and floor standing, can add depth to a room and make it seem larger.If your sofa, loveseat or armchairs are lacking in vitality, a few colorful throw and decor pillows can liven them up. These pillows are also functional, making an evening of TV watching more comfortable. Pillows come in many sizes, although most are square, round or rectangle, and feature a variety of color and designs, such as stripes, floral, animal and graphic prints. Choose what you love best and what brings out the decor in your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332935, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Choose the best options for your decorating needs by considering the wall space you want to fill. If your wall space is small, one piece of art will do. Larger spaces do best with a series of wall hangings or one large piece that serves as a focal point. Consider your existing decor when choosing art and wall decor. Vintage signs add appeal to a home that already has an antique flavor, for example. Sleek, minimalist art goes best with contemporary decor. Choose art and wall decor that reflects your taste and personality. If you love nature, create a garden on your walls. If you're more of a romantic, adorn your walls with red hearts and a sentimental quotation. Whether you go for canvas wall art, metal decor or vinyl wall decals, there's an abundance of pieces that speak to you at Walmart, where you'll find gorgeous artwork at Every Day Low Prices. Wall Art and Photography Invigorate your decor with new and exciting wall art and inspiring photography. From architecture and landscapes to still life displays and sports, you'll find canvas art, posters and photography in every subject you desire, framed or unframed, in sizes from less than 30 inches to over 100 inches in height and in various lengths to match. To hang wall art, let the shape of the wall help you determine the arrangement. For example, put a wall art set on a long horizontal wall, two pieces of art one over the other on a narrow vertical wall or one large piece of art between two windows on a wall. The design options are endless with wall art. Wall Art Sets Large wall spaces benefit from coordinated wall art sets. Eliminate the guesswork when it comes to coordinating color and style with art sets that do the pairings for you. Consider wall art sets that unite a space with one theme or one image that ties your room's decor together.  Floater-framed photography sets, which make the art look like it's floating in the frame, come in various configurations, sizes and numbers of pieces. Floater-framed staggered sets come in three pieces that make a statement across your wall, for example, while a floater-framed set of four pieces can create a more coordinated square pattern on your wall. Wrapped canvas sets of five pieces make it easy to hang photography printed on cotton canvas in fade-resistant inks. Sets of two oversized wall plaques of paintings, drawings and inspirational sayings hung side by side create symmetry. Metal Wall Art Turn your home into a gallery with sophisticated, rustic or whimsical metal wall art. Hang a set of three elegant wire poppies with vintage flair, dimensional wall art that makes it look like you attached vases of flowers on the wall or a contemporary radiating iron wire wall sculpture structure with multi-colored discs to add sparkle to your home. Wall Decals What better way is there to put up nail-free wall art than with decorative decals? From sports themes to wall murals and inspirational quotations to backsplash-style tiles, wall decals cover all types and sizes of wall spaces or emphasize smaller areas with a pop of color and curiosity. Today's wall decals are sophisticated enough to put in dining rooms and cute enough for nurseries, too. They look like customized wall murals or stencils, but they're much easier to remove and reposition thanks to easy peel-and-stick technology. Mirrors and Frames Mirrors are works of art, and they come in all shapes, sizes and finishes and in sets. Decorate a baby's room with a sweet heart-shaped mirror, or add a round mirror with a kitten's silhouette in a child's room. Formalize your entryway, hall or dining area with Baroque-inspired framed mirrors. Decorate your living room with rustic framed, mirrored wall panels. Frame and surround yourself with your favorite memories. There's never a need to wonder how to perfectly set your images because collage frames do the work for you with a combination of horizontal and vertical frames attached to each other. From large-size frames for collectible posters to novelty word-shaped frames, your walls will be filled with uplifting decor. Personalized Wall Art Gift someone you love with a piece of art that's personalized. When ordering personalized wall art, you have the option of choosing a variety of messages. For example, for a housewarming gift, create a personalized street sign featuring a first or last name or even the name of a street stamped on metal. Give your music lover a guitar lounge sign shaped like a guitar pick and personalized with a first name. Celebrate family with a personalized home and family blessings canvas that features your last name. The options for personalizing wall art are only as limited as your imagination.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332917, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Abstract

Skates are widely consumed across the globe, but many large species are subject to considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now have to be made under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e.g., Dipturus batis, Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature and the fact that they are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i.e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines).



Introduction
Skates (batoid elasmobranchs of the family Rajidae, but colloquially referred to as rays) are consumed across the world with recent estimates of global total catch reaching approximately 720,000 tonnes per annum (Seafish, 2013). Whilst skates are rarely specifically targeted by fisheries, they form a significant by-catch and constitute an important commercial group for human consumption. The group also contains many species that are potentially vulnerable to even low levels of harvesting due to their large size, slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002). This has famously been demonstrated in the common skate species complex (Dipturus batis), which was the first fish to become locally extinct in parts of its former range through a clear link to commercial fishing (Brander, 1981). Of the 75 rajids assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species (excluding those defined as data deficient), 19 are listed as threatened (IUCN, 2012). In response to skate declines, the European Union (EU) has now established total allowable catches (TAC) for skates in most European waters, and currently it is ‘prohibited for EU vessels to fish for, to retain on board or to land’ three species; Raja undulata, Raja alba and the D. batis-complex (CEC, 2013).
Until recently, landings of different skate species were combined under a single category, such that serious declines in one species could effectively be masked by stable trends in more abundant groups (Dulvy et al., 2000). Therefore, to more easily assess trends in abundance of individual species, a recent EU Regulation (CEC, 2013) has been introduced to ensure that landings of many skates are recorded by species and not as an aggregated group. Identification remains problematic as skates are a morphologically conservative group, making the process of distinguishing between some species difficult. Furthermore, similarly to shark finning, skates are only commercially valued for their large pectoral fins (or ‘wings’), so prior to sale their bodies are usually discarded (i.e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. Molecular genetic techniques for species identification therefore represent the only methods for distinguishing between different skates, allowing for the protection of threatened species or populations, and also the recognition of groups with different commercial values. Indeed, previous studies utilising molecular approaches for species identification of skate species have proved highly effective, often helping to uncover previously cryptic diversity (Díaz de Astarloa et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2008; Griffiths et al., 2010).
In recent years international efforts have been made to establish a standardised reference DNA barcode of life database (BOLD; www.barcodinglife.org; Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007), with the aim of generating cytochrome-c oxidase I or COI gene sequences to facilitate the identification of all animals. This includes a campaign to DNA barcode all fishes; FISH-BOL (Ward, Hanner & Hebert, 2009). In fact, specific efforts have already been made to collect validated barcode sequences for skates both within Europe (Serra-Pereira et al., 2010), and globally (Ward et al., 2008; Coulson et al., 2011; Lago, Vietites & Espineira, 2012). These reference sequences have now facilitated numerous molecular studies of species identification and mislabelling, which have helped identify high levels of substitution in many commercial products (Marko et al., 2004; Wong & Hanner, 2008; Cawthorn, Steinman & Witthuhn, 2012). Particular insights have also been gained through applications of DNA barcoding to elasmobranch products, which have demonstrated high levels of fraudulent substitutions in sales of sharks (Barbuto et al., 2010), identified endangered species in confiscated shark fins (Holmes, Steinke & Ward, 2009) and revealed the sale of endangered sawfish as “shark” fillets in markets in Brazil (Melo Palmeira et al., 2013).
Despite EU legislation regarding the correspondence of species/Latin names for landings, skates are still generally sold under the broad title of ray or skate wings (with skate wings typically originating from the larger fish). Therefore, little remains known about exactly which species are passed on to consumers. Beside the increasing number of studies reporting substantial levels of seafood mislabelling (Logan et al., 2008; Miller & Mariani, 2010), the importance of guaranteeing informed consumer choice has also been highlighted (Miller, Jessel & Mariani, 2012), which is particularly relevant to the sales of skate. Moreover, in recent years several large supermarket chains have consciously moved from stocking ‘skate’ to ‘ray’ wings, presumably reflecting a desire to sell smaller species from more sustainable sources (Waitrose, 2009). This study represents the first intensive investigation into the patterns of the sale of skate species in the North-east Atlantic, specifically the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and the United Kingdom (UK), with a particular focus on (a) whether those species that are prohibited to land within the EU appear on sale, and (b) if market variations can be detected between different retail sectors and/or regions.


Materials & Methods

Sample collection
Samples labelled as ray or skate wings were initially purchased from fishmongers or fish counters within supermarkets and takeaway ‘fish and chips’ shops from across Dublin (ROI). The retailers were also visited in two distinct periods; January–February and October–November 2010. A total of 58 wings from 10 fish mongers/counters and 9 takeaways were analysed (Table 1 and Supplemental Information). In order to provide a wider view of patterns of skate consumption, 40 additional fresh ray or skate wings were also collected between October 2012 and March 2013 from around the UK; sampling was focused in the south-west of England (i.e., counties of Devon and Cornwall), north-west England (largely in Greater Manchester and Liverpool), Glasgow (Scotland), and Cardiff (Wales). UK samples were limited to ‘fresh’ products as investigations of takeaways in the UK cities failed to identify any that sold skate. Repeat sampling from any single shop was kept to a minimum, although it was necessary in some cases to increase the sample size (but efforts were generally made to sample on different dates or from different sized wings; Supplemental Information 1). Therefore, between January 2010 and March 2013 a total of 98 wings were collected from 49 different retailers across the ROI and UK.

Molecular analysis
Tissue samples were collected following Miller, Jessel & Mariani (2012) and DNA extractions were completed according to a modified chloroform extraction procedure (Petit, Excoffier & Mayer, 1999). DNA barcoding (specifically of COI gene) was selected as the species identification tool (Hebert et al., 2003). Approximately 648 base pairs (bp) of the COI region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers designed by Ward et al. (2005): FishF2 (5′-TCGACTAATCATAAAGATATCGGCAC-3′) and FishR2 (5′-ACTTCAGGGTGACCGAAGAATCAGAA-3′). Reaction conditions following Serra-Pereira et al. (2010) were utilized for all purchased skate samples. The PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen Inc, Seoul, and Source Bioscience, Nottingham, and the results were checked by eye in BIOEDIT version 7.1.11 (Hall, 1999) for errors and ambiguous base calls. The sequences were then input into the BOLD system using the species level barcode database to identify the species of each sample and then cross-referenced using BLAST on GenBank (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, National Centre for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Maryland; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). A 98% similarity criterion was used as a threshold above which identification of unknown samples was deemed reliable (as analysis of barcode records suggests at a divergence of greater than 2% it is very likely that sequences belong to different species, Ward, 2009). Any additional matches within this 98% criterion are also reported in the Supplemental Information. However, in the case of the BOLD system, only additional matches within the Public Record Barcode database are described. This should help ensure that the primary identification is made with a comprehensive database that maximises the chance of finding a strong match, but any additional matches are only made with the more closely regulated dataset, helping to reduce issues associated with the misidentification of submitted records.


Data analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data was conducted in PRIMER-6 (Clarke & Warwick, 2001), with each retailer representing an individual data point in the ordination. The software was also used to conduct a non-parametric analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) with 999 permutations, and to calculate the contribution of variables to similarity (or similarity percentages; SIMPER). Both utilised the Bray-Curtis similarity measure during calculation. Otherwise, the program defaults were utilised.



Results & Discussion

DNA barcoding
Good quality sequences were obtained for all 98 skate samples, these varied in length between 494 and 646 bp (average length 617.9 bp). Searches on BOLD and GenBank generally produced clear matches allowing for confident assignment of species and there was good agreement between databases. In fact, all the searches yielded matches that were within 98% similarity to database records, with one exception (Supplemental Information 1). In this case a 100% match on BOLD was made, but no results within the 98% similarity criterion were located in GenBank, so the BOLD identification was utilised. Additionally, in 24 cases a second close match (also with less than 2% divergence to the unknown samples) was also identified. These additional matches originated from closely related sister taxa, but in every case the species were not distributed around the British Isles (they included: Raja maderensis that is restricted to Madeira and the Azores, Raja polystigma that is restricted to the Mediterranean, Raja straeleni and Leucoraja walacei that both have a primarily South African distribution). Therefore, the additional matches were deemed unlikely to be the true source of the samples and the species with the highest degree of similarity from the BOLD species level barcode database was upheld for the identification.
Across the entire study, six species of skate were identified in products sold for consumption (Table 2); 31 blonde rays (Raja brachyura), 28 spotted rays (Raja montagui), 19 thornback rays (Raja clavata), 14 cuckoo rays (Leucoraja naevus), five small-eyed rays (Raja microocellata) and one shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica).

Statistical support
The PCA failed to produce highly distinct clusters based on retail type or region, although it does broadly illustrate some important patterns that are evident within the data (Fig. 1, because tests detailed below failed to identify significant differences between samples collected in different seasons, the samples from individual retailers were combined across months). Interpretation of the PCA axis and eigenvectors (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Information 2) suggests blonde rays are the main constituent in sales from takeaways, whilst spotted rays are particularly important in fishmongers, leading to a degree of separation of retailer type in PC1. The PCA also illustrates how cuckoo, shagreen and small-eyed rays are largely absent in samples analysed from the ROI, occurring much more commonly in the analysis of UK ray wings.

The result of the ANOSIM when testing for a difference between the temporally replicated samples collected in January/February and October/November 2010 from Dublin was non-significant (R = 0.073, p = 0.052). As the result was close to the 95% confidence interval, tests were also made between the temporal replicates of the fishmongers (R = 0.091, p = 0.130) and takeaways (R = 0.017, p = 0.298) separately, which were also non-significant. In contrast, the comparison between Dublin fishmongers and takeaways was highly significant (R = 0.182, p = 0.001), with the SIMPER results demonstrating average dissimilarity of 69.89% between samples (with the highest contributions originating from the blonde and spotted rays, each contributing about a third of the total dissimilarity). Comparison of fishmongers in the ROI and the UK was non-significant (R = −0.12, p = 0.995).


Conservation issues
Across the study, no species with a vulnerable status on the redlist (IUCN, 2012), or an EU zero TAC, was identified. Given the severe declines in abundance of these skate species, this may simply reflect the relatively modest sample collection assembled here, but considerable efforts across the British Isles have been made to emphasise the conservation status and TAC limits placed on many skates (e.g., Seafish, 2013). Therefore, the complete absence of species of critical conservation concern may also reflect effective controls by the EU and efforts of fishermen and stakeholders to reduce landings of these groups. Perhaps a more stringent test of such action could be made in regions where threatened species are more locally abundant: e.g., R. undulata remains relatively common around the Channel Isles (Ellis, McCully & Brown, 2012), and analyses focused on this area could form a more rigorous test of effective landing controls. Interestingly, the largest growing species identified (R. brachyura) also occurred most frequently in the study. Maybe more awareness should focus on R. brachyura as size has been suggested as a good proxy for vulnerability to overexploitation (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002). R. brachyura, R. clavata and L. fullonica that were identified in the purchased wings are already included under the ‘near-threatened’ category in the IUCN redlist. R. brachyura is also listed under the red category in the Marine Conservation Society’s good fish guide (MCS, 2013), which suggests it should not be so extensively consumed. Perhaps guidelines on the maximum size of skate wings sold would increase consumer confidence that the products originate from sustainable sources and reinforce action to protect some of the vulnerable large growing species. This would certainly simplify consumer choice, but could potentially overlook trading or harvesting of juveniles from the large growing species that could go undetected due to their small size.


Variation in patterns of sale
This study represents a relatively intensive effort to collect samples from ray wings across multiple time-points, regions and countries, and goes beyond many previous investigations of seafood and mislabelling that focused on a single city, port or landing. Notwithstanding these efforts, it has resulted in a relatively modest sample collection. In part this reflects the fact that ray wings were not commonly available in some areas (particularly within the UK, where many retailers were visited that did not stock them), but it also reflects a desire to avoid high levels of repeat sampling from any one location or supermarket chain. It is hoped this approach gives the samples analysed a high degree of independence (not just repeatedly sampling from the same supply chains), producing a truly comprehensive examination of the sale of skates. Therefore despite the modest sample size, this study represents the first occasion that an investigation of the patterns of sale of ray wings can be made between retailer types, seasons and regions.
A highly significant difference was identified in species sold between fishmongers and takeaways within Dublin. The additional level of processing in takeaways provides greater opportunity for large wings originating from larger species to be divided before sale. Conversely, wings from smaller growing species may form more attractive sizes for sale in fishmongers. In recent years a number of supermarkets have also made a move towards selling wings from smaller skate species (Waitrose, 2009), marketing them as sustainably sourced ‘ray’ wings. As 28 of the ray wings sampled across the entire study in the fishmonger group originated from supermarket fish counters, this may help explain the difference in species sold. It is also interesting to note that whilst all the samples analysed were labelled as “ray” or “skate” (and all the species identified belonged to the Rajidae family, complying with broad expectations of the labels), one supermarket chain went further and specified its wings originated from three smaller growing species. In the six cases where wings were analysed from this chain two belonged to R. clavata that was not included on the label, therefore, demonstrating a 33% level of mislabelling within this small subset of samples. Overall, the sale of skates under ambiguous names remains a challenge to the consumers’ ability to exercise a right to choose those from less vulnerable groups.
A somewhat surprising result from the data analysis was the failure to identify any significant difference in the patterns of species sold in the January/February and October/November sample collections from Dublin. Many elasmobranch species are highly migratory, particularly with reference to specific nursery areas, with marked seasonal movements between the North Sea and Thames estuary for R. clavata having already been observed (Hunter et al., 2005). Therefore, it may be expected that such seasonal movements would affect capture vulnerability in commercial fisheries, and hence patterns of availability to consumers. One explanation for this result is that retailers will freeze stocks of fish to ensure a steady supply. In the case of skates, previous work suggests this is not common, even within takeaway shops, as the wings do not freeze well so supply was dependent on local fisheries (Miller & Mariani, 2013). However, much remains unknown about the exact provenance of samples sold, behaviour of fisherman and even the movements of skate species (Ellis et al., 2005), such that interpreting patterns of sale of skates remains difficult.
The same problems for interpretation occur when comparing sales of skate species in the different countries (ROI and UK), which were also non-significant. Perhaps this reflects the fact that the sale of ray wings in both countries exploits similar species and stocks of skates. Although in this case the comparison is also confounded by the fact that sample collection was conducted approximately two years apart. The only other study to utilise genetic methods of species identification on skate products was recently conducted by Lago, Vietites & Espineira (2012) in Spain. The 10 samples of whole or winged fresh skate analysed there originated not only from species found around Spain, but included groups restricted to other areas of Europe and even South America. This suggests patterns of sale could vary dramatically between countries or regions and they will not simply reflect levels of abundance in local fisheries.



Conclusions
This study represents the first intensive effort to investigate patterns in the sale of skate wings. The results show that no species with a vulnerable status on the redlist (IUCN, 2012), or with prohibited landings in the EU, appear to contribute to the market. Given the low abundance of many of these species further investigations may be required to accurately assess whether these groups may reach points of sale anywhere in Europe. Investigations at the point of landing, and throughout the supply chain, would also provide interesting insights into accuracy of identification and reveal if any species are landed, but withdrawn, before reaching retailers. The results also demonstrate significant differences between the retailers (fishmonger and takeaway) included in the study. Understanding why fishmongers also tended to sell smaller-growing species is challenging, but may relate to a desire to supply less vulnerable groups. This study also highlights that the use of ambiguous and amalgamated sales terms makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to choose species of lesser conservation concern. Interestingly, analysis of six wings from the only retailer to label its ray wings as originating from three smaller growing species showed two (33%) actually originated from R. clavata, a larger species with a decreasing population trend that is listed as near threatened on the IUCN redlist (IUCN, 2012).
