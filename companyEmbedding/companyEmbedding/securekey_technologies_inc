Interview 
	conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published  
	September 3, 2012


CEOCFO: 
	Mr. Walton, what attracted you to SecureKey and what skills do you bring to 
	the table that the company needs at this point in time?

Mr. Walton: 
	First, I have known the company since the beginning and I have been quite 
	close with Greg Wolfond, the founder and current CEO. We have great 
	chemistry between us, and over the years have developed a good friendship, 
	and then a partnership, with the company I am now leaving, INSIDE Secure. I 
	have followed SecureKey closely and am attracted by the fact that it is at a 
	fairly important inflection point of growth. 

 

The services of the company 
	have been validated by the Government of Canada and the Intel deal that has 
	been set in place has been quite substantial. I have been close to Intel 
	historically, so I understand the valid reasons for the Intel/SecureKey 
	connection. I am also quite attracted by the validation that has come from 
	strategic investors. The company is in a growth trajectory and I think that 
	with the investors that have recently come in, we have the capital, the 
	people, and the right services to lead forward to the next level. In many 
	respects, that has aligned well with my background and my history in 
	security and authentication. At INSIDE Secure I helped the company grow from 
	very early stages, when it was about the size of SecureKey now, to a much 
	more substantial company. The synergy amongst the core security technology, 
	my involvement in financial services, and the smart devices ecosystem is 
	ideal.


CEOCFO: What is it you are doing now and 
	what will you be doing a year from now?

Mr. Walton: 
	Today, the key thing is deployment of SecureKeys authentication services, 
	and really extending the power of chip-based ID and payment technologies for 
	online, PC-based and mobile-based transactions. SecureKey is currently 
	focused on serving the financial services sector, government, healthcare and 
	other industries where security, privacy and convenience are priority. One 
	of the key challenges of moving forward given the fairly broad applicability 
	of the SecureKey services will be the growth strategy. This is one of the 
	reasons that Greg has asked me to come into the company; it was really to 
	help map out a sensible strategy for growth. In many respects, being too shy 
	about growth or being too aggressive about growth could be the wrong thing 
	for the company. We are really trying to make sure that we are taking a very 
	pragmatic approach on growing the company, which means mapping out where we 
	take that growth, in geographies and in vertical markets. The focus of the 
	growth and that strategy is one of the key things that we will be working on 
	very early in my tenure at SecureKey.



CEOCFO: 
	What does SecureKey provide, and how does the service compare to what has 
	been done traditionally and some of the newer methods that are being looked 
	at as well?

Mr. Walton: 
	One of the nicest examples is a demonstration that was done earlier this 
	year at the CES conference in Las Vegas with Intel Corporation, a partner of 
	SecureKey. SecureKeys authentication technology is being incorporated into 
	Intels Identity Protection Technology and next generation Ultrabooks will 
	include SecureKey authentication services. The use-case demonstrated at that 
	conference is quite evocative of what we will begin to see from SecureKey. 
	Here a device, either a contactless smart card, or a mobile phone with NFC 
	(Near Field Communication) capability, was tapped against an Ultrabook 
	equipped with Intels identity protection technology  and by definition 
	SecureKeys authentication technology  to show on online payment 
	transaction. The information for purchase was form-filled, making the 
	payment transaction easy-to-use with either my card or NFC phone. That is a 
	terrific example of SecureKeys authentication technology. What sets 
	SecureKey apart is that with the mechanisms that have been bolted in, it has 
	been very simple to deploy. And for a user, nothing is simpler than waving 
	something they already have against their own Ultrabook device.



CEOCFO: 
	Is the public ready for the next level of security?

Mr. Walton: 
	Security is a funny thing; it does not have the appeal of a new iPhone, or 
	consumer electronic device, or flashy new gadget out there. But when 
	customers say they want to make a payment with their phone, or they want to 
	use their phone to open a hotel room door, you find that their concern is 
	whether their information is safe and if their privacy is maintained. I 
	would say that while the security services that SecureKey is offering do not 
	have the flashy appeal as consumer electronics, they are beginning to 
	address what has been a dominant issue on the part of consumers who are 
	intent on adopting new types of mobile services. We believe consumers will 
	absolutely gravitate to this; they will see that this is a way to secure 
	their data, that it has a very easy, intuitive feel that will ultimately 
	make their life easier and more secure. That is a win/win. In some sense, we 
	cannot really think about security as an over-arching consumer service, but 
	rather an innate part of performing online and mobile transactions with 
	integrity. We think SecureKeys technology will ultimately deliver great 
	value for the consumer.


CEOCFO: What is the competitive 
	landscape for SecureKey and what is it about your system that is superior?

Mr. Walton: 
	I would say that its the core technology that has been put together in a 
	manner that is properly balanced to deliver security conveniently. The 
	coupling of security with convenience has been done exceptionally well by 
	SecureKey. The underlying technical development of course contributes to 
	that. I would say that secondly, it is the companys approach into market:  
	becoming incorporated into the ecosystem; working closely with Intel; 
	establishing strategic investment relationships with the major card brands 
	in North America; and SecureKeys footprint into Government. The 
	award-winning, core security work, coupled with convenience and the market 
	approach, has been unique on the part of the company.


CEOCFO: Is it safe to assume that your 
	ideas have been protected properly?

Mr. Walton: 
	Yes, they have!


CEOCFO: You mentioned the Government of 
	Canada. What is going on there in terms of security?

Mr. Walton: 
	Well, as part of the Government of Canadas new online authentication 
	service, SecureKey was awarded a contract to provide a credential brokering 
	service that enables citizens to use their bank authentication credentials 
	to gain access to online services. This provides a way for a consumer with a 
	contactless card, or even in the future an NFC-equipped phone, to be able to 
	gain access to citizen-based functions. This leverages security credentials 
	that have been issued out in the world through the banks authentication 
	credentials and major payment groups.


CEOCFO: How do you keep up with all the 
	trends and changing technologies, considering that so many come and go?

Mr. Walton: 
	I think it is a matter of trying to envision the future. To date, SecureKey 
	has done a very good job of laying the foundation for access to services 
	through mobile devices. Having that vision, and being highly focused upon 
	it, will be key. The challenge going forward in the next year will be the 
	focus on growth that is not too fast or too slow, and making the right 
	choices on both partner and customer engagements. I would say that our 
	alignment with Intel has been very substantial. SecureKey has been very 
	fast-moving, has seen the future, and has made the right choices in the 
	early days on selecting opportunities and delivering. The next stage is to 
	begin widening the focus appropriately.



CEOCFO: 
	Will you be making changes or adding to the team as you continue in the 
	commercialization area, or is that still up for review?

Mr. Walton: 
	It is still up for review. I know Greg has put together a wonderful team and 
	the management team is topnotch. I would say the most critical thing is 
	setting up properly for growth. I do not see anything lacking at all in the 
	company. It is now a matter of growing in geographies and verticals that are 
	the best suited for us. That is where the focus will be through the coming 
	ninety days or so. 


CEOCFO: Development is expensive. Is the 
	company funded through the next steps?

Mr. Walton: 
	We recently concluded a fundraising round, which was a very substantial 
	round for the company, in the sense that we raised nearly $30 million. The 
	round was led by Intel and we were thrilled that they were able to do that. 
	We also brought new strategic investors Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Rogers 
	Venture Partners and TELUS into our equity mix.



CEOCFO: 
	Our readers are primarily investors and people are always looking at new 
	ideas, why should people pay attention to SecureKey?

Mr. Walton: 
	I see SecureKey at the center of a next wave of computing. In many respects 
	if we look at how computing changed in the 1995-2000 timeframe, we saw the 
	emergence of web browsers and servers, and of early stage ecommerce. The 
	landscape changed and never went back. 

 

We are now in the midst of 
	the next level of substantial change driven by mobility, which continues to 
	accelerate. This year, we have seen a flip as tablet-based devices were 
	deployed more substantially than PC-based laptop devices. We are beginning 
	to see more mobility with lightweight laptops, ultrabooks, tablets, smart 
	phones, and other lower-end smart phones. In the industry at large, we see 
	attacks on our computing devices becoming more substantial, so it is really 
	import to be laying down a solid authentication foundation to allow more 
	types of transactions to occur in a secure manner that is  convenient for 
	the consumer. I see SecureKey at the center of helping the industry to 
	secure many more types of transactions. SecureKey has focused on applying 
	security and authentication to mobile devices, which makes the company super 
	interesting. I have a great deal of excitement about that and is certainly 
	the reason I am on board.



CEOCFO: 
	Is there anything you would like to talk about that we have not covered?


Mr. Walton:

CIO Spotlight: The User Experience




CIO Spotlight: The Answer: SecureKey Concierge for eGovernment
Today, Canadians use a service called SecureKey Concierge for eGov, healthcare and some private sector services. It is backed by all the large banks in Canada, so users can access services using the same userid and password they use everyday for online banking. This is supported by a triple-blind privacy model so that government cannot see the user banking details, the bank cannot see the online destination the user is visiting, and SecureKey Concierge service does not know the identity of the user. So, none of the transaction participants has a complete picture of the user journey. 



CIO Spotlight: eGovernment Service Delivery – The Negative Spiral
The problem for eGovernment service delivery is it is caught in negative spiral with users when it comes to online access. Learn what we mean by a negative spiral in this video narrated by Andre Boysen, Chief Identity Officer at SecureKey.

Heartbleed: Anchor User Access in Trusted Devices
In what might be the most dramatic lapse of Internet security in history, the Heartbleed bug has shaken every corner of the web. Heartbleed threatens a web services in a wide variety of industries across the globe - 2/3 of the websites on the Internet used the compromised the OpenSSL technology. 



Enabling a Better Sign On Experience for your Customers
Governments and citizens both benefit when services are delivered online. But the adoption of online government services is often constrained by challenges with user registration and authentication. The usual problems of password security, forgotten passwords and sign-up abandonment are heightened for government services - they need to know its you to deliver the service. High credential churn drives up operational costs, weakens security posture, and frustrates users who want to accomplish tasks online. 



Banking 2020: mCommerce, Virtual Money, and Privacy. Are you ready?
In the year 2020, trends that are hot today, such as mCommerce, virtual money and privacy will be commonplace. These disruptive topics and technologies should be examined and considered when building a digital strategy. Organizations that choose to ignore them, might find themselves behind the curve.  



Embracing a Federated Consumer Identity Model to Increase Security & User Trust
Our digital identities are critical elements to our lives. Yet, most users today are managing more and more identities, with no end in sight.  



Is Mobile App In-Security Impeding Your App’s Adoption?
Mobile devices have become central to our daily lives. Whether it’s for work, pleasure or completing errands, mobile devices can do it all. Applications transform mobile devices into multi-purpose tools. However, the challenge for mobile app developers lies in engaging and gaining adoption of your app. 



Real-World Identity Authentication Simplicity … on the Internet
One of today's biggest challenges for Internet users today is the sheer number of IDs and passwords we need to manage our online life. With every single destination, users have dedicated user ID and password -- and we've kind of reached the point that that's not scalable any more. One alternative solution is to use credential federation, providing the user a smaller set of credentials to reach all of their online destinations.  



Introduction to SecureKey Concierge
SecureKey Concierge, is an innovative Credential Broker Service that allows Canadians to use their bank authentication credentials to access online services from the Government of Canada. Four of Canada’s largest banks are the initial Trusted Sign-In Partners, with other financial institutions expected to follow in the coming months. 



SecureKey Concierge Overview
It happens all the time. You go to log in to an online service, but forget your username and password. It’s frustrating and unfortunately, you’re not alone, as World Economic Forum estimates the average person has more than 130 online ID’s and passwords.

An Ecosystem Approach to Frictionless Digital Identity
The Commission on Enhancing National Cyber Security recently published its report on securing and growing the digital economy. Amongst its priorities, the report emphasizes the need for the administration to collaborate with the private sector on defining, implementing and defending a roadmap for i) improving the security of digital networks against denial-of-service, spoofing and others attacks on users and the nation’s network infrastructure, ii) increasing the use of strong authentication to improve identity management, and iii) delivering a frictionless experience to citizens while accessing Government services.

Consumer Digital Identity
This paper explores current issues and opportunities in emerging identity markets, and describes the rationale and technology paradigms for designing a consumer–centric, privacy-enhanced system using modern distributed architectures. 



Rethinking Identity in the 21st Century
Service providers are losing more of their customers’ credentials to online thieves than at any point in history. Customer interactions are slow, awkward and filled with mistrust. And it’s all happening because we’ve been thinking about identity the wrong way. 



Economics of Identity
‘Digital identity’ is becoming increasingly important to consumers in their daily lives. Coping with a growing number of usernames and passwords is a burden that deters customers from transacting digitally. The cost of maintaining accurate personal data for customers and protecting it from cyber criminals is a concern for organisations and regulators.

 The briidge.net Exchange Platform is used to build trusted identity networks by connecting users’ identity providers with their online services though a cloud-based broker service enabling BYOC. Designed specifically for large scale consumer and citizen communities.  The platform significantly lowers credential management costs for online service providers, while removing user sign-up barriers, preserving user privacy and providing greater user convenience.
Trusted credentials that are already in market from banks, governments, health care organizations, and payment providers can be utilized within briidge.net Exchange ecosystems. The platform allows identity providers and online services to integrate once, reducing the integration and business complexity otherwise incurred in establishing many-to-many relationships.

Enables BYOC
Removes sign up barriers and lowers operational costs
Eliminates forgotten passwords, password management and provisioning
Single Integration point providing access to multiple credential providers
Federated Single Sign On
Reduced data theft risks
Strong and trusted credential partners anchor the service
Enables social credentials with an improved privacy and improved trustability








 How it works
By design, briidge.net Exchange is optimized for privacy. Exchange serves as the broker, federating authentication and attribute sharing between credential providers and online services.  The platform governs the underlying trust model, gating and anonymizing information as required by the trust settings.  The system is configured to be “triple-blind”, ensuring that no party receives sensitive or personal information from the other parties.  The system also provides the user with fine-grained control and complete awareness of any attribute sharing. This focus on privacy puts the convenience of BYOC within reach of governments, banks and other services highly sensitive online services.







 Credential Options
Any credential issuer can easily be added as a credential supplier, including banks, social credentials and others. briidge.net Exchange provides out-of-the-box support for the US and Canadian Level of Assurance (LOA) schemes (FICAM/CATS).  Each service or federation of services can apply their own LOA assessments to participating credential suppliers and can configure LOA demands for each service.







 BYOC Customer Success Story
briidge.net Exchange is available for use with over 120 Government of Canada services. SecureKey Concierge enables users to sign in to government services using their online banking credential (BYOC). The number of services and participating banks continues to grow.

 Create a Foundation of Trust
To ensure your online services reaches their full potential, they require an authentication framework with flexible authentication levels to minimize friction while ensuring appropriate security. SecureKey Concierge enables governments to create a strong foundation for online services.







 Eliminate Forgotten Passwords
SecureKey Concierge eliminates password frustration by enabling consumers to conveniently and securely access online services — i.e. health benefits, student loan information, retirement benefit information and more — at multiple federal agencies without requiring a new username and password for each service.
Delivered through a secure cloud service, SecureKey Concierge grants users access to critical online services via their familiar online banking sign-in credential, eliminating the need to create yet another user ID and password. While using their trusted credential from a Sign-In Partner to access online services, SecureKey Concierge ensures that no passwords or personal information (name, date of birth, etc.) are shared or exchanged.
