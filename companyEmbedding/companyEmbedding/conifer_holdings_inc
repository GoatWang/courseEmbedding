About Conifer Insurance Company

A Specialty Insurance Company

Conifer Insurance Company provides customized insurance products for regional industry groups underserved by large national and international insurance companies. Conifer’s core expertise lies in servicing businesses operating in the hospitality industry, providing restaurants, bars and taverns with comprehensive coverages supported by knowledgeable management, underwriting and claims handling. Conifer Insurance Company is based in Michigan, and offers both admitted and excess & surplus lines capabilities which vary by state.
Sound underwriting and investment practices have earned Conifer Insurance Company a B++ [secure with “Good” ability to fulfill all obligations of policyholders] financial rating from insurance ratings agency, AM Best. Conifer is also supported by reinsurers with “A-” or better ratings.
Conifer was formed to address the problem of instability, limited coverages, and wild price fluctuations that were unrelated to the actual insurance risk in niche insurance segments. Large insurance companies providing coverage to Michigan industry groups were rating the Michigan risks the same as much higher risk groups and locations throughout the country.
Our mission is to exceed our clients’ needs with tailored insurance products delivered with exceptional customer service.

This resulted in higher premiums and unwarranted limitations on coverage protections. Conifer Insurance Company’s concept was to identify these industry groups that were being poorly served, and to develop customized insurance coverages that would provide premium relief, pricing stability and enhanced coverages. In the decades since the company started writing business, it has achieved these initial goals. This is reflected in its much higher than industry average insured retention rate.
Conifer Insurance Company seeks long-term partnerships with the industry groups and specialty insurance segments it serves. As part of its customer oriented, long-term approach, the company provides unique risk management services and continually reviews business risks to develop new coverages to address those risks. The company’s size and niche focus allows it to respond immediately to the needs of our insureds whether in Michigan or across the country.
The company continually reviews the coverage it provides to ensure it is providing the best possible coverage at the lowest cost for its business partners. Additionally, the insurance marketplace is routinely monitored to identify poorly or underserved industry groups for possible new business partners and insurance products.

We will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately
$28.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately
$33.3 million.

We expect to use $17.1 million (the estimated balance on our Revolver plus
accrued interest upon completion of this offering) of the net proceeds from this
offering to pay down our senior debt, $6.3 million (or $3.2 million after
netting out the proceeds from preferred shareholders who have agreed to use such
proceeds to purchase common stock) to repurchase outstanding preferred stock and
pay accrued preferred stock dividends and the balance of the proceeds to fund
the growth of our operating subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes. Our
preferred stock is perpetual, bears interest at 10% per year on the original
issue price, and accrues paid-in-kind ("PIK") interest at 4% per year,
compounded quarterly. The PIK interest is payable upon redemption.

In September 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit
agreement which increased the total amount available to borrow under the
Revolver from $10 million to $17.5 million and provided for a new term note for
$7.5 million. The additional borrowings were invested in our operating insurance
subsidiaries to support their continued growth.

Our credit facility consists of our $17.5 million Revolver, which matures August
1, 2016, and two term notes of $7.5 million (the "2014 Term Note") and $5.0
million (the "Original Term Note"). The 2014 Term Note matures September 29,
2019 and the Original Term Note matures July 1, 2018. The interest rate of the
Revolver and the Original Term Note at December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 was
LIBOR (as defined in the credit facility) plus 2.75%. The interest rate of the
2014 Term Note is LIBOR plus 3.25%. At March 31, 2015, we had $28.2 million of
borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, with $17.5 million of
borrowings on the Revolver. We had $38,000 of borrowings availability under the
Revolver at March 31, 2015.


The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and
except for certain regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers
to entry. In this fragmented market, we compete with both large national
insurance providers and smaller regional specialty insurance companies on the
basis of customer service, coverages offered, claims handling, price, agent
commission and financial strength ratings. Many of our competitors have higher
ratings, more capital, greater resources and additional access to capital than
we do. They may offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may
cover larger geographic markets. It is possible that new entrants to our markets
may arise and create additional competition, leading to potentially lower prices
and/or higher limits offered. To remain competitive our strategies includes,
among other measures: (i) focusing on underserved markets; (ii) maintaining a
deep understanding of the business and regulatory landscape of our markets;
(iii) placing an emphasis on flexibility in both the markets in which compete
and writing policies on an admitted and E&S basis; (iv) focusing on strong
relationships with our agents; (v) increasing our premiums written in existing
markets; (vi) expanding geographically in a prudent manner; (viii) engaging in
complementary acquisitions; and (ix) emphasizing a conservative risk management
approach.


Company Description
Conifer Holdings, Inc. is a Michigan-based insurance holding company formed
in 2009. Through our insurance subsidiaries, we offer insurance coverage in both
specialty commercial and specialty personal product lines. Many of our products
are targeted to profitable classes of policyholders that are


 underserved by
other insurers. We market and sell these insurance products through a growing
network of over 4,500 independent agents that distribute our policies through
their approximately 2,200 sales offices writing business in 44 states. We are
focused on growing our business in non-commoditized property and casualty
insurance markets, while maintaining underwriting discipline and a conservative
investment strategy. Our commercial lines and personal lines business accounted
for 65% and 35%, respectively, of net earned premiums for the three months ended
March 31, 2015 and 62% and 38%, respectively, of our net earned premiums for the
year ended December 31, 2014.

We have substantial expertise in serving the unique commercial insurance
needs of owner-operated businesses in the following markets:

. Hospitality, such as restaurants, bars, taverns, and bowling centers (that
  require, among other lines, liquor liability insurance), as well as small
  grocery and convenience stores;

. Artisan contractors, such as plumbers, painters, carpenters, electricians and
  other independent contractors;

. Security service providers, such as companies that provide security guard
  services, security alarm products and services, and private investigative
  services; and

. Automobile repair and used car facilities.

In our commercial lines business, we seek to differentiate ourselves and
provide value to small business owner-operators by bundling different insurance
products that meet a significant portion of their insurance needs. For example,
in the hospitality market we offer property, casualty, and liquor liability, as
well as, in some jurisdictions, workers' compensation coverage. The breadth of
our specialty commercial insurance products enables our small business
customers, many of whom do not have dedicated risk management personnel, and
their agents, to save the administrative costs and time required to seek
coverage for these items from separate insurers. As such, we compete for
commercial lines business based on our flexible product offerings and customer
service, rather than on pricing alone. Our target commercial lines customer has
an average account size of $5,000 in premium.

We also have substantial expertise in providing specialty homeowners' insurance
products to targeted customers that are often underserved by larger carriers or
other established providers of homeowners' insurance. Our personal lines
products include primarily the following:

. Catastrophic coverage, including hurricane and wind coverage, to underserved
  homeowners in Florida, Hawaii and Texas; and

. Dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower value homes, which we
  currently offer in Illinois and Indiana and plan to introduce in other
  geographic markets including Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina and South
  Carolina.

In our personal lines business, we target homeowners in need of specific
catastrophe coverage or dwelling insurance that are currently underserved by the
insurance market, due to the modest value of their homes or the exposure to
natural catastrophes in their geographic area. Because these homeowners are
underserved, this portion of the market is typically subject to less pricing
pressure from larger nationwide insurers that offer a more commoditized product.
We believe our underwriting expertise enables us to compete effectively in these
markets by evaluating and appropriately pricing risk. In addition, we believe
our willingness to meet these underserved segments of the personal lines
insurance market fosters deeper relationships with, and increased loyalty from,
the agents who distribute our products. Our target personal lines customer has
an average account size of $1,200 in premium.

Overall, we seek a balance of our premiums earned between commercial and
personal lines to better diversify our business and mitigate the potential
cyclical nature of either market. In serving these markets, we write business on
both an admitted and excess & surplus ("E&S") basis. Insurance companies writing
on an admitted basis are licensed by the states in which they sell policies and
are required to offer policies using premium rates and forms that are typically
filed with state insurance regulators. Non-admitted carriers writing in the E&S
market are not bound by most of the rate and form regulations imposed on
standard market companies, allowing them the flexibility to change the coverage
offered and the rate charged without the time constraints and financial costs
associated with the filing process. Our corporate structure allows us to offer
both admitted and E&S products in select markets through either Conifer
Insurance Company ("CIC") or White Pine Insurance Company ("WPIC"). Our
experience with specialty insurance products enables us to react to new market
opportunities and underwrite multiple specialty lines.

While we will pursue top line premium growth, we do not do so at the expense of
losing underwriting discipline. Our underwriters have the experience and
institutional flexibility to recognize when to exit certain products in favor of
more profitable opportunities as insurance market conditions dictate.
