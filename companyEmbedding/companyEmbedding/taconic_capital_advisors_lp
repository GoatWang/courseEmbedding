Taconic Capital



 



Who We Are
Taconic Capital is a global institutional investment firm that pursues an event-driven, multi-strategy investment approach. Taconic was founded in 1999 by former Goldman Sachs partners, Frank Brosens and Ken Brody. Taconic has a differentiated economic and compensation model that we believe enables us to attract and retain top talent.
We have offices in New York, London and Hong Kong with over 100 employees. We are privately held and our partnership owns, governs and leads the firm. Taconic Capital’s first fund was launched in June 1999 and began accepting outside capital in 2000. We opened our London office in 2001 and our Hong Kong office in 2012. Over the last 18 years, we have continuously evolved, adding investment capabilities, management talent and geographic reach to capitalize on the changing opportunity set, and to meet the needs of our firm and investors.
Investment Approach
Taconic Capital follows a disciplined, replicable investment process that aims to identify investment opportunities with three distinct elements: inefficiencies, catalysts and a margin of safety. We are opportunistic investors and agnostic as to where in the capital structure an investment is made. We have a collaborative, team-oriented culture with an open communication architecture that enables real-time decision-making among investment team members across asset classes, specialties and geographies. Taconic Capital evaluates, adjusts and manages risk, supported by a balance between qualitative and quantitative metrics.

                                A PeopleClaim letter-rating represents our opinion of a company’s reliability based
                                on, among other factors, their response to complaints filed by PeopleClaim users.
                                Higher ratings generally reflect a history of constructively responding to all complaints
                                filed through our system, or no history of claims filed against the company through
                                PeopleClaim. See Terms of Use
                                for full details.

                                WeCare is PeopleClaim's business-friendly interactive profile that lets you connect
                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.
