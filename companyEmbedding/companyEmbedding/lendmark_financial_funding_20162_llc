Fitch to Rate Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-A | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-A
    





February 19, 2016 04:29 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-A (LFT 2016-A) 
      as follows:
    

      -- $133,468,000 class A notes 'BBB+sf(exp)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $32,780,000 class B notes 'BBsf(exp)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $13,432,000 class C notes 'Bsf(exp)'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Adequate Collateral Quality: The LFT 2016-A collateral pool comprises 
      secured and unsecured fixed rate personal loans and sales finance 
      contracts originated by the company based on its underwriting 
      guidelines. The portfolio will also include renewed loans that will 
      replace or refinance the existing loan. Additional eligible loans will 
      be added to the portfolio during the Revolving period ending Jan. 31, 
      2018.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization (OC) and excess spread. The initial OC of 
      approximately $20.65 million will be maintained for the life of the 
      transaction. Additionally, the class A notes will benefit from 
      subordination provided by the class B and C notes, and the class B notes 
      will benefit from subordination provided by the class C notes. In 
      addition, trust performance and other triggers based on credit and 
      servicing risks are used to provide additional protection for investors 
      should loan performance or certain counterparties' financial conditions 
      deteriorate (each an early amortization event). When an early 
      amortization event occurs, the Revolving period will end and note 
      amortization will begin.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: A reserve account sized at $2 million, which 
      equals 1% of the initial pool balance with a floor at 1% of the initial 
      pool balance, will be funded at closing.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Lendmark Financial Services LLC. will 
      service 100% of the portfolio. Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (Wells Fargo) is 
      the back-up servicer and image file custodian. Fitch considers all 
      parties acceptable servicers. Wells Fargo in its capacity of image file 
      custodian will retain electronic copies of all imaged files of each loan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      As Fitch's base case default proxy is derived primarily from historical 
      collateral performance, actual performance may differ from the expected 
      performance, resulting in higher loss levels than the base case. This 
      will result in a decline in available CE, and the remaining loss 
      coverage levels available to the notes and may make certain note ratings 
      susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in the coverage. Rating sensitivity results should 
      only be considered as one potential outcome, given that the transaction 
      is exposed to multiple dynamic risk factors. Rating sensitivity should 
      not be used as an indicator of future rating performance.
    

      Holding all other inputs constant, a 15% increase in base case defaults 
      resulted in a downgrade of at least three rating categories for the 
      notes.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The 
      third-party due diligence focused on comparing the sample 
      characteristics provided in the data file of 47,103 consumer loans to 
      the corresponding information in the loan agreements. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have any 
      impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.

            Learn about ConsumerAffairs for Brands!Consumer Complaints and ReviewsJavel of Decatur, GA on July 3, 2017Satisfaction RatingI paid off my car loan. Then waited approximately 45 days to receive the title. I never did and the manager I had talk to was not in. So, I went to the main Department of Revenue (on a Friday) to obtain the title. Once I got there I was told Lendmark had it. Then I found out it was in the manager's desk drawer! I asked them to overnight it to me because I had been waiting for the title in order to sell the car. They waited until Monday to overnight it to me! No sense of urgency with this company. But, they certainly want their money on time! I will never use them again!!! I contacted the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint against them and they never responded to them. BEWARE they are not with the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU, nor have to answer to them. They want your money but they provide VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!UPDATE ON 07/10/2017: I reported earlier the misfortune I had with Lendmark sending my title. To make matters worse, I just found out they sent the wrong title. They all of a sudden found a more up-to-date title, after I called to say the Department of Motor Vehicles would not accept the title for the new owner to register the vehicle. I was livid!! They never bothered to send the right title. They do not need to be in business. The manager blamed it on poor staff. She is part of the poor staff!! Her name is Amy... Only do business with Lendmark if you want heart-ache and PROBLEMS!Helpful?YesNoSherrie of Eden, NC on June 14, 2017Satisfaction RatingI took out a loan for a dire emergency with Lendmark. Everything was going well until I fell into a hardship situation. I even know the employees that work for the local branch I went to in Collinsville, VA. We worked together at another finance company previously. Lendmark employees went into my checking account on 3 occasions without my permission and took out money. I had them blocked at the bank and called the local office & was told by the manager she actually heard the conversation with myself & the employees. I advised that was a blatant lie & I wanted to hear the recording. Never was I allowed to. So I stopped paying until I could speak with the corp. office who has yet to respond to my calls & letter. Now I have been threatened with legal action. So guess I will be contacting myself an attorney. I would NEVER recommend them to anyone.Helpful?YesNoluther of Strunk, KY on April 25, 2017Satisfaction RatingMy payment is due on the 20th and I wasn't going to have the money until the 2nd of the next month. She said she would not wait for me to pay it then so I ask or what and she would not give me a direct answer. So I directly ask her if she was going to take my truck or what and would not give me a direct answer. She said that I could write them a check and it would not go through my bank until the 2nd of the next month. I told her that I did not want to do that because if they send it through it would cost me a 29 dollar overdraft fee on my account. Her response was that it was better than lawyer fees which I took as a threat. Refused to answer questions that I ask her and only want to have me listen to her and not say a word.Then she told me that if my payment was one day late they could take my truck so I ask her if that's what they was going to do and she refused to give me a straight answer. I know they have to try and keep things on time but things happen and they could charge a crap load of charges and the interest rate is ungodly. I would like to change my account to my local bank and tell this woman to stick it. Just because she is new and power hungry does not mean that she has to be a witch.Helpful?YesNoJo Ann of Jasper, FL on April 17, 2017Satisfaction RatingCalled Lendmark today to see what my payoff would be. Tells me price higher than what is showing on statement. Apparently when you make a payment they only take off interest and not whole payment. Does not make any sense. Also tried to make half payment put one time and was told they could only accept whole amount and by end of month.Helpful?YesNoLinda of Canyon Country, CA on March 16, 2017Satisfaction RatingI consolidated a previous loan with these sharks. We did the loan in 2016 November. We came into money and decided to get rid of this burden at 32%. Tried to pay it off over the phone and no help. Tried online and wouldn't let me. Loan was 5 thousand and we went through futile attempts to pay it off. Now we need to drive 57 miles to get rid of it. Unscrupulous and dishonest. Steer clear they are loan sharks! Next step Consumers Affairs!Helpful?YesNo

They say they don't care about being broke. I tell them, "I have stuff come up will you work with me?" They say, "No," and charged me $1500 for a $1200 bunk bed. I tell them my money gotten short and my wife left me. They just laugh at me and threaten to take me to court. I told them I pay half and they want take it at all. But I overheard them taking half from another customer. They always laugh at me for no reason. Just because I got behind on the bill one month don't mean I won't pay, but half; but they laugh at me and tell I don't need food. They need food and their money. They don't care if I break down. They are always laughing at me.Helpful?YesNoEVELYN of Baltimore, MD on March 8, 2017Satisfaction RatingI had the worse time with the Lendmark and the lawyer office Fradkin and Weber whom they sent my judgment too. I tried to pay them and they did not know when and where the letter was going to be sent, they held my bank account for over 30 days when I tried to pay them, their staff did not know how to answer the questions that they should have been trained on, my bank tried to help them retrieve my funds and they did not know how to. I can keep on and on. This has been the worse experience of my life!!! No one should have a judgment against them but if you are trying to correct it and you are dealing with a company that does not understand how to collect the debt, never borrow money from them!!! I will call a family member or a stranger before I use their services again.Helpful?YesNoLanaye of Charlotte, NC on March 8, 2017Satisfaction RatingI got a loan from them out of absolute necessity when they were Springleaf. Lendmark has purchased them. Now I am in a position to pay the loan down if not pay it completely. When I called about a payoff amount, I was told that it was practically identical to my balance. In other words, for me to pay them off I have to pay off the entire balance.Most of the time, with a loan, if you pay it off early, you aren't required to pay all of the interest that would be accrued if you paid it off for the full duration of the loan. Apparently, these people don't operate like this. Like everyone else said, they put up a good front. They seem professional and legit but these are predatory lenders who prey on people in need. Stay away or prepare to be taken advantage of. And, I would have rated this zero stars had that been an option.Helpful?YesNoMark of Durham, NC on Feb. 28, 2017Satisfaction RatingWas not properly advised of what was being done. I was looking to get my current loan up to date and called to discuss my options. I was told I could get some additional money and was asked how much I wanted. I said an $1000 so they did what they had to do and called and told me I was approved. So I go to the office to sign the paperwork and had told them I was in a rush. So I was sat down and was given the paper to sign got my check and went back to my office. The next day I had the opportunity to sit down and read my terms of the loan and saw that I was being charged like $2700 more. So I said I would call them later that week. The next few days went by and I received a letter from some insurance company and Lendmark saying that I had order this additional insurance coverage and that why was charged more for the loan. It also said I had 30 days to cancel it. I called the office and was told yeah they did add this coverage for me and I asked when was that disclosed to me. Nevertheless, I told them I wanted to cancel it and then I was told I can but I would still be charged that amount on my loan. So my choice was either give the money to some insurance company or take the additional cash for my loan. So me asking for an additional $1000 I ended up getting additional $3700 loan. To me this was a sham and I was tricked into taking out a higher loan amount than what I asked for. So now I'm thinking about filing bankruptcy because I didn't agree to this and then didn't have any way out of the dollar amount. Take my advised and stay away from this company.Helpful?YesNoRandi of Gwynn Oak, MD on Feb. 27, 2017Satisfaction RatingCollection harassment at its finest: I have a loan through Lendmark Financial (Baltimore Maryland) and will encourage any & everyone to BEWARE of their collection practices. I've contacted the FTC about their collection and harassment practices and got an intent to sue letter the next day for an account that was not even 30 days past due. They call faithfully to your home, cell, or employer requesting a payment, including one day after the due date, although they have a grace period for payments.Helpful?YesNoChristopher of Grampian, PA on Feb. 3, 2017Satisfaction RatingThese people are very unprofessional. They contacted me about getting a loan through them so we go through all the information on the phone then they ask me to give them collateral so we go through that process. At the end the guy tells me he has to go talk to his manager real quick. He will be right back. He comes back and states that they don't want to work with me. Everything on my credit is current. I had a period from when I got out of the military that hurt me because nobody would hire me due to disability from me getting hurt overseas.During this time I could not work so me and my family had a rough 1 1/2 years of bills and just trying to survive. I waited that long for my claim to go through the VA but I tell this guy this and he says "well that's not our fault you could not pay your bills because you was hurt." I said "oh really. You feel that way about the disabled military veterans." He just laughed and hung up the phone. I will do everything I can to take customers or potential future customers away from them.Helpful?YesNosteven of Sharpsburg, NC on Feb. 1, 2017Satisfaction RatingJeff at the Rocky Mount NC location near Walmart has a serious attitude problem. He tries to intimidate and scared people into making payments when you're not even 60 days late. He leaves voice-mails that I frankly don't think is appropriate but I guess LENDMARK does. Again I'm talking about my experience with Jeff. Glenn has been excellent so far. Will keep you all updated about this branch/location.Helpful?YesNoG. of Stafford, VA on Jan. 27, 2017Satisfaction RatingI had no choice dealing with this company. I had to get a new furnace and my heating and AC company deals with this company. My original purchase was in the neighborhood of $5500, however, even though I officially owe around $4200 right now, my statement says I owe around $7600. When I called a few times to have this changed, they not only saw nothing wrong with it, they said they were 'unable' to change it. When I mentioned how this inaccurately displays on my credit report as owning more than I technically do, they didn't care.Besides that, I have fallen behind 2 payments and have been nonstop threatened (to 'go to the attorney's office'), harassed (call taker being unpleasant, rude, and demanding), lied to (called multiple occasions and then they couldn't find a record of the conversation, was told that I would only need to pay $7.58 for the monthly payment to keep my account only 1 month behind but the following week was told that whoever I spoke to was incorrect and therefore that payment didn't mean anything, and they continued to harass me), get disturbing letters about collections when it was only a few days past due, etc... I've been late on other things and have never been treated so poorly!!For instance, just now, I received a call from them demanding payment today. I actually believe they are putting words in my mouth. I said I would get a paycheck Feb 10th and believe I made it clear that I want to pay this bill but that I don't have the money this exact day. She said that if I didn't pay it today that it would 'go to the attorney's office'. You know, if you want to work for collections, the best way of doing your job would be to WORK WITH your customers, not bully or harass them. I know I owe this money and I'm sorry I was unemployed for 7 months by being laid off, and I'm trying to pay it off. If I call in and WORK OUT payment arrangements, don't call me the next week with a completely different story and then throw it in my face when I can't pay it. I would NEVER, EVER use this company again! They should be ashamed of their conduct (I've spoken to several people at Lendmark Financial). Now come to this site - I see I'm not the only one! My interest rate is around 28% and they 'offered' to refinance my loan to 35%. Do they think I'm stupid?Helpful?YesNoNjeri of Greenbelt, MD on Jan. 24, 2017Satisfaction RatingI got a loan from Lendmark Financial in 2011 for 5000. After paying on the loan for almost 4 years, I requested a payoff because I assumed I was almost finished paying. I was told that after paying for 4 years I still owe just about what I borrowed $4980. They told me that all my payments went to interest and late fees. I attempted to settle for $4,000 but they would not accept it. They would not negotiate with me at all. After a few months, they filed a judgment. At court, I asked the attorney if I could settle the account again for $4,000. He told me he would take it back to the Creditor and get back to me. I called him and never heard back. This company also has other companies that will mail you letters stating that they are trying to assist you but they actually work with Lendmark I believe. Two months after the Judgment was filed, I got a wage garnishment. This company is a crook and should be put out of business. It's a shame that consumers have no rights in matters like this. I believe in capitalism but this is ridiculous.Helpful?YesNoTiffany of Greenville, SC on Dec. 19, 2016Satisfaction RatingLendmark Financial is a company I would not recommend to anyone. I fell late on my payments and now I have to appear in court. Lendmark filed a civil suit to collect on a payoff that should be less, they filed because I was 60 days behind. This is poor customer service but they have an arbitration clause in their contact to help resolve any disputes that they are clearly violating if they are taking people to civil court. Something should be done to companies that use the court system to try and scare people into paying. No one wants to fall behind in paying their bill. It's just sometimes things happen that you have no control over. Then you have companies like this that uses this against you.Helpful?YesNotimothy of Dallas, GA on Dec. 8, 2016Satisfaction RatingLet me start off by saying that I always try to avoid predatory lending but this company puts on a good front. It looks like they are legit with a decent office and some sort of affiliation with BB&T Bank. If you can take any advice about finding a loan (no matter what your financial situation is or credit score) do not go here! They have high interest rates and constantly want to refinance your loan to trap you. After about six month of paying they will send and call with offers to get an additional amount of money so they can trap you in their predatory scheme. Then when you get too far behind they will attempt to take you to court. Falling behind 60 days is unacceptable and they will take you to court! They completely took advantage of myself and family by taking me to court in a different state and of course winning because they knew I couldn't be present 500 miles away. I was only 60 days behind with a payment set up to draft from my bank account. They do not care! They will take full advantage of the law (that works in their favor). I had to drain my savings account to pay them off in full which brings me to another point... Good luck trying to pay them the money they took you to court for. It took 2 weeks to pay these people because of all the crap you have to jump through just to get them money. Not to mention they will continue the legal process by freezing your bank accounts and sending garnishment letters to your employer. Luckily I had a joint savings account in a complete separate state they couldn't freeze so I could get them the money! This is a payday loan multiplied by 1000. No matter how desperate you are for money, no matter how hard times get do yourself a favor a beg on the street before going through the hell that this company will put you through. To top it all off after it was finally paid the Lendmark representative stated "do not let this discourage you from attempting to apply for a loan in the future from us". Wow! If I could buy negative stock in a company I would gladly invest!Helpful?YesNoShawn of Pequea, PA on Aug. 4, 2016Satisfaction RatingI got a loan through Lendmark in 2015. In Feb. of 2016 I had a bad fall and was going to be out of work for at least 3 months. I called them right away about this and they took care of my payments while I was off. No hassle whatsoever. I get calls from them all of the time to let me know how much funds I have available to me in case I need to borrow more, and to make sure that I am happy with their service. My husband also has a personal loan through them. Again no problems.Helpful?YesNoApril of Chesterfield, VA on July 25, 2016Satisfaction RatingI would NEVER do business with this company. The customer service they provide is beyond farther than the worst I have ever seen. During my "application process", not once did I receive a phone call from anyone, even after leaving several messages for them to call me. I received a letter in the mail 2 weeks later. They are crazy to think I would continue doing business with them. I would rather take my business to another company and pay a higher interest rate, than to ever have them gain me as a customer. I think being made to feel like you are just "another number", would be a step above how I was treated. I am in my mid 30's, and own a very successful real estate title company, and I would NEVER in a million years treat anyone like they treated me. With as many contacts as I have in many areas of the community, I will definitely make sure that everyone I know will know exactly what a terrible company this is to do business with.Helpful?YesNoLisa of Martinsburg, WV on July 6, 2016Satisfaction RatingI just had my first garnishment to my paycheck without any warnings from Lendmark in Hagerstown, MD. I cosigned with my now ex-boyfriend on a motorcycle that was repossessed. In fact, after them calling me several times, I told them where to find the motorcycle! When I called after the repo and asked if there was a balance, I was told no the balance was zero. I checked my credit report and it said balance of zero. I have checked my credit report several times over the past few years and the Lendmark account for the motorcycle has been zero. Now 4-5 years later with no written letters; no phone calls, I am having my wages garnished! The original loan papers had my address and phone number as I was the primary applicant. My ex-boyfriend was co-applicant as my credit score was much high than his at the time.When we separated, he kept the motorcycle as it was his. He made the monthly payments until I heard from you that he was behind and you needed to repossess it. When he moved, he apparently changed the account address to his new place of residence, therefore I never received any notifications. I understand I signed the paper and am responsible for the balance but where is Lendmark's responsibility in letting me know there was a balance? You had my address and phone number! I took responsibility and helped you find the motorcycle. I took responsibility and CALLED THEM to see if there was a balance and I was told zero balance! Now instead of the original balance, I owe a lot more due to interest, court costs, and debt collector's fees!!! And you are NOT even garnishing my ex-boyfriend's wages when he is working and living in the Hagerstown/Sharpsburg area!! WHY NOT?? They have his SS number. You can't tell me they or the debt collecting company can't find him! When I called the Hagerstown Lendmark office and talked to the manger, he was very rude, unprofessional, uncaring, and downright mean! He wouldn't listen to me. He wouldn't let me speak without him interrupting and continually saying "You signed the papers. You're responsible." He kept saying that it didn't matter that the office people told me zero balance. That they must have been looking at the wrong screen. He was raising his voice to me and interrupting me, so I hung up and called your 800 number. Your 800 number person even told me I had A ZERO balance that day! They switched me over to their lawyer. She was very nice and compassionate. She got my file and looked at it and said she would research it back to the beginning and call me back in an hour. She never called me back but I figured she needed more time to research it. I waited 2 days and finally called her. I was told that she was not in and wouldn't be back till after the weekend. I waited and still have not heard from her. Guess I'll be calling again. STAY away from this company!!Helpful?YesNoSharon of Madison, OH on June 7, 2016Satisfaction RatingWOW! I just got this email and I had no idea what it was for so I called the number and they told me they couldn't give me any information! She did say my name though, Sharon. She said it came up on her caller ID. Then she told me that my name is not on the account and that they do not have any of my banking information on file! Who can I report these people to???

They tell me they have my MasterCard on file and everything. The trouble is I have never subscribed to any magazines and I don't want them. When I told her that, she told me she could cancel any renewals on the account but I would still have to pay for the first 20 months. I have been reading some of the other reviews on this company and you need to stay away from them.Helpful?YesNoDiane of Opelika, AL on March 9, 2016Satisfaction RatingI have received several pre-approved loans from the company Lendmark and each time I apply I am denied. I want to be taken off your mailing list and do not ever contact me again. Pre-approved means pre-approved. I am not going to recommend any of my family or friends to do business with this company. What is the point in sending out pre-approved letters if you are not going to try and help the customers. The closest Lendmark company is in Opelika, Alabama and you can take the pre-approves and shove it. I had a offer code ** valid until April 1, 2016.Helpful?YesNoDenise of Lexington, SC on Feb. 3, 2016Satisfaction RatingTook out a 6000.00 loan in Aug 2015, paid them 5900.00 in Sept.160.00 in Oct. 2015. Called for the balance in Dec and was told 45.20. Paid that thinking loan was paid, I was done with Lendmark. In Jan 2016 I get a bill saying I owe 6500.00. I called to see how this could be possible. They said I had a balance and every month it wasn't paid. I was being charged 216.00 a month in interest, but no one could tell me what my balance was that I was being charged. Very deceptive practice, invoices received never give the actual payoff amount. Consumers beware of this company!Helpful?YesNoChelsea of Baltimore, MD on Jan. 11, 2016Satisfaction RatingI got a loan with Lendmark back in 2014, they were nice when I went in for my loan (of course), and I never had any issues as I always made payments on time. In November of 2015 I signed up for a debt management program. I have a lot of debt and after exploring my options, this was the best thing for me. It would allow me to continue to pay my creditors something and have money to put into savings. My debt management company called me and stated I needed to call Lendmark because "they had some questions."So, I gave them a call on a Monday and had to speak to the manager (this is at their Overlea, MD location on Belair Road). From the moment he got on the phone, he was rude. His exact words to me were "Debt management is going to ruin your credit, just so you know. And I'm not enrolling in that program, you make your payments on time, so what good would it do for me?" Yes, I've always attempted to make my payments on time, but I was coming to them to let them know it is now a struggle and I most likely will miss payments, this option would be the best. He again said "I only accept like 5 debt management proposals a month and since you make your payments on time, I'm not accepting it." What a jerk! I've been a loyal paying customer for over a year, and I come to them with an issue and this is how I get treated. I even recommended family to them. NEVER AGAIN! I cannot wait to pay off this loan and be done. The worst, ever.Helpful?YesNoTrevor of Kennesaw, GA on Dec. 31, 2015Satisfaction RatingI visited the location in Kennesaw, GA and got a loan for $4000. And I've paid them a little over $3100 back in a year and not one dollar has went to my principal. So I still owe them $4000. That's **. I didn't sign up for a loan to where they would be charging me 100 percent interest and fees every month. And then if you are 1 day late, they will call you 3 to 4 times a day and leave you voicemails saying that they will sue you if you don't pay them within the next 3 days. So if you need a loan, run away and go to a real bank.Helpful?YesNoLisa of Dunellen, NJ on Nov. 1, 2015Satisfaction Rating6 months ago I took out a loan of $3,000 for the moving in deposit of my new apt. I was one month late trying to get my new place situated. I am a student pursuing graduate studies. I called to ask for a reduced payment. RUDE! THEY ARE PREDATORY AND EVIL!! Stay away from Lendmark! I fell victim to them! The Lendmark Office is in Frederick, Maryland.Helpful?YesNoshantese of Baltimore, MD on Oct. 20, 2015Satisfaction RatingI took a loan with them and was making my payments on time sometimes more than what I was suppose to. For a few months (3) I fell behind a little due to job problems and still kept in contact with them on updates. They took me to court. I caught back up and was making regular payments again to find out they garnished my checks at work. Shady. I tell you go to hell before doing business with them! Or good luck.Helpful?YesNoarleen of Randallstown, MD on Sept. 9, 2015Satisfaction RatingLendmark is predatory lending company. Stay away! I paid my account and was told the funds were applied to another account when I put the account # on the check. The person acted shock when I told her I could get payment history from my bank and the checks had cleared.Helpful?YesNoSteven of Helena, GA on Aug. 29, 2015Satisfaction RatingI was a customer of theirs for 4 years. Always paid my bills on time and was able to get out from under them. Well I took out a loan and used it against my truck in 2013 to help my now ex-wife get some items to open a bakery. Well all was well... still paying them on time and everything until me and my wife split up. I had to move out of state and start my life all over again and let Lendmark know what was going on and when I find a job I will resume paying the payments I owed them. I thought it was going to be fine because they said it would be fine and since I was a customer for so long that they would cut me some slack.Well about a month ago I looked outside and saw my truck was gone, without a note nor a warning. I called them to see if I could get my vehicle back and the manager said he would call me the next day. Well I didn't get the call and all I got was a letter saying I lost my truck and it was going to get sold. Today I got a notice in the mail stating I still owe 10 dollars toward my account. I had no idea I wasn't going to be able to get my vehicle back. I got you Lendmark. You are a P.O.S company and I hope you go down in flames.Helpful?YesNoNORMAN of Clinton, MD on Aug. 3, 2015Satisfaction RatingLendmark Financial is a shady business and they need to be investigated. I took out a loan because I fell on hard time for a moment. I have paid them on time every month even when I broke my ankle and leg in June 2014 and had no income coming in. I missed one payment in Jan. 2015 because I had just returned to work from my injury and had to catch up on other bills. I made Jan. and Feb. payment the first week of March. Only Jan. payment was late. I hadn't been late since and they sued me for 2000 plus dollars for being late 1 month of ca $113.00 and it's on my credit report as a judgement of default for 2150 and I'm still making payments on time. Please if and is in drowning do not ask Lendmark Financial for help. You will be forever paying them off. 2000 will cost you 5000 after interest has increased.Helpful?YesNoExpert ReviewBarbara FriedbergPersonal Finance Contributing EditorBarbara Friedberg, MBA, MS is a former investment portfolio manager with decades of financial experience.

        	Top
        	CostWhen you take out a loan, chances are you’re thinking more about the cost of the item you’ll purchase with the loan money than about the cost of the loan itself. If you don’t consider the loan cost, that item could end up costing much more than you expect. To ensure that you get the best deal on a loan, make sure you understand all fees associated with it and how interest will accumulate.Interest rate: The interest rate is the money a lender charges you when you borrow money and is a percentage of the total amount borrowed. Your credit score will influence the interest rate a lender charges, because they will charge people deemed higher risk a higher rate. If your loan doesn’t have pre-payment penalties or precomputed interest, you’ll save money on interest by paying your loan off early.
                                    APR: The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is often confused with the interest rate; however, the APR actually accounts for the total cost of the loan, including any one-time fees. When comparing loan offers, look at the APR to get the best price comparison.
                                    Origination fee: The origination, or processing, fee, is a one-time charge that covers the cost of processing a loan. This fee is typically included in the overall loan amount, so you aren’t required to pay it up front.
                                    Pre-payment penalties: Some lenders charge a fee if you pay off your loan early. These fees help the lender make up the money they lose in interest, but they also prevent people from getting out of debt early when they’re able to.
                                    Precomputed interest: Loans with a precomputed interest rate use the original amount instead of the outstanding balance to determine the amount of interest a consumer will pay each billing cycle. This method means your payments may get smaller as time passes. However, if you pay the loan off early, you won’t save any money on interest.
                                    Late payment fees: Most lenders will charge a fee if you pay your bill late. Avoid that fee by setting up autopay from your bank account or just put a reminder on your calendar to keep you on track.
                                    Payment processing fees: Some lenders charge a fee to pay your bill in a certain way. For example, some lenders may charge a small fee if you pay your bill by phone or using a check instead of setting up automatic electronic withdrawals. Make sure you understand these fees and choose a lender that allows you to make your payment in the way you want for free.
                                    TrustworthinessWhen working with a lender, you should choose someone you feel comfortable with and who is trustworthy. In general, if you’re taking out a mortgage or auto loan from a well-established bank or credit union, you can feel confident in the lender’s credibility. If you’re working with an online loan company or new business, make sure to fully research the company to avoid being scammed. Scams may be most likely to occur with unsecured, personal loans.Hold loans vs. flip loans: Determine whether the lender you’re working with will hold the loan after you close or if they’ll flip, or sell, it to another party. While lenders who flip loans aren’t more or less trustworthy than those who don’t, you’ll have to simply accept that the company they sell your loan to will be trustworthy and offer good customer service.
                                    Customer service: Consider how easy it is to get in touch with your lender now to determine if they’ll be easy to reach later if you have any problems. Also consider how patient they are in answering your questions. They should be willing to address all your concerns and explain anything you’re confused about.
                                    Registered: Lenders must be registered to do business with the appropriate authority, usually the department of banking or consumer credit, in every state in which they do business. You can find a list of state licensing authorities on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System & Registry website.
                                    Mortgage broker vs. loan officerWhen taking out a loan, you’ll have the choice to work with either a mortgage broker or a loan officer. There are perks to each one, so it is important to know the difference.Loan officer: Loan officers work for the bank or lender, so getting a loan through them may be faster than working with a mortgage broker. These individuals are primarily accountable to their employer, so they may not always make recommendations that are best for you.
                                    Mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers are a kind of middle-man between those seeking loans and multiple lenders. If you’re worried that your credit may make it difficult to get a loan, consider working with a broker because they can help you decide which lender is most likely to approve you. These individuals may also be able to help you find a better interest rate because they’ll be comparing multiple lenders.
                                    Other considerationsThere are a variety of other factors to consider when borrowing money. If at any point during the process you’re confused, make sure to discuss the matter with your lender.Expertise: Look for a loan company that specializes in the type of loans you’re considering. If you’re working with a big bank, ask whether they have loan officers who specialize in certain types of loans.
                                    Credit report: All consumers are entitled to get one free report from each credit reporting company every year. If you’re considering taking out a loan, request one of your credit reports as far in advance as possible to make sure no inaccurate information appears on it. Many credit cards show you your credit score for free; knowing your credit score may help you decide whether to work with a loan officer or mortgage broker.
                                    Down payment: If you’re taking out a mortgage or car loan, consider how much of a down payment you’re able to make. The larger your down payment, the less money you’ll need to borrow. Saving a little longer to have a larger down payment could save you a significant amount of interest later.
                                    Special programs: Many homebuyers qualify for special program loans, like FHA or VA loans, for example. Research these options to determine whether you qualify for any special programs before taking out a loan.
                                    Private mortgage insurance: Individuals who qualify for a mortgage but do not have a down payment that accounts for 20 percent of the home’s value may be required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI), which will allow the lender to recover money if the borrower defaults on the loan. This insurance does not offer any protection to borrowers. PMI is usually between .5 and 1 percent of the total amount of the loan.
                                    What are different types of loans?
        	Top
        	Secured loansSecured loans rely on an asset (such as a car, a home or a boat) that will be used as collateral for the loan.Unsecured loansUnsecured loans are more difficult to qualify for and have higher interest rates because an asset for collateral is not required. These are sometimes called personal loans.Variable rateVariable rate loans have an interest rate that changes based on market rates. Consumers payments will vary based on changing interest rates. They may end up paying more or less in interest based on the overall economic situation.Fixed rateFixed rate loans have an interest rate that remains the same for the entire life of the loan. The payments for these will remain the same, regardless of whether the market interest rate goes up or down.Home loansHome loans, or mortgages, are available to help people finance their homes. Conventional mortgages usually require the borrower to have a down payment for 20 percent of the purchase price.Car loansAuto loans are available for both new and used cars, and consumers can obtain car loans from banks and credit unions as well as most auto dealers.Business loansThose wishing to open a business or expand their current business can take out loans to finance their ventures.FHA loansMany private lenders work with the Federal Housing Authority to offer FHA mortgages. These loans require a much smaller down payment than conventional loans.Veterans Affairs loansArmed service veterans, current service members and their spouses may qualify for a Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgage. These home loans have a very low down payment, and borrowers aren’t required to purchase mortgage insurance.Who should take out a loan?
        	Top
        	House huntersIndividuals who rent should consider taking out a loan to purchase their own home if they have a stable income. Mortgage payments are often lower than rent, and owning their property allows them to build equity.Home ownersHomeowners who want to remodel or improve their house and those who want to lower their interest rate should consider refinancing their home.Small business ownersSmall business owners who want to expand their business should consider a small business loan.Credit card holdersAnyone carrying an outstanding balance on a high interest credit card should consider whether they could save money on interest by taking out an unsecured personal loan.DisclaimerInformation in this guide is general in nature and is intended for informational purposes only; it is not legal, health, investment or tax advice.

Date of Release: October 26, 2016
DBRS Assigns Ratings to Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-B


October 26, 2016







DBRS, Inc. (DBRS) has assigned ratings to the following notes issued by Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-B (Series 2016-B):

-- Series 2016-B Notes, Class II-A, rated A (sf)
-- Series 2016-B Notes, Class II-B, rated BBB (sf)

The Series 2016-B transaction is a warehouse for the financing of consumer loan receivables.

The ratings are based upon a review by DBRS of the following analytical considerations:
�	Transaction capital structure, proposed ratings and form and sufficiency of available credit enhancement.
�	The ability of the transaction to withstand stressed cash flow assumptions and repay investors according to the terms under which they have invested. For this transaction, the rating addresses the payment of timely interest on a monthly basis and principal by the stated legal maturity date. 
�	Lendmark Financial Services LLC�s (Lendmark) capabilities with regard to originations, underwriting and servicing.
�	The credit quality of the collateral and performance of Lendmark�s consumer loan portfolio. DBRS has used a hybrid approach in analyzing the Lendmark portfolio that incorporates elements of static pool analysis employed for assets, such as consumer loans and revolving asset analysis, employed for such assets as credit card master trusts.
�	DBRS applied a finance yield haircut of 6.00% for Class A and 4.00% for Class B. While these haircuts are lower than the range described in the �Rating U.S. Credit Card Asset-Backed Securities� methodology, the fixed-rate nature of the underlying loans, lack of interchange fees and historical yield consistency support these stressed assumptions.

      Fitch Rates Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-A
    





March 08, 2016 04:57 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns ratings to Lendmark Funding Trust 2016-A (LFT 
      2016-A) as follows:--$130,480,000 class A notes 'BBB+sf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$32,200,000 class B notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$15,042,000 
      class C notes 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Adequate Collateral Quality: The LFT 2016-A collateral pool comprises 
      secured and unsecured fixed rate personal loans and sales finance 
      contracts originated by the company based on its underwriting guidelines 
      (see Appendix A). The portfolio will also include renewed loans that 
      will replace or refinance the existing loan. Additional eligible loans 
      will be added to the portfolio during the revolving period ending Jan. 
      31, 2018.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization (OC) and excess spread. The initial OC of 
      approximately $22.6 million will be maintained for the life of the 
      transaction. Additionally, the class A notes will benefit from 
      subordination provided by the class B and C notes, and the class B notes 
      will benefit from subordination provided by the class C notes. In 
      addition, trust performance and other triggers based on credit and 
      servicing risks are used to provide additional protection for investors 
      should loan performance or certain counterparties' financial conditions 
      deteriorate (each an early amortization event). When an early 
      amortization event occurs, the revolving period will end and note 
      amortization will begin.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: A reserve account sized at $2 million which 
      equals 1% of the initial pool balance with a floor at 1% of the initial 
      pool balance, will be funded at closing.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Lendmark Financial Services LLC. 
      (Lendmark) will service 100% of the portfolio. Wells Fargo Bank N.A. 
      (Wells Fargo) is the back-up servicer and image file custodian. Fitch 
      considers all parties acceptable servicers. Wells Fargo in its capacity 
      of image file custodian will retain electronic copies of all imaged 
      files of each loan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      As Fitch's base case default proxy is derived primarily from historical 
      collateral performance, actual performance may differ from the expected 
      performance, resulting in higher loss levels than the base case. This 
      will result in a decline in available CE, and the remaining loss 
      coverage levels available to the notes and may make certain note ratings 
      susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in the coverage. Rating sensitivity results should 
      only be considered as one potential outcome, given that the transaction 
      is exposed to multiple dynamic risk factors. Rating sensitivity should 
      not be used as an indicator of future rating performance.
    

      Holding all other inputs constant, a 15% increase in base case defaults 
      resulted in a downgrade of at least three rating notches for the notes.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The 
      third-party due diligence focused on comparing the sample 
      characteristics provided in the data file of 47,103 consumer loans to 
      the corresponding information in the loan agreements. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have any 
      impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.
