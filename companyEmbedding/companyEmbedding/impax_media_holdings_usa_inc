A 21st century retailer-branded communications platform engaging grocery shoppers





Views this month so far: 






                    As featured in:                

































The network’s 32 inch high-definition screens mounted just above the product displays in every other checkout lane, create a dramatic “video wall” across the front end of the supermarket that can be seen by shoppers throughout the store.Retailer content drives the programming mix, including quick meal ideas and cooking tips, “What’s on Sale” spots, store services and community support.  Additional news and weather content is provided by Impax, and all content is retailer-branded.Content represents half of the program loop, with local and  national advertising, and advertiser branded content, representing the other half.  In recent testing, half of consumers felt that the screens improved their opinion of the retailer.Intriguing enough? Tell us what you are interested in:

Why do I need your screens?




The video wall will enhance the shopper experience by modernizing the look of your front end, driving impulse purchases before checkout, and entertaining your customers in the checkout line.

WAITING IN LINES

Waiting is the main reason customers get frustrated when they’re shopping…the screens cut perceived wait time.

TESTIMONIALS







                                            “We take pride in tailoring our product offerings and merchandising to the culture of the community where our store is located…Impax gives us the flexibility to customize the content on the network to local tastes.”

-- Jenny Jorge, GM of Compare Foods in Freeport, New York 






                                            “The ‘Key Foods Information Network’ that Impax Media created for us provides a turnkey solution to a digital video network at the front end of the store…the high definition ‘video wall’ that faces shoppers as they move through the store and enter the checkout lanes looks fantastic, and customers love seeing what’s on sale and great recipe ideas.”

-- Alex Guzman, owner of Key Foods in Valley Stream, New York 






                                            "We initially installed the Impax Media Digital Entertainment Gates in four of our stores 3 months ago.
The results have been really positive. Consumers find the content both relevant and engaging. In fact, we've recently given Impax the go ahead to install the Digital Entertainment Gates in all of our Metro locations in Greater Montreal.”


-- Benoit Gagnon, Director of Operations Groupe Messier 






                                            "I was sold on the idea right away. I find the system to be innovative, practical, and esthetically pleasing.”

- -Mario Paquette, owner, Pasquier Grocery (largest independent grocer in Quebec)

INSTALLATION IS FREE OF CHARGE






TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE ARE INCLUDED

Why advertise on your screens?




Ninety six percent of shoppers notice the screens, and they are an audience in a buying frame of mind…in a position to see your message for 13 minutes, a quarter of that in a “captive” checkout line.  All at one of the lowest cpm’s in the media industry, with proof of performance based on “Tru View“ technology that measures number of views electronically. 






















What are my benefits?





For local advertisers

A high percentage of people in your trade area visit a grocery store, multiple times per week…when they leave, they are directly on your path to purchase. 





For national advertisers selling grocery products

The ability to deliver your message steps away from a purchase decision…perfect for branded content or advertising. 





For any advertiser

High levels of engagement combined with low cost and proof of performance create a tremendous media value

On screen content






The on screen content in the four minute loop is a 50/50 split between retailer-branded messaging and advertising sold by Impax Media to advertisers. 




ON SALE
BRANDING
INFOTAINMENT
ADVERTISING








Ten second spots, using the store’s branding, that feature the top weekly deals and special offers, produced by Impax…consumers consider this to be the most desirable content. 










Fifteen to thirty second retailer-produced spots, featuring recipe ideas and cooking tips, store services (such as pharmacy, frequent shopper cards, apps, home delivery), employee of the month, or retailer's community activities. 










Twelve second spots, using the store’s branding…weather forecast, news, sports and entertainment, produced by Impax and updated hourly. 










Fifteen to thirty second advertiser messaging. This can be traditional advertising or an advertiser's branded content. 








How does "Tru View" technology work?




The screens have built-in sensors and use our proprietary TruView eye-tracking technology to collect and analyze viewing data. The screens recognize eye contact and activate a time-counter for each view, measuring the number of people who see your content and how long they spend watching it.The TruView technology also uses facial detection to measure datapoints on a face…these datapoints are compared to a database of facial characteristics to anonymously determine the approximate age and gender of the viewer.The TruView technology doesn’t affect privacy, because images are not recorded. The FCC and OTC have approved the use of this technology in a retail environment.

HAYWARD, Calif., Oct. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Impax Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:   IPXL) today announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Impax will acquire Tower Holdings, Inc., including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC, and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. (together, the "Companies") for $700 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. The privately-held Companies being acquired specialize in the development, manufacture and commercialization of complex generic and branded pharmaceutical products. The transaction will provide Impax with a highly-profitable and growing commercialized portfolio of products that are expected to generate full year 2014 revenues of approximately $215 million to $225 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $80 million to $85 million on a standalone basis. Assuming a close within the next six months, the transaction is expected to be approximately $0.90 accretive to Impax's 2015 earnings per diluted share.  
"This transaction is an important step forward in executing our plan to drive growth and create value through strategic acquisitions that enhance our existing strategies," said Fred Wilkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Impax. "The Companies will add a growing, highly profitable, commercial portfolio of generics as well as a lead product in a new brand franchise, which will enhance our brand division and enable us to utilize our brand commercial infrastructure more efficiently. The acquisition also adds a branded and generic pipeline that includes a number of near-term opportunities. In addition, Impax will gain an established campus in New Jersey focused on R&D, manufacturing, packaging and supply chain management. Further, this accretive transaction will move Impax to a more efficient capital structure, while also preserving our ability to pursue additional external strategic growth opportunities."
Christopher Worrell, Chief Executive Officer of Tower Holdings, Amedra and Lineage, said: "We are pleased with the progress we have made across our Companies with an emphasis on the successful implementation of a Quality Improvement Program, which resulted in recent product approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both Impax and the Companies have a proven record of developing high value specialty products, and we look forward to being a critical contributor to the future growth strategy and value creation for Impax."
"We look forward to working closely with the talented individuals from the Companies and leveraging the opportunities created by our combined organization," Wilkinson continued. "We believe that this strategic acquisition will further strengthen our dual business model in an effort to create value for our shareholders."
Transaction Benefits to Impax
This acquisition will provide Impax with important strategic and financial benefits, including:

A Portfolio of Growing, High-Margin Commercial Products: This highly-profitable portfolio consists of four branded products, including the branded Albenza® franchise, seven complimentary commercialized generic products, and an epinephrine auto-injector product. This portfolio, in combination with several products that the Companies plan to launch during the fourth quarter of 2014, are expected to generate 2014 revenues of approximately $215 million to $225 million and EBITDA of approximately $80 million to $85 million, with gross margins comparable to Impax's 2014 estimated gross margins. 
A Leading Franchise in a New Specialty Brand Therapeutic Area: Albenza is the leading treatment for invasive tapeworm infections. This niche product has attractive margins and a record of strong sales growth with well-developed lifecycle management strategies to support continued returns. The addition of this new therapeutic area will allow Impax to more efficiently utilize its brand commercial infrastructure and provide upside growth potential. 
A Generic Pipeline with Near-Term Opportunities: Impax will acquire 5 approved generic products not yet marketed, 11 applications pending approval, and more than 35 additional products in various stages of development. Impax will evaluate all these opportunities as part of its combined portfolio prioritization process. According to IMS Health (NSP), this pipeline of 50 plus products represents approximately $10.7 billion in U.S. brand and generic sales for the last 12 months ended August 2014. 
Diversifies and Expands Manufacturing, Packaging and Supply Chain Capabilities: The transaction will provide Impax with a DEA and FDA licensed manufacturing, packaging and warehousing campus in Middlesex, New Jersey, and will strengthen Impax's global Quality Improvement Program with the addition of the experienced team from the Companies. 
Financially Attractive with Operational Synergies: The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Impax's earnings per share after closing. Impax expects to achieve operational synergies of more than $10 million within the first year after the transaction closes. Savings are expected to come largely from research and development efficiencies, prioritization of the combined portfolio, and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Maintains Capital Efficiency, and Maintains Financial Strength and Flexibility: Impax intends to fund the acquisition through a combination of approximately $270 million of cash on hand and a new $430 million term loan pursuant to a commitment from Barclays. This financing combination will enable Impax to move towards a more efficient capital structure while also allowing the flexibility to continue to pursue strategic business development and merger and acquisition opportunities.
Approvals
The transaction is expected to close within the next six months, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals in the U.S. 
Advisors
Impax's financial advisor for this transaction is Barclays, and legal advisors are Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Latham & Watkins LLP and McDermott, Will & Emery LLP. Credit Suisse Securities LLC served as financial advisor to Tower Holdings, Inc. and RoundTable Healthcare Partners LLC, and Sidley Austin LLP served as legal advisor.

Impax will host a conference call with financial analysts to discuss the transaction today at 8:30 a.m. ET. The conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 356-3814 for U.S. callers and (706) 758-0033 for international callers. The conference call ID number is 18670463.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains forward-looking EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is adjusted to exclude, among other things, the impact of interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and income tax expense or benefit. These items are excluded from EBITDA because they are generally outside the normal operations of a company. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures, as they are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is not feasible to provide reconciliation to the most comparable projected U.S. GAAP measure because the excluded items are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events.
"Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:
To the extent any statements made in this news release contain information that is not historical; these statements are forward-looking in nature and express the beliefs and expectations of management. Such statements are based on current expectations and involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's future results, performance, or achievements to differ significantly from the results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in revenues and operating income; the Company's ability to promptly correct the issues raised in the warning letter and Form 483 observations received from the FDA; the Company's ability to successfully develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products in a timely manner; the Company's ability to sustain profitability and positive cash flows; any delays or unanticipated expenses in connection with the operation of the Company's manufacturing facilities; the uncertainty of patent litigation and other legal proceedings; the Company's ability to manage growth, including through potential acquisitions; the parties' ability to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion of the transaction with the CorePharma companies; the parties' ability to consummate the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction, including the receipt of the regulatory approvals required for the transaction not being obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule; the integration of the acquired business by the Company being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) being greater than expected following the transaction; the retention of certain key employees of the acquired business being difficult; the Company's and the acquired business's expected or targeted future financial and operating performance and results; the combined company's capacity to bring new products to market; and the possibility that Company may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with the transaction within the expected time-frames or at all and to successfully integrate the acquired business; and other risks described in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date on which they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, regardless of whether new information becomes available, future developments occur or otherwise.

HAYWARD, Calif., Oct. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Impax Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IPXL) today announced the execution of a definitive agreement under which Impax will acquire Tower Holdings, Inc., including operating subsidiaries CorePharma LLC and Amedra Pharmaceuticals LLC, and Lineage Therapeutics Inc. (together, the "Companies") for $700 million in cash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. The privately-held Companies being acquired specialize in the development, manufacture and commercialization of complex generic and branded pharmaceutical products. The transaction will provide Impax with a highly-profitable and growing commercialized portfolio of products that are expected to generate full year 2014 revenues of approximately $215 million to $225 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $80 million to $85 million on a standalone basis. Assuming a close within the next six months, the transaction is expected to be approximately $0.90 accretive to Impax's 2015 earnings per diluted share.  
"This transaction is an important step forward in executing our plan to drive growth and create value through strategic acquisitions that enhance our existing strategies," said Fred Wilkinson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Impax. "The Companies will add a growing, highly profitable, commercial portfolio of generics as well as a lead product in a new brand franchise, which will enhance our brand division and enable us to utilize our brand commercial infrastructure more efficiently. The acquisition also adds a branded and generic pipeline that includes a number of near-term opportunities. In addition, Impax will gain an established campus in New Jersey focused on R&D, manufacturing, packaging and supply chain management. Further, this accretive transaction will move Impax to a more efficient capital structure, while also preserving our ability to pursue additional external strategic growth opportunities."
Christopher Worrell, Chief Executive Officer of Tower Holdings, Amedra and Lineage, said: "We are pleased with the progress we have made across our Companies with an emphasis on the successful implementation of a Quality Improvement Program, which resulted in recent product approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both Impax and the Companies have a proven record of developing high value specialty products, and we look forward to being a critical contributor to the future growth strategy and value creation for Impax."
"We look forward to working closely with the talented individuals from the Companies and leveraging the opportunities created by our combined organization," Wilkinson continued. "We believe that this strategic acquisition will further strengthen our dual business model in an effort to create value for our shareholders."
Transaction Benefits to ImpaxThis acquisition will provide Impax with important strategic and financial benefits, including:

A Portfolio of Growing, High-Margin Commercial Products: This highly-profitable portfolio consists of four branded products, including the branded Albenza® franchise, seven complimentary commercialized generic products, and an epinephrine auto-injector product. This portfolio, in combination with several products that the Companies plan to launch during the fourth quarter of 2014, are expected to generate 2014 revenues of approximately $215 million to $225 million and EBITDA of approximately $80 million to $85 million, with gross margins comparable to Impax's 2014 estimated gross margins. 
A Leading Franchise in a New Specialty Brand Therapeutic Area: Albenza is the leading treatment for invasive tapeworm infections. This niche product has attractive margins and a record of strong sales growth with well-developed lifecycle management strategies to support continued returns. The addition of this new therapeutic area will allow Impax to more efficiently utilize its brand commercial infrastructure and provide upside growth potential. 
A Generic Pipeline with Near-Term Opportunities: Impax will acquire 5 approved generic products not yet marketed, 11 applications pending approval, and more than 35 additional products in various stages of development. Impax will evaluate all these opportunities as part of its combined portfolio prioritization process. According to IMS Health (NSP), this pipeline of 50 plus products represents approximately $10.7 billion in U.S. brand and generic sales for the last 12 months ended August 2014. 
Diversifies and Expands Manufacturing, Packaging and Supply Chain Capabilities: The transaction will provide Impax with a DEA and FDA licensed manufacturing, packaging and warehousing campus in Middlesex, New Jersey, and will strengthen Impax's global Quality Improvement Program with the addition of the experienced team from the Companies. 
Financially Attractive with Operational Synergies: The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Impax's earnings per share after closing. Impax expects to achieve operational synergies of more than $10 million within the first year after the transaction closes. Savings are expected to come largely from research and development efficiencies, prioritization of the combined portfolio, and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Maintains Capital Efficiency, and Maintains Financial Strength and Flexibility: Impax intends to fund the acquisition through a combination of approximately $270 million of cash on hand and a new $430 million term loan pursuant to a commitment from Barclays. This financing combination will enable Impax to move towards a more efficient capital structure while also allowing the flexibility to continue to pursue strategic business development and merger and acquisition opportunities.
ApprovalsThe transaction is expected to close within the next six months, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals in the U.S. 
AdvisorsImpax's financial advisor for this transaction is Barclays, and legal advisors are Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Latham & Watkins LLP and McDermott, Will & Emery LLP. Credit Suisse Securities LLC served as financial advisor to Tower Holdings, Inc. and RoundTable Healthcare Partners LLC, and Sidley Austin LLP served as legal advisor.

The conference call may be accessed by dialing (877) 356-3814 for U.S. callers and (706) 758-0033 for international callers. The conference call ID number is 18670463.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release contains forward-looking EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is adjusted to exclude, among other things, the impact of interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and income tax expense or benefit. These items are excluded from EBITDA because they are generally outside the normal operations of a company. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures, as they are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is not feasible to provide reconciliation to the most comparable projected U.S. GAAP measure because the excluded items are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events.

Impax Pharmaceuticals Announce FDA Approval of RYTARY™ (Carbidopa and Levodopa) Extended-Release Capsules for the Treatment of Parkinson's disease


01/08/2015

Download this Press Release ()


HAYWARD, Calif., Jan. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Impax Pharmaceuticals, a division of Impax Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IPXL), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RYTARY, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and / or manganese intoxication. RYTARY is not for use in patients using nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO) inhibitors.
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140402/PH96035LOGO 
"The FDA approval of RYTARY (pronounced rye-TAR-ee) is an important new development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and provides an extended-release carbidopa-levodopa product that treats Parkinson's disease," said
Fred Wilkinson
, president and CEO, Impax Laboratories. "RYTARY is designed to address one of the most significant unmet needs for patients living with Parkinson's disease, which is to reduce the amount of time during the day when their symptoms are not adequately controlled."  
"There are approximately one million Americans living with this chronic disease and we are pleased to offer this new therapy as a treatment option for those patients," added Wilkinson. "Today's approval of RYTARY is also a significant milestone for Impax because it is our first branded drug internally developed and approved for commercialization."
RYTARY contains immediate release and extended-release beads, with a specific amount of carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio, and provides both initial and extended levodopa plasma concentrations after a single dose. RYTARY may be swallowed whole or, for patients who have trouble swallowing, the capsule may be opened and the beads sprinkled on applesauce and consumed immediately.
Impax expects the four strengths of RYTARY, 23.75mg/95mg, 36.25mg/145mg, 48.75mg/195mg, and 61.25mg/245mg (carbidopa/levodopa) to be available for commercial distribution in February 2015.
The RYTARY clinical program studied patients with early (levodopa-naive) to advanced Parkinson's disease in the U.S. and in Europe. In APEX-PD (Study 1), a trial that enrolled and randomized 381 levodopa-naive patients, the study met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in the sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (activities of daily living) score and UPDRS Part III (motor skills) score for RYTARY versus placebo at Week 30 (or early termination). 
In ADVANCE-PD (Study 2), a trial of 393 randomized patients with advanced Parkinson's disease having "off" time, the results showed treatment with RYTARY reduced the percentage of "off" time (36.9% to 23.8%) from baseline versus immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (36.0% to 29.8%) during waking hours to end of study. RYTARY also increased "on" time without troublesome dyskinesia during waking hours versus baseline to end of study by 1.8 hours. Less "off" time was primary related to more "on" time without troublesome dyskinesia. 
The most common adverse reactions with RYTARY in the APEX-PD trial (in at least 5% of patients and more frequently than in placebo) were nausea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams, dry mouth, dyskinesia, anxiety, constipation, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension. The most common adverse reactions with RYTARY in the ADVANCE-PD trial (in at least 5% of patients and more frequently than an oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa) were nausea and headache.
About Parkinson's disease
Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting approximately one million people in the U.S., with 50,000-60,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. There is currently no known cure for Parkinson's.
About RYTARY
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

RYTARY is contraindicated in patients who are currently taking or have recently (within 2 weeks) taken a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (e.g., phenelzine and tranylcypromine). Hypertension can occur if these drugs are used concurrently. 
Patients treated with levodopa (a component of RYTARY) have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on levodopa, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack), such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Before initiating treatment with RYTARY, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with RYTARY such as concomitant sedating medications or the presence of a sleep disorder. Prescribers should consider discontinuing RYTARY in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.). If a decision is made to continue RYTARY, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. 
A symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking RYTARY. If the decision is made to discontinue RYTARY, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion. 
Cardiovascular ischemic events have occurred in patients taking RYTARY. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac function should be monitored in an intensive cardiac care facility during the period of initial dosage adjustment. 
There is an increased risk for hallucinations and psychosis in patients taking RYTARY. Hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa. Hallucinations may be accompanied by confusion and sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming. Abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.  
    Because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with RYTARY. In addition, medications that antagonize the effects of dopamine used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of RYTARY. 
Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including RYTARY, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with RYTARY. Consider a dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking RYTARY. 
RYTARY can cause dyskinesias that may require a dosage reduction of RYTARY or other medications used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.  
Treatment with RYTARY may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer and may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma.  
RYTARY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Caution should be exercised when RYTARY is administered to a nursing woman.

Overdosage

The acute symptoms of levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor overdosage can be expected to arise from dopaminergic overstimulation (cardiovascular and CNS disturbances).

Drug Interactions:  

Monitor patients taking selective MAO-B inhibitors and carbidopa-levodopa. The combination may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. RYTARY should be co-administered cautiously with: dopamine D2 antagonists (metoclopramide), isoniazid, and iron salts. 
RYTARY should not be chewed, divided, or crushed.
