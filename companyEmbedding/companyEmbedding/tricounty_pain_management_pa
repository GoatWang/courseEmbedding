(800)-319-3118
















 
PT & REHABILITATION
Physical therapy is a vital component of a comprehensive  pain management program. It addresses the  physical side of inflammation, stiffness, and soreness through exercise,  manipulation, and massage. These  techniques work together to help the body heal itself by stimulating the production  of natural pain relieving chemicals.                    
It is important for patients to understand physical  inactivity increases the risk for chronic pain. The less you move, the more pain you’ll most likely experience. A highly trained physical therapist will  work in conjunction with our pain specialists to design a therapy regimen focused on  restoring the physical ability of a patient, allowing them to gain functionality back into  their everyday life. 
Facts about Physical Therapy
The following list contains a few of the most common ailments PT can treat:

Neuromusculoskeltal pain and dysfunction
Neck & Back pain and dysfunction
Pelvic pain and dysfunction
Upper extremity pain and dysfunction 
Lower extremity pain and dysfunction 
Jaw pain and headache



Goals of  Physical Therapy:

Relieve pain and discomfort
Decrease Impairment and dysfunction
Improve or maintain function
Prevent or minimize disability
Educate the patient to be effective in self management

Specialties





Pain Management







    A pain management specialist is a physician with advanced knowledge and training in diagnosing and treating pain. These doctors do not come from one particular discipline, but rather use their respective backgrounds to contribute a varied approach to the field of pain management.


    These specialists use their different skills and training in pain management to treat pain stemming from different causes - whether it's neuropathic pain or headache, or the result of injury, a surgical procedure, cancer or another illness.


    Pain management specialists are primarily trained as anesthesiologists, physiatrists, interventional radiologists, neurologists, osteopaths, or primary care physicians.

Information about group practices



What is a Group Practice?

                According to The Medical Group Management Association, a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities, expenses, profits and other resources like support staff and equipment.
            

                Group practices tend to fall into two categories: those  that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like East Boston Neighborhood Health that specializes in internal medicine.
            

Why Group Practice?

                As medicine became more complex in the twentieth century, the need for group practices made more sense. Physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape. In addition, the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services, such as tests and X-rays, in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner. Hence, doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients.
            

Benefits of Group Practice


                    Access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice
                

                    Better coverage on weekends and off-hours
                

                    One-stop clinics for comprehensive care and testing

Involving specialized procedures to treat and manage chronic pain, pain management is an area of specialty that helps patients who suffer ongoing discomfort from conditions and disorders such as chronic low back pain, neck pain, complex regional pain syndrome, or muscle and bone pain.
The practice of pain management uses an array of treatment methods for chronic pain, because the pain experienced can vary from mild to excruciating, episodic to continuous, and be inconvenient to completely incapacitating.
At Tri-County Orthopedics, our pain management doctor understands that chronic pain forces you to live an adjusted lifestyle. Our pain management specialist will work with you to assess your condition and develop a treatment plan specific to your needs.
To consult with one of our pain management doctors, please request an appointment online, or call (973) 538-2334.
Why Choose Tri-County Orthopedics?

Committed to developing customized treatment plans to accommodate each patient, our pain management specialist has the knowledge, proficiency, and skill to effectively treat your condition individually to your needs.
