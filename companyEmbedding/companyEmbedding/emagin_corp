EMagin Announces New Products For The Consumer Market






Business Wire




Nov 11, 2016 7:00 AM EST













 




























































  eMagin Corporation, or the "Company" (NYSE MKT: EMAN), a leader in the development, design and manufacture of Active Matrix OLED microdisplays for high resolution imaging products, today announced the launch of two new products: BlazeSpark TM and BlazeTorch TM , innovative and affordable night vision products for the consumer marketplace.  "eMagin is bringing military quality, high resolution night vision to the mass market," said Andrew G. Sculley, President and CEO of eMagin. "Our products, BlazeSpark and BlazeTorch, were designed with the sports enthusiast in mind. With the superior night infrared technology and other features of the products, we expect them to be equally attractive to law enforcement, first responders, utility companies and others who work at night. Importantly, we are launching these new products at disruptive price points compared to existing products on the market. As such, we believe eMagin has the capability to significantly expand the market for these applications.  "We are also are excited to have been named a 2017 Consumer Electronics Show ("CES") Innovation Award Honoree in the Digital Imaging product category for BlazeSpark. This prestigious award was presented last night at the CES Awards Banquet in New York City in advance of the CES show in Las Vegas next January where we will be an exhibitor. Both products will be sold through our website www.blazethenight.com as well as through specialty partner channels."  The BlazeSpark product is a handheld smartphone attachment that allows consumers to see clear, high-resolution images in the dark by inserting their smartphone into a revolutionary  case that will display what the night vision sensor is seeing. A companion app allows users to record, chat, and live stream content within the BlazeSpark network or to other social media sites and share their experience worldwide. The suggested retail price will be below $300.  The BlazeTorch product is a wearable device that utilize eMagin's advanced OLED microdisplay technology to provide hands-free operation during night-time activities with the capability to record and upload content. Video can be uploaded to www.blazethenight.com as well as shared with others on social media sites. The suggested retail price for the wearable headset will be below $1,000.  "We have established the supply chain and built inventory for the initial launch. We anticipate ramping up production for expanded distribution during the first quarter of 2017. We expect a modest contribution to revenues in 2016 and look for a more meaningful contribution in 2017 as volumes increase," continued Mr. Sculley.

					Full Description



eMagin Corporation (eMagin), incorporated on November 30, 1993, is engaged in the manufacture of microdisplays using organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets OLED on silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilizes OLED microdisplays and related products. The Company also performs research in the OLED field. The Company's virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce microdisplays smaller than one-inch diagonally, which when viewed through a magnifier, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. The Company's products enable its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers to develop and market electronic products, especially products that are mobile and portable. Using the Company's active matrix OLED technology, various computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplay silicon backplane. The Company offers its products to OEMs and other buyers as both separate components, integrated bundles coupled with its own optics, or full systems. The Company also offers engineering support to enable customers to integrate its products into their product development programs and design of customized displays with resolutions or features to meet special customer requirements.SVGA+OLED Microdisplay SeriesThe Company's SVGA+OLED Microdisplay Series is approximately 0.62 inch diagonal microdisplay, which has a resolution of 852x600 triad pixels (over 1.53 million picture elements). The display also has an internal National Television System Committee (NTSC) monochrome video decoder for low power night vision systems. SVGA+ Rev3 OLED-XL microdisplay is an OLED display solution for near-eye personal viewer applications that uses approximately 115 megawatt power in monochrome for thermal imaging applications, and over 175 megawatt for full color video.Digital SVGA OLED-XLThe Company's Digital SVGA or DSVGA OLED-XL is an 800 x 600 display with over 15 micron pixels and approximately 0.6 inch diagonal. Digital SVGA features a digital composite signal interface for color applications.SXGA096 OLED-XL/XLSThe Company's SXGA096 OLED-XL/XLS features approximately 9.6-micron color pixel and is designed with the same level of feature integration as the DSVGA microdisplay, as well as low voltage differential signaling (LDVS) data interface. SXGA096 OLED-XL/XLS offers small form factor applications, such as commercial headsets and smart weapon sights.SXGA OLED-XLThe Company's SXGA OLED microdisplay with approximately 0.77 inch diagonal active area provides over 3,932,160 sub-pixels in an active area. The display's triad pixel array comprises triads of vertical sub-pixels stacked side by side to make up each 12 x 12 millimeter color pixel. The SXGA OLED-XL microdisplay offers digital signal processing, requiring over 200 megawatt under typical operation. The supported video formats are SXGA, 720p, DVGA (through 1280 x 960 pixel doubling), and both frame sequential and field sequential stereovision.VGA OLED-XLThe Company's VGA OLED-XL is over 0.5 inches and low powered microdisplay. VGA OLED-XL utilizes the same voltage pixel drive architecture and Deep Black technology as the SXGA and WUXGA designs and includes motion artifact reduction technology similar to WUXGA. Similar to SXGA and WUXGA, the VGA provides a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) driver design for flexibility and versatility.WUXGA OLED-XLThe Company's WUXGA OLED-XL has a triad sub-pixel structure, which is built of over 7,138,360 active dots at approximately 3.2 microns each. The WUXGA design features its Deep Black architecture that ensures that off-pixels are truly black optimizing contrast under all conditions and delivers pixel to pixel uniformity. The WUXGA OLED-XL includes a LVDS serial interface and the overall display power requirement is typically approximately 350 megawatt running standard video. Also included is its motion enhancement technology, which helps in video display and virtually eliminates unwanted artifacts. Similar to SXGA, the WUXGA provides a FPGA driver design available on a separate, lower power driver board, or as source code for integration into end product electronics for OEM developers.Lens and Design Reference KitsThe Company offers a WF05 prism optic, with mounting brackets or combined with OLED microdisplays to form an optic-display module. It provides Design Reference Kits, which include a microdisplay and associated electronics to help OEMs evaluate its microdisplay products and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating its microdisplays.Integrated ModulesThe Company provides near-eye virtual imaging modules. Its near-eye virtual imaging modules incorporate its OLED-on-silicon microdisplays with its lenses and electronic interfaces for integration into OEM products.The Company competes with Yunnan OLiGHTECK Opto-Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., MicroOLED, Global OLED Technology LLC., Sony Mobile Display Corp and Universal Display Corporation.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
