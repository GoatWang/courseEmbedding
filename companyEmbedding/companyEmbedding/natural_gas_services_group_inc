 History of NGSG

Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGSG) was incorporated in 1998 and initially operated as a holding company of Flare King, Hi-Tech Compression, NGE Leasing, Inc., and CNG Engines Company. In 2000, Flare King and Hi-Tech merged to form Rotary Gas Systems, Inc. (RGS) to focus on rotary screw compressor and flare system rental and sales. CNG was sold to an independent buyer.
In 2001, NGSG acquired Great Lakes Compression, Inc. (GLC), including all of the compression related assets of Dominion Michigan Petroleum Services, Inc.
In 2002, NGSG became a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX Symbol NGS).
On January 3, 2005, NGSG purchased Screw Compression Systems, Inc. (SCS), a packager of highly engineered rotary screw and reciprocating compression equipment and owner of the proprietary Cylinders in Plane (CiP) reciprocating compression product line.
Today, we operate under the corporate heading of Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGSG) including our engineered products subsidiary, SCS, our GLC division, and our Flare King and CiP product lines.

 Products & Services >> Compressor Rebuild & Exchange

Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGSG) offers a unique opportunity to minimize costs and maximize revenues through our "exchange and rebuild program" designed specifically for exchange and rebuild of rotary screw compressors where downtime and lost revenues are critical. Along with our exclusive distributor arrangements with Frick and ELGI, we are also a factory authorized rebuild center for LeRoi. In addition, we rebuild and exchange all other brands and only use OEM parts.

The NGSG rebuild and exchange program is based on fundamental "predictive maintenance" practices and requires coordination between out customer and the NGSG service team. The primary goal is to maintain a periodic exchange cycle to minimize excessive rebuild costs and to prolong the operational life of the compressor.
Whether an exchange and rebuild is planned or associated with an emergency failure, NGSG will respond aggressively to provide a new or rebuilt compressor to minimize your downtime.

Natural Gas Services Group, Inc.  Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial and Operating Results



 MIDLAND, Texas May 4, 2017 - Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. ("NGS" or the "Company") (NYSE:NGS), a leading provider of gas compression equipment and services to the energy industry, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, NGS reported revenue of $18.9 million, compared to $21.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and $16.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Revenue increased $2.2 million, or 13.2% sequentially and declined 12.4% when compared to the year ago quarter. The Company reported net income for the quarter of $252,000 which compares to $2.5 million in the year ago quarter and $1.2 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2016.  Earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $0.02. Included in the net income calculation is incremental stock compensation expense of $934,000 (pre-tax), related to the expensing of certain unvested stock grants that are required to be expensed under the terms of the Company's Stock Compensation plan. Highlights of the quarter include: Revenue: Total revenue was $18.9 million, a decrease from $21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period ended March 31, 2016. This change was mainly attributable to a decrease in rental revenue due to reduced rental utilization, competitive pricing pressure and generally lower activity in the upstream oil and gas industry because of lower commodity prices. Total revenue increased between consecutive quarters by $2.2 million to $18.9 million from $16.7 million, due to an increase in compressor sales. Operating Income: Operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $343,000, compared to the prior year's first quarter of $3.8 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in rental revenue, adjusted gross margins and an increase in stock compensation expense. Sequentially, operating income decreased to $343,000 from $967,000 due to a decrease in adjusted gross margins and an increase in stock compensation expense. Adjusted Gross Margins: Total adjusted gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $3.1 million to $8.7 million from $11.8 million for the same period ended March 31, 2016. Total adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 46% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 55% for the same period ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was the result of a mix shift from higher margin rentals to lower margin sales. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin was $8.7 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017 compared to $9.1 million in the three months ended in December 31, 2016. Adjusted gross margin percentages decreased to 46% from 55% the previous quarter, driven primarily by lower adjusted gross margins on rentals. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin at the conclusion of this release. Net Income:  Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to $252,000 compared to net income of $2.5 million for the same period in 2016. Sequentially, net income decreased to $252,000 from $1.2 million. Earnings Per Share:  Comparing the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016, earnings per diluted share was $0.02 cents down from $0.20 cents. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.02 cents from $0.09 cents between sequential quarters. Adjusted EBITDA:  Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.6 million to $5.7 million or 30% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus $9.3 million or 43% of revenue for the same three months ended March 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately $1.3 million in the sequential quarters and decreased relative to revenue to 30% from 42%. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA at the conclusion of this release. Cash Flow: At March 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $74.4 million with a bank debt level of $417,000, all of which was classified as current. Positive net cash flow from operating activities was $10.8 million during the three months ended 2017.  Commenting on first quarter 2017 results, Stephen C. Taylor, President and CEO, said: "NGS had a good first quarter. Our rental utilization held relatively steady and our sales activity remained strong. While we did have a significant increase in SG&A expense due to non-cash costs related to the expensing of certain unvested stock grants, our operating performance was better than expected. As noted in the past, we anticipate utilization and pricing pressure through the first half of this year but anticipate some relief in the back half. Cash generation is strong, debt is minimal and we continue to be positioned very well." Selected data: The table below shows revenues and percentage of total revenues, along with our adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, and related percentages of each of our product lines for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Adjusted gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.          Revenue       Adjusted Gross Margin(1)         Three months ended March 31,       Three months ended March 31,         2017       2016       2017       2016         (in thousands)     Rental   $   11,922           63   %       $   16,408           76   %       $   7,254           61   %       $   10,714           65   %     Sales   6,637           35   %       4,910           23   %       1,214           18   %       978           20   %     Service & Maintenance   343           2   %       258           1   %       249           73   %       147           57   %     Total   $   18,902                   $   21,576                   $   8,717           46   %       $   11,839           55   %      (1) For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read "Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin" below. Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Gross Margin: "Adjusted Gross Margin" is defined as total revenue less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). Adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), which are key operating components. Depreciation expense is a necessary element of costs and the ability to generate revenue and selling, general and administrative expense is a necessary cost to support operations and required corporate activities. Management uses this non-GAAP measure as a supplemental measure to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the company's performance. As an indicator of operating performance, adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner. The reconciliation of operating income to adjusted gross margin is as follows:          Three months ended March 31,             (in thousands)             2017       2016     Operating Income   $   343           $   3,767         Depreciation and amortization   5,328           5,503         Selling, general, and administration expenses   3,046           2,569         Adjusted Gross Margin   $   8,717           $   11,839          Non GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA: "Adjusted EBITDA" reflects net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by analysts and investors as an indicator of operating cash flow since it excludes the impact of movements in working capital items, non-cash charges and financing costs. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA gives the investor information as to the cash generated from the operations of a business. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures of performance. Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by NGS may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as calculated and reported by other companies. The most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and gross margin is as follows:          Three months ended March 31,         (in thousands)         2017       2016     Net income   $   252           $   2,541         Interest expense   2           2         Provision for income taxes   92           1,243         Depreciation and amortization   5,328           5,503         Adjusted EBITDA   5,674           9,289            Conference Call Details: Teleconference: Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. Central (11:00 a.m. Eastern).  Live via phone by dialing 877-358-7306, pass code "Natural Gas Services".   All attendees and participants to the conference call should arrange to call in at least 5 minutes prior to the start time.

Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. 
                Natural Gas Services Group, Inc.  Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial and Operating Results



 MIDLAND, Texas May 4, 2017 - Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. ("NGS" or the "Company") (NYSE:NGS), a leading provider of gas compression equipment and services to the energy industry, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, NGS reported revenue of $18.9 million, compared to $21.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and $16.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Revenue increased $2.2 million, or 13.2% sequentially and declined 12.4% when compared to the year ago quarter. The Company reported net income for the quarter of $252,000 which compares to $2.5 million in the year ago quarter and $1.2 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2016.  Earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $0.02. Included in the net income calculation is incremental stock compensation expense of $934,000 (pre-tax), related to the expensing of certain unvested stock grants that are required to be expensed under the terms of the Company's Stock Compensation plan. Highlights of the quarter include: Revenue: Total revenue was $18.9 million, a decrease from $21.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period ended March 31, 2016. This change was mainly attributable to a decrease in rental revenue due to reduced rental utilization, competitive pricing pressure and generally lower activity in the upstream oil and gas industry because of lower commodity prices. Total revenue increased between consecutive quarters by $2.2 million to $18.9 million from $16.7 million, due to an increase in compressor sales. Operating Income: Operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $343,000, compared to the prior year's first quarter of $3.8 million. This decrease was due to a reduction in rental revenue, adjusted gross margins and an increase in stock compensation expense. Sequentially, operating income decreased to $343,000 from $967,000 due to a decrease in adjusted gross margins and an increase in stock compensation expense. Adjusted Gross Margins: Total adjusted gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $3.1 million to $8.7 million from $11.8 million for the same period ended March 31, 2016. Total adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 46% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 55% for the same period ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was the result of a mix shift from higher margin rentals to lower margin sales. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin was $8.7 million for the three months ending March 31, 2017 compared to $9.1 million in the three months ended in December 31, 2016. Adjusted gross margin percentages decreased to 46% from 55% the previous quarter, driven primarily by lower adjusted gross margins on rentals. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin at the conclusion of this release. Net Income:  Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to $252,000 compared to net income of $2.5 million for the same period in 2016. Sequentially, net income decreased to $252,000 from $1.2 million. Earnings Per Share:  Comparing the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016, earnings per diluted share was $0.02 cents down from $0.20 cents. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.02 cents from $0.09 cents between sequential quarters. Adjusted EBITDA:  Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.6 million to $5.7 million or 30% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus $9.3 million or 43% of revenue for the same three months ended March 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately $1.3 million in the sequential quarters and decreased relative to revenue to 30% from 42%. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA at the conclusion of this release. Cash Flow: At March 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $74.4 million with a bank debt level of $417,000, all of which was classified as current. Positive net cash flow from operating activities was $10.8 million during the three months ended 2017.  Commenting on first quarter 2017 results, Stephen C. Taylor, President and CEO, said: "NGS had a good first quarter. Our rental utilization held relatively steady and our sales activity remained strong. While we did have a significant increase in SG&A expense due to non-cash costs related to the expensing of certain unvested stock grants, our operating performance was better than expected. As noted in the past, we anticipate utilization and pricing pressure through the first half of this year but anticipate some relief in the back half. Cash generation is strong, debt is minimal and we continue to be positioned very well." Selected data: The table below shows revenues and percentage of total revenues, along with our adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, and related percentages of each of our product lines for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Adjusted gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.          Revenue       Adjusted Gross Margin(1)         Three months ended March 31,       Three months ended March 31,         2017       2016       2017       2016         (in thousands)     Rental   $   11,922           63   %       $   16,408           76   %       $   7,254           61   %       $   10,714           65   %     Sales   6,637           35   %       4,910           23   %       1,214           18   %       978           20   %     Service & Maintenance   343           2   %       258           1   %       249           73   %       147           57   %     Total   $   18,902                   $   21,576                   $   8,717           46   %       $   11,839           55   %      (1) For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read "Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin" below. Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Gross Margin: "Adjusted Gross Margin" is defined as total revenue less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). Adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), which are key operating components. Depreciation expense is a necessary element of costs and the ability to generate revenue and selling, general and administrative expense is a necessary cost to support operations and required corporate activities. Management uses this non-GAAP measure as a supplemental measure to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the company's performance. As an indicator of operating performance, adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner. The reconciliation of operating income to adjusted gross margin is as follows:          Three months ended March 31,             (in thousands)             2017       2016     Operating Income   $   343           $   3,767         Depreciation and amortization   5,328           5,503         Selling, general, and administration expenses   3,046           2,569         Adjusted Gross Margin   $   8,717           $   11,839          Non GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA: "Adjusted EBITDA" reflects net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by analysts and investors as an indicator of operating cash flow since it excludes the impact of movements in working capital items, non-cash charges and financing costs. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA gives the investor information as to the cash generated from the operations of a business. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures of performance. Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by NGS may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as calculated and reported by other companies. The most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and gross margin is as follows:          Three months ended March 31,         (in thousands)         2017       2016     Net income   $   252           $   2,541         Interest expense   2           2         Provision for income taxes   92           1,243         Depreciation and amortization   5,328           5,503         Adjusted EBITDA   5,674           9,289            Conference Call Details: Teleconference: Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. Central (11:00 a.m. Eastern).  Live via phone by dialing 877-358-7306, pass code "Natural Gas Services".   All attendees and participants to the conference call should arrange to call in at least 5 minutes prior to the start time.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          NEWSMarch 9, 2017NYSE: NGS Exhibit 99  NGS Reports Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings of 9 cents per diluted shareFull Year 2016 Earnings of 50 cents per diluted shareMIDLAND, Texas March 9, 2017 - Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:NGS), a leading provider of gas compression equipment and services to the natural gas and oil industry, announces its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. Financial results contained herein are preliminary and subject to the audited consolidated financial statements included in NGS's Form 10-K to be filed on or about March 10, 2017.Revenue: Total revenue decreased to $16.7 million from $25.8 million, or 35%, for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period ended December 31, 2015. This change was attributable to a decrease in rental revenue related to reduced activity in the upstream oil and natural gas industry due to low commodity prices. Total revenue increased between consecutive quarters by approximately $525,000 or 3.2%, to $16.7 million from $16.2 million, primarily due to an increase in compressor unit sales. Total revenue decreased to $71.7 million from $95.9 million, or 25.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This was primarily the result of a 25.8% decrease in rental revenue and a 26.4% decrease in sales revenue. The revenue decrease is due to reduced customer demand, resulting from the drop in oil prices. Operating Income: Operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $967,000, compared to the comparative prior year's level of $4.6 million. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues, a high level of relatively fixed depreciation expense and charges related to the retirement of some rental fleet assets and inventory adjustments. Sequentially, operating income decreased to $967,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 from $1.8  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in rental gross margins between the periods and our rental equipment retirement and inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8.4 million, down 44% compared to last year's comparative period, primarily due to a decrease in rental revenue. Adjusted Gross Margins: Total adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, decreased $3.9 million to $9.1 million from $13.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2015. Overall adjusted gross margin percentage increased to 55% from 51% for this same comparative period. This increase was the result of higher margins in our total sales. Sequentially, total adjusted gross margin decreased to $9.1 million from $9.4 million due to lower margins on our rentals in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016. For the comparative year ended periods, adjusted gross margins decreased from prior year to $39.8 million from $53.3 million and remained steady at 55.5% of revenue. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin, below.Net Income: Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 decreased to $1.2 million compared to net income of $3.3 million for the same period in 2015. Sequentially, net income decreased to $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 from $1.5 million. In the comparative year ended periods, net income decreased by $3.7 million to $6.5 million. Net income in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by research and development and domestic production tax adjustments.Earnings per share: Comparing fourth quarter 2016 versus the same quarter 2015, earnings per diluted share was 9 cents down from 26 cents. Sequentially, diluted earnings per share decreased to 9 cents in the fourth quarter of 2016, down from 12 cents. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.2 million to $7.0 million or 42% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $10.2 million or 40% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $300,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the sequential quarter. As a percentage of revenue for the same comparative period Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 42% from 45%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 27% to $30.8 million or 43% of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA, below.1

ngs_10k_2017-03-10_46_114Financial - ExpenseThe decrease in depreciation expense is driven by the 258 units we retired in 2015 that had a net book value of $5.3 million, which was slightly offset by the full year of deprecation recognized on the 52 units added to our rental fleet in 2015 and the 18 units we added in 2016.
ngs_10k_2017-03-10_45_112Other - OtherThis 18.0% decrease is primarily a result in a reduction in stock compensation of $1.0 million due to moving from a one year vesting period to a two vesting period for our 2016 restricted stock awards to our executive officers and a decrease in the executive incentive cash bonus of $400,000.
ngs_10k_2017-03-10_25_71Financial - ExpenseTo the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of operations.
