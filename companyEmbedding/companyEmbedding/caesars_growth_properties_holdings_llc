(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Basis of Presentation and Discussion Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC ("CGPH," the "Borrower," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ("CGP LLC"), which is a joint venture between Caesars Acquisition Company ("CAC"), a Delaware corporation, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation ("CEC" or "Caesars Entertainment"). CGPH's properties include The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and Harrah's New Orleans (the "May 2014 Acquisitions"), and Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino ("Planet Hollywood"). Operating Results Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Change Net revenues $ 338.7 $ 335.2 $ 3.5 Income from operations 46.8 56.1 (9.3) Net income 6.4 12.7 (6.3) Adjusted EBITDA(1) 93.4 90.6 2.8 _________________________ (1) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Net income/(loss) to Adjusted Earnings before Interest Income/Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA").  Performance of our casino properties is measured in part through tracking of trips by rated customers, which means a customer whose gaming activity is tracked through the Total Rewards system, referred to as "trips," and spend per rated customer trip, referred to as "spend per trip." A trip is created by a Total Rewards card holder engaging in one or more of the following activities while at our property: (1) hotel stay, (2) gaming activity or (3) a comp redemption, which means the receipt of a complimentary item given out by the casino. Lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program who stay at the property and non-lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program not staying at the property. Customer spend means the cumulative rated theoretical spend (which is the amount of money expected to be retained by the casino based upon the mathematics underlying the particular game as a fraction of the amount of money wagered by the customer) across all game types for a specific customer. The average combined gross hold is the percentage of the amount wagered across all game types (including table games and slot machines) that the casino retained.   Lower casino revenues at Harrah's New Orleans due to unfavorable volume and hold when compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by increased other revenues due to continued expansion of entertainment options; and Increased casino revenues at Planet Hollywood and The Cromwell due to positive variance in gross hold when compared to the prior year.  Net revenues for three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $3.5 million, or 1.0%, when compared with the same period in 2016. Total trips remained consistent during the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Gross casino hold was 11.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Cash average daily room rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased to $147, or 8.1%, when compared to $136 for the same period in 2016. Average daily occupancy was 93.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 93.7% for the same period in 2016. Revenue per available room ("RevPar") for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $133 and $125, respectively, or an increase of 6.4%.  Incentives are often provided for customers to stay and play at our properties. Incentives are provided to customers based on a number of factors such as marketing plans, competitive factors, economic conditions and regulations. These incentives come in a variety of different forms including free and discounted products, gaming credits, food and beverage credits, hotel room credits, and other forms. The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage credits and other services furnished to casino guests is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. Hence, net revenues as discussed above include all promotional allowances. We believe our allocation of promotional allowances to be within industry standards and appropriate for our brands and competitive environment.   Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Change CGPH Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, and 2022 Notes $ (35.9 ) $ (36.9 ) $ 1.0 Cromwell Credit Facility (5.0 ) (5.2 ) 0.2 Other interest income/(expense), including capitalized interest 0.5 (1.3 ) 1.8 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized $ (40.4 ) $ (43.4 ) $ 3.0  Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures CGPH uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its financial performance. EBITDA is comprised of net income before (i) interest expense, net of capitalized interest, (ii) interest income, (iii) provision for income taxes, and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, further adjusted for certain items that CGPH does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance.   Three Months Ended March 31, (In millions) 2017 2016 Net income $ 6.4 $ 12.7 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized 40.4 43.4 Depreciation and amortization 38.5 32.2 EBITDA 85.3 88.3 Stock-based compensation (1) 1.1 1.2 Write-downs, reserves and project opening costs, net of recoveries (2) 5.5 0.2 Other (3) 1.5 0.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 93.4 $ 90.6 _________________________  (2) Amounts include development costs related to the renovation of Planet Hollywood.  (3) Amounts represent other add-backs and deductions to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA but not separately identified, such as acquisition and integration costs and severance expense.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  investment criteria. Cash used for capital expenditures in the normal course of business is typically made available from cash flows generated by our operating activities while cash used for development projects is typically funded from specific project financing and additional debt offerings.  Capital Resources The debt agreements included in Capital Resources are defined in Note 6 - Debt in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this report.

You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You should not place undue reliance on such statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements contain words such as "may," "will," "project," "might," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "would," "estimate," "continue," or "pursue," or the negative of these words or other words or expressions of similar meaning that may identify forward-looking statements and are found at various places throughout this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to future actions, new projects, strategies, future performance, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and future financial results, wherever they occur in this Form 10-Q, are based on our current expectations about future events and are estimates reflecting the best judgment of CGPH's management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified, and, consequently, the actual performance of CGPH may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We disclose important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following factors, as well as other factors described from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained therein):   CGPH's dependence on Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, including Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC ("CES"), to provide support and services, as well as CGPH's dependence on Caesars Entertainment's and CES' senior management's expertise and its participation in Caesars Entertainment's Total Rewards loyalty program; the effects of a default by Caesars Entertainment or Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. ("CEOC") on certain debt obligations; the ability of CEC to meet its financial obligations in light of its limited cash balances; Caesars Entertainment's interests may conflict with CGPH's interests and Caesars Entertainment may possibly keep all potential development opportunities for itself; the adverse effects due to the bankruptcy filing of CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries; the effects if a third-party successfully challenges Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates' ownership of, or right to use, the intellectual property owned or used by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, which CGPH licenses for use in its businesses; the difficulty of operating CGPH's business separately from Caesars Entertainment and managing that process effectively could take up a significant amount of management's time; CGPH's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions and the ability to timely and cost-effectively integrate assets and companies that CGPH acquires into its operations; the effects of any lawsuits against CAC or CGP LLC related to the May 2014 Acquisitions; the adverse effects if extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, which are applicable to CGPH, are enforced; the effects of local and national economic, credit and capital market conditions on the economy in general, and on the gaming industry in particular; the sensitivity of CGPH's business to reductions in discretionary consumer spending;   the changing industry in which CGPH operates;   any failure to protect CGPH's trademarks or other intellectual property;   abnormal gaming holds ("gaming hold" is the amount of money that is retained by the casino from wagers by customers); the effects of competition, including locations of competitors and operating and market competition, particularly the intense competition CGPH's casino properties face in their respective markets;   political and economic uncertainty created by terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility; and the other factors set forth under "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-Q or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10�K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Any forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, as such, speak only as of the date made. CGPH disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this Form 10-Q.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Basis of Presentation and Discussion Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC ("CGPH," the "Borrower," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Caesars Growth Partners, LLC ("CGP LLC"), which is a joint venture between Caesars Acquisition Company ("CAC"), a Delaware corporation, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation ("CEC" or "Caesars Entertainment"). On May 5, 2014, CGP LLC contributed the equity interests of PHWLV, LLC ("PHWLV"), which holds Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino ("Planet Hollywood") and the 50% interest in the management fee revenues of PHW Manager, LLC ("PHW Manager") to CGPH. In addition, CGPH acquired through one or more subsidiaries (i) Corner Investment Company, LLC and its subsidiaries, (collectively known as "The Cromwell"), 3535 LV Corporation (formerly known as "The Quad" and recently rebranded as "The LINQ Hotel & Casino"), and indirect subsidiaries of Parball Corporation (collectively known as "Bally's Las Vegas"), (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the property management agreements entered between a Property Manager (as defined in Note 14 - Related Party Transactions) and the owners of each of these properties, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties (collectively referred to as the "First Closing" or "Acquired Properties Transaction"). On May 20, 2014, CGPH acquired through one or more subsidiaries (i) JCC Holding Company II, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively known as "Harrah's New Orleans"), (ii) 50% of the ongoing management fees and any termination fees payable under the property management agreements entered between a Property Manager (as defined in Note 14 - Related Party Transactions) and the owner of this property, and (iii) certain intellectual property that is specific to each of these properties (the "Second Closing" or "Harrah's Transaction"). The acquisitions of The Cromwell, The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Bally's Las Vegas and Harrah's New Orleans, and the contribution of Planet Hollywood to subsidiaries of CGPH are herein referred to as the "Acquired Properties." Because these acquisitions were accounted for as transactions among entities under common control, the financial information herein includes the financial results for these properties as if those businesses were combined into the CGPH reporting entity through the May 2014 acquisition dates and consolidated into CGP LLC after the May 2014 acquisition dates. Therefore, the financial information contained herein provides comparable results for the periods presented. Operating Results Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change Net revenues $ 317.4 $ 294.1 $ 23.3 $ 630.7 $ 586.1 $ 44.6 Income from operations 54.4 32.5 21.9 104.2 79.3 24.9 Net income/(loss) 14.8 (56.2) 71.0 25.0 (32.4) 57.4 Operating margin (1) 17.1 % 11.1 % 6.0 % 16.5 % 13.5 % 3.0 % Adjusted EBITDA(2) 89.6 69.6 20.0 168.7 144.5 24.2 _________________________ (1) Operating margin is calculated as income from operations divided by net revenues.  (2) See Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Net (loss)/income to Adjusted Earnings before Interest Income/Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA").  Performance of our casino properties is measured in part through tracking of trips by rated customers, which means a customer whose gaming activity is tracked through Caesars Entertainment's Total Rewards system, referred to as "trips," and spend per rated customer trip, referred to as "spend per trip." A trip is created by a Total Rewards card holder engaging in one or more of the following activities while at our property: (1) hotel stay, (2) gaming activity or (3) a comp redemption, which means the receipt of a complimentary item given out by the casino. Lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program who stay at the property and non-lodgers are guests registered with the Total Rewards program not staying at the property. Customer spend means the cumulative rated theoretical spend (which is the amount of money expected to be retained by the casino based upon the mathematics underlying the particular game as a fraction of the amount of money wagered by the customer) across all game types for a specific customer. The average combined gross hold is the percentage of the amount wagered across all game types (including table games and slot machines) that the casino retained.  at The LINQ Hotel & Casino and the opening of The Cromwell offset by a decrease in revenue due to the impact of the smoking ban implemented on April 22, 2015 at Harrah's New Orleans. Total trips increased by approximately 3.6% during the three months ended June 30, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by increase in trips by both lodgers and non-lodgers. Total spend per trip decreased by approximately 4.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 versus the same period in 2014 due to less spend by both lodgers and non-lodgers. Gross casino hold increased from 11.4% to 12.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Room revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $82.5 million and $64.9 million, respectively. Cash average daily room rates for the three months ended June 30, 2015 increased to $120, or approximately 11.1%, when compared to $108 for the same period in 2014, primarily due to renovated rooms available at The LINQ Hotel & Casino and the increase in resort fees in late 2014. Average daily occupancy was 94.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 92.8% for the same period in 2014. Revenue per available room ("RevPar") for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $113 and $102, respectively.  include all promotional allowances. CGPH believes their allocation of promotional allowances to be within industry standards and appropriate for our brands and competitive environment.   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change Interest expense, net of interest $ (39.6 ) $ (61.4 ) $ (79.2 ) $ (76.3 ) capitalized $ 21.8 $ (2.9 ) Loss on extinguishment of - (23.2 ) - (23.8 ) debt 23.2 23.8 Provision for income - (4.1 ) - (11.6 ) taxes 4.1 11.6  Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, decreased by $21.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared with the same period in 2014 and increased by $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared with the same period in 2014. The change is primarily related to the debt incurred in May 2014 by CGPH to fund the Acquired Properties Transaction and Harrah's Transaction. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, due to these transactions was $37.4 million and $53.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $73.5 million and $53.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  below. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information that allows a better understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of capital investment decisions made for the long-term benefit of CGPH.   Three Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2015 2014 Net income/(loss) $ 14.8 $ (56.2 ) Provision for income taxes - 4.1 Income/(loss) before income taxes 14.8 (52.1 ) Interest expense, net of interest capitalized 39.6 61.4 Depreciation and amortization 31.6 25.2 EBITDA 86.0 34.5 Loss on extinguishment of debt (1) - 23.2 Write-downs, reserves and project opening costs, 2.4 net of recoveries (2) 7.5 Acquisition and integration costs 0.2 4.3 Stock-based compensation (3) 1.0 - Other (4) - 0.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 89.6 $ 69.6 Six Months Ended June 30, (In millions) 2015 2014 Net income/(loss) $ 25.0 $ (32.4 ) Provision for income taxes - 11.6 Income/(loss) before income taxes 25.0 (20.8 ) Interest expense, net of interest capitalized 79.2 76.3 Depreciation and amortization 57.4 47.3 EBITDA 161.6 102.8 Loss on extinguishment of debt (1) - 23.8 Write-downs, reserves and project opening costs, 4.7 net of recoveries (2) 13.4 Acquisition and integration costs 0.4 4.3 Stock-based compensation (3) 1.9 - Other (4) 0.1 0.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 168.7 $ 144.5 _________________________  (2) Amounts primarily represent development costs related to the construction of The Cromwell and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel & Casino.  (3) Amounts represent non-cash stock based compensation expense.  (4) Amounts represent other add-backs and deductions to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA but not separately identified, such as severance expense.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, capital expenditures net of related payables were $69.1 million and $86.3 million, respectively, primarily related to construction at The LINQ Hotel & Casino and The Cromwell. Capital expenditures net of related payables for The LINQ Hotel & Casino were $55.8 million and $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures net of related payables for The Cromwell were $51.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, capital expenditures net of related payables were $109.1 million and $153.0 million, respectively, primarily related to construction at The LINQ Hotel & Casino and The Cromwell. Capital expenditures net of related payables for The LINQ Hotel & Casino were $85.7 million and $23.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Capital expenditures net of related payables for The Cromwell were $94.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  On May 20, 2014, the Borrower, the subsidiary guarantors and the First Lien Collateral Agent also entered into the collateral agreement (first lien) (the "First Lien Collateral Agreement") and other security documents defining the terms of the security interests that secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the related guarantees and Other First Priority Lien Obligations (as defined therein). These security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the obligations of the Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the related guarantees and the security documents. . . .

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Caesars Makes Another Move to Insulate Healthy Subsidiaries









Lisa Allen




May 23, 2014 9:34 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK (The Deal) -- Las Vegas-based casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR) has taken another step to protect its healthier subsidiaries from a potential bankruptcy filing at the debt-laden operating unit. A May 21 regulatory filing revealed the terms of a new shared-services agreement that transfers ownership of intellectual property and popular loyalty rewards programs that were previously wholly-owned by the troubled operating unit, Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. (CEOC), into a new joint venture controlled by CEOC, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties LLC (CERP), and a vehicle created last year, Caesars Growth Partners Holdings LLC (CGPH). The JV, called Caesars Enterprise Services LLC, will be majority-owned by CEOC (69%), while CERP will hold 20.2% and CGP will hold 10.8%. All the parties, however, will have equal voting rights, with some veto privileges afforded to CEOC. "The implicit rationale seems to be an attempt to shield CERP and CGPH from a CEOC bankruptcy," CreditSights Inc. analysts said in a May 21 report. CreditSights analyst Christopher Snow said by phone on Thursday that he doesn't think the agreement is designed to create opportunities to strip CEOC of its rights to use the intellectual property and loyalty programs, but rather to protect CERP and CGPH's rights to use them in case of a bankruptcy. The provisions of the agreement state that if any member of Caesars Enterprise Services files for bankruptcy, it will lose its "governance rights" in the JV. If CEOC filed for bankruptcy, for example, it would still have rights to the intellectual property, but it would lose the ability to control how its JV partners used it royalty-free, as CreditSights understands it. The May 21 report calls this provision "absurd." If CEOC's creditors were to take control of the unit during a bankruptcy restructuring, this JV agreement would prevent the creditors from trying to cordon off the IP and rewards program within CEOC, Snow said. "The bondholders in the CEOC structure are going to litigate on a lot of grounds," Snow said, citing concerns that asset transfers out of CEOC constitute fraudulent conveyance, and also that the recent cancellation of the parent company's guarantee of CEOC's debt wasn't permissible under certain bond indentures. "This [shared-services] contract is also going to be litigated," he said, concluding, ""I think this is going to get tied up with everything in the [potential] bankruptcy." Caesars and its private equity sponsors, Apollo Global Management LLC and TPG Capital LP, have been working to revamp Caesars Entertainment's capital structure, creating new business units, selling assets between units, and refinancing debt to push back maturities.

Caesars Entertainment Announces Sale of $2.2 Billion of Assets to Caesars Growth Partners
Represents First of Anticipated Steps to Address Capital Structure of CEOC Subsidiary


LAS VEGAS, March 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Bally's Las Vegas, The Cromwell (formerly Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon), The Quad and Harrah's New Orleans to Caesars Growth Partners, LLC for a purchase price of $2.2 billion, including assumed debt of $185 million and committed project capital expenditures of $223 million, resulting in anticipated cash proceeds of $1.8 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 
2014, subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. These actions are part of ongoing efforts to address Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc.'s ("CEOC") overall capital structure and position that subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment to enhance equity value.  

Caesars Entertainment and its affiliated companies will manage the purchased properties, allowing continued integration with the Total Rewards network and related synergies. The sale of Bally's, The Cromwell, The Quad and Harrah's New Orleans to Caesars Growth Partners preserves the network value of the four properties while enhancing liquidity at CEOC. The sale also includes a financial stake in the associated management fee stream. This asset sale will also facilitate new investment in these properties, some of which require considerable capital expenditures to realize their full potential as part of Caesars' network at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. 
The asset sale was negotiated and unanimously recommended by special committees comprised of independent members of the boards of directors of Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Caesars Acquisition Company (NASDAQ: CACQ), the managing member of Caesars Growth Partners. Centerview Partners and Duff & Phelps served as financial advisors to the special committee of Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Reed Smith LLP served as the committee's legal counsel. With this transaction, Caesars Acquisition Company has announced a $223 million 
renovation of The Quad Resort & Casino.
"Since being taken private near the beginning of the global financial crisis, we have faced an incredibly challenging business environment and a highly leveraged capital structure. Despite these obstacles, we have invested significantly in the growth of our network and the enhancement of our assets while concurrently deploying a wide array of financial and operational tools to manage the company's capital structure and create value," said Gary Loveman, chairman and chief executive officer of Caesars Entertainment. "Entering 2014, I am very excited about our new customer offerings. Across our network, we have recently opened or will open promising new projects and amenities, such as The LINQ and High Roller and upgrades throughout Las 
Vegas. We also share in the economic benefits associated with Caesars Growth Partners, including considerable growth last year at Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc., through social and mobile games and the launch of real-money online gaming in Nevada and New Jersey."  
Caesars Entertainment today has a market capitalization of approximately $3.5 billion and is now comprised of three primary structures: Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties (CERP), its interest in Caesars Growth Partners, LLC (CGP), a joint venture in which Caesars Entertainment holds a 58% economic interest, and CEOC. CERP is made up of six casino properties, predominantly in Las Vegas, as well as The LINQ development and the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace. Caesars Growth Partners owns Caesars Interactive Entertainment as well as the Planet Hollywood Resort in Las Vegas, a 41% interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and the assets that will be acquired through this transaction. Caesars Growth Partners' managing member is Caesars Acquisition Company, a nearly $2 billion market capitalization publicly traded company. 
"Today's asset sales mark an important step in our ongoing efforts to repair CEOC's balance sheet," Loveman said. "Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company have a combined equity market capitalization of more than $5 billion. To build equity value, we have employed a full complement of operating and financial tools. The toolbox, which includes cost management, working capital management, operational improvements, acquisitions, asset sales, credit agreement amendments, innovative operating strategies, exchange offers and equity raises, has helped to create two stable entities.  The company expects to deploy a similar array of tools to improve CEOC's financial position and build equity value."
Pro forma for this transaction, CEOC will have in excess of $3.2 billion in cash as of December 31, 2013. CEOC will also be relieved of potential capital expenditure requirements for the purchased properties. CEOC intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the asset sales to reduce bank debt.
In addition to financial and capital structure initiatives, Caesars is focused on generating additional operational efficiency in 2014. In 2013, the company implemented a program to both improve its working capital and excess cash by $500 million and to generate $500 million of operating and EBITDA improvements. Through this plan, the company has made substantial progress towards that goal and expects the program to benefit CEOC this year. The company plans to provide updates on additional achievements during 2014. The recent ratification of a new long-term labor agreement in Nevada presents Caesars with a stable platform for growth opportunities, particularly in the hospitality and entertainment segments.
Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results 
Separately, Caesars Entertainment announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2013 that include consolidated results for Caesars Growth Partners. The company expects to report its financial results for the quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2013 in March. 
Commenting on the results, Loveman concluded: "2013 was a year of considerable progress and activity for Caesars. We significantly invested in growth projects and undertook a number of actions designed to enhance the company's capital structure and create value. For the fourth quarter, performance in some of our regional areas, particularly Atlantic City, was disappointing. We are, however, encouraged by volume and visitation trends in Las Vegas. We are excited about our prospects there fueled by organic growth as well as our hospitality investments."
While Caesars Entertainment has not yet completed its financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, the company currently expects consolidated net revenue to be in the range of approximately $2,050 million to $2,110 million and that its Adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of approximately $395 million to $415 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Estimated net loss attributable to Caesars Entertainment for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 is expected to range between $1,700 million and $1,820 million, compared to net loss attributable to Caesars Entertainment of 
$480.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
Consolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to increase slightly as compared to the prior year primarily due to the combination of increases in pass-through reimbursable management costs, growth at Caesars Interactive Entertainment and declines in promotional allowance, offset by lower casino revenue. The decline in casino revenue is primarily attributable to continued weakness in certain domestic markets outside of Nevada and the impact on revenues resulting from the partial sale of our Conrad Punta del Este, Uruguay casino in the second quarter 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be down slightly as compared to the prior year due to the decline in casino revenues. Net loss attributable to Caesars Entertainment for the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 2012 is expected to increase as a result of significantly larger impairments of tangible and intangible assets in 2013 as compared to the prior year quarter, as well as the income impact of lower casino revenues, and increased interest expense, partially offset by lower depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated early in 2013.
A reconciliation of estimated net loss attributable to Caesars Entertainment, its most comparable measure in accordance with GAAP, to estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 and a reconciliation of historical net loss attributable to Caesars Entertainment to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 are provided below.
