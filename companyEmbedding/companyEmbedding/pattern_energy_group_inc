About 


Pattern Energy has a portfolio of 20 wind power facilities, including two projects it has agreed to acquire, with a total owned interest of 2,736 MW in the United States, Canada and Chile that use proven, best-in-class technology. These facilities generate stable long-term cash flows in attractive markets that have strong growth potential. Each of our facilities has contracted to sell all of its energy output, or a majority, on a long-term, fixed-price power sale agreement. Eighty-nine percent of the electricity to be generated by our facilities will be sold under these power sale agreements, which have a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 14 years.
Our seasoned management team has worked together for 10 years and possesses more than 20 years of experience on average in the energy industry. We have developed, financed and managed more than $12 billion of infrastructure assets, including more than 4,500 MW of wind power projects and facilities. The Pattern Energy team is driven by a creative entrepreneurial spirit which is sustained by years of experience.
We intend to create long-term value for our shareholders in an environmentally responsible manner and with respect for the communities in which we operate. Our business is built on three core values of creative energy and spirit, pride of ownership and follow through, and a team first attitude.
Pattern Energy’s financial objective is to create long-term value for our shareholders by producing stable and sustainable cash for distribution, grow our portfolio of facilities and our dividend, and maintain a strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure. We intend to grow our business through third-party acquisitions, including from Pattern Energy Group LP, our main shareholder and a leading North American power developer.

Communities 


We place great importance on being an active part of the local communities in which we operate. We work proactively with local leaders, environmental organizations, and entities to identify and address their concerns, as well as expand the benefits from our facilities. We recognize the impact our facilities have on the local environment and our goal is to be a contributing member of the community.
Our facilities benefit communities through increased tax revenue, job creation and other contributions. Our facilities create new jobs and we strongly encourage our contractors to hire qualified local subcontractors whenever possible.
Our presence also brings significant indirect economic benefits to the community through increased revenues for service industries and the purchase of goods and services during construction and operation.
Landowner participation and support is integral to any project we undertake. We understand the trust that has been placed in us, and we are committed to the good stewardship of the land throughout the duration of the project. Once a facility is operational, our contracts provide landowners with a steady revenue stream. As a result, wind power generation can increase the economic return of the land, without sacrificing the regular use of that land.

About 


Pattern Energy has a portfolio of 20 wind power facilities, including two projects it has agreed to acquire, with a total owned interest of 2,736 MW in the United States, Canada and Chile that use proven, best-in-class technology. These facilities generate stable long-term cash flows in attractive markets that have strong growth potential. Each of our facilities has contracted to sell all of its energy output, or a majority, on a long-term, fixed-price power sale agreement. Eighty-nine percent of the electricity to be generated by our facilities will be sold under these power sale agreements, which have a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 14 years.
Our seasoned management team has worked together for 10 years and possesses more than 20 years of experience on average in the energy industry. We have developed, financed and managed more than $12 billion of infrastructure assets, including more than 4,500 MW of wind power projects and facilities. The Pattern Energy team is driven by a creative entrepreneurial spirit which is sustained by years of experience.
We intend to create long-term value for our shareholders in an environmentally responsible manner and with respect for the communities in which we operate. Our business is built on three core values of creative energy and spirit, pride of ownership and follow through, and a team first attitude.
Pattern Energy’s financial objective is to create long-term value for our shareholders by producing stable and sustainable cash for distribution, grow our portfolio of facilities and our dividend, and maintain a strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure. We intend to grow our business through third-party acquisitions, including from Pattern Energy Group LP, our main shareholder and a leading North American power developer.

PEGI: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 01/31/2017 settlement date, and Pattern Energy Group Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 10.03 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.13. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
