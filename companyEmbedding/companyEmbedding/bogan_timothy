Charge 01: FEDERAL AGENCY HOLD                     Bond or Fine: $.00 Court File #:  Disposition of Charge: RELEASED TO OTHER AGENCY Disposition Date: 2003/03/06



The Detentions Division of the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department services the secure detention needs of the criminal justice community, together with the public safety needs of the citizens of Kenosha County. This is accomplished by providing housing for pretrial detainees in a system of modern linear confinement, and sentenced persons in a direct supervision environment. All incarceration is managed by policies that hold inmates accountable for their behavior. This system of safe and appropriate housing of detainees is the product of Objective Inmate Classification, which determines risk levels. This safe and secure confinement includes responsible management, aided by community based programming providing practical life skills exposure. This creates a perpetual goal of releasing persons from confinement back into the community in a condition no worse then when they first arrived. 

The professional principles of the American Jail Association, the American Correctional Association, and the National Commission for Correctional Health Care will serve to continually guide the management and operation of these facilities. This responsible management, together with continual training of staff, will maintain effective control of Detentions Division operations in the most cost-effective manner possible.
