ALLEGHANY CORPORATION  1411 Broadway, 34th Floor  New York, NY 10018   
ALLEGHANY CORPORATION REPORTS 2016 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR RESULTS 
NEW YORK, NY, February 22, 2017  Alleghany Corporation (NYSE-Y)
announced today its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. Highlights are listed below.   


 
●
 
Book value per common share1 was $515.24 as of December 31, 2016, an increase of 6.0% from book value per common share1 as of December 31, 2015.   


 
●
 
Book value per common share1 decreased 1.9% from book value per common share1 as of September 30, 2016.
  


 
●
 
Alleghany reported net earnings2 of $456.9 million for the full year 2016, compared with $560.3 million for the full year 2015. 
 


 
●
 
Alleghany reported net earnings2 of $69.5 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, compared with $156.1 million for the 2015 fourth quarter. 
 


 
●
 
Alleghany reported $29.59 of earnings per diluted share and $28.83 of operating earnings per diluted share for the full year 2016, compared with $35.13 and $31.86, respectively, for the full year 2015.
  


 
●
 
Alleghany reported $4.45 of earnings per diluted share and $7.02 of operating earnings per diluted share for the 2016 fourth quarter, compared with $9.85 and $8.44, respectively, for the 2015 fourth quarter.
 Weston Hicks, President and chief executive officer of Alleghany, stated, Our fourth quarter and full year results
reflect solid underwriting performance from each of our (re)insurance businesses as they continued to execute their respective business plans, somewhat offset by an impairment charge at SORC. The combined ratio was 91.7% in the fourth quarter and
91.9% for the full year, despite elevated catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter underwriting results reflect favorable prior accident year reserve development of $106.3 million, primarily at TransRe and RSUI, partially offset by catastrophe
losses of $66.1 million, primarily from Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. TransRe and RSUI continue to demonstrate leadership in their respective markets and remain well positioned for 2017. CapSpecialty and PacificComp also performed well as
both achieved underwriting profitability in the quarter, and in CapSpecialtys case, for the full year. These strong underwriting results were offset by a challenging investment environment in the fourth quarter, when rising rates negatively
impacted book value.       
   
1  Stockholders equity attributable to Alleghany stockholders divided by common stock
outstanding.  2  Net earnings attributable to Alleghany stockholders.

It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

y_10k_2017-02-22_142_50Revenue - GeographyCatastrophe losses in 2016 primarily reflect losses from flooding and severe weather primarily in the State of Texas in April and May, losses from wildfires in Alberta, Canada in May, losses from flooding and severe weather primarily in the State of Louisiana and the Midwestern U.S. in the third quarter, losses from wildfires in the State of Tennessee in November and $26.8 million of losses from Hurricane Matthew, which caused property damage and flooding in the Southeast Coast of the U.S. in October.
y_10k_2017-02-22_304_299Revenue - ProductStrains on liquidity could result from: i the occurrence of several significant catastrophe events in a relatively short period of time ii the sale of investments into a depressed marketplace to fund these paid losses iii the uncollectibility of reinsurance recoverables on these paid losses iv the significant decrease in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables or v a significant reduction in our net premium collections.
y_10k_2017-02-22_158_62Financial - IncomeThe decrease in net investment income in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflects lower dividends from common stocks in our equity securities portfolio, lower interest income and lower earnings from other invested assets.
y_10k_2017-02-22_148_58MA - OtherThe favorable prior accident year loss reserve development in 2016 related primarily to the 2012 and prior accident years, and reflects favorable loss emergence compared with loss emergence patterns assumed in earlier periods.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.
