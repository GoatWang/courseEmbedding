					World's Largest Manufacturer of Activated Carbon				
With 75 years of Activated Carbon expertise, Calgon Carbon remains the world's largest manufacturer of granular activated carbon. No one else even comes close. 








As the industry forerunner, Calgon Carbon has originated cutting-edge purification systems for drinking water, wastewater, odor control, pollution abatement, and a variety of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes. We currently offer carbon technologies used in over 700 distinct market applications from purifying air and drinking water, to purifying foods and pharmaceuticals, to separating gas and removing mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Calgon Carbon’s cost-effective, environmental remediation/recycle programs combine the proper mix of an effective activated carbon, ingenious adsorption systems and professional field/technical services.
An Industry Leader
Calgon Carbon backs its products with comprehensive analytical support, including feasibility studies and cost evaluations, together with complete system design, service, and troubleshooting. You get the expertise of an industry leader in granular activated carbon backed by service you can trust.
Calgon Carbon brings unmatched expertise in developing activated carbons. That means whatever your activated carbon need, Calgon Carbon has a product engineered specifically to provide a better solution.


What is Activated Carbon?
Activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as “adsorption.” In adsorption, organic molecules contained in a liquid or gas are attracted and bound to the surface of the pores of the activated carbon as the liquid or gas is passed through.
Adsorption occurs on the internal surface of activated carbon, termed the adsorbent. During adsorption, liquids or gases pass through the highly porous structure of the activated carbon. The compound(s) to be removed, termed the adsorbate(s), diffuses to the surface of the adsorbent and is retained because of attractive forces.
The primary raw material used in the production of our activated carbons is bituminous coal that is crushed, sized and processed in low temperature bakers followed by high-temperature activation furnaces. Activation develops the pore structure of the carbon. Through adjustments in the activation process, differentiated pores for a particular purification application are developed.
What is Carbon Reactivation?
Calgon Carbon Reactivation Services include the reactivation of spent carbon on a custom basis or a pool basis. Customers in the municipal drinking water, food application or industrial sectors can have their spent carbon reactivated with the resultant product being returned to them (Custom Reactivation). Alternatively, customers may put their spent carbon into a generic pool for reactivation, making this a cost-effective product alternative when getting your own material returned is not required or a cost-effective recycling option as opposed to disposal when virgin material is required.
Calgon Carbon’s custom municipal reactivation (CMR) products, custom food grade reactivation (CFR) products and custom industrial reactivation (CIR) products are put through the same quality testing system as the original virgin materials.

•Manmade fully fluorinated compounds which are not naturally found in the environment.
 •Are used in a variety of products such as fire fighting foams, coating additives as a surface-activeagent.
 •PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) and PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) are the most commonly produced PFCs.
 •Large amounts of PFCs have been produced during past manufacturing processes and released to the air, soil and water.
Why are PFCs harmful?
•PFOA and PFOS are persistent and mobile in the atmosphere and aqueous environments, due to their chemical stability and low volatility.
 •Animal toxicology studies indicate potential developmental, reproductive and systematic effects.
 •After oral exposure, PFCs accumulate and adsorb in the serum, kidney, and liver.
 •Resistant to direct oxidation, photolytic degradation, biodegradation and air stripping/ vapor extraction, making their removal difficult.
What is the EPA’s stance?
•PFOS and PFOA are on the EPA’s Contaminant Candidate List 4 (CCL 4).
 •The EPA has taken steps to further investigate PFOAs and related chemicals as well as to reduce their emissions and use in products.
What is the solution?
•Granular activated carbon (GAC) filters have been recognized as effective technologies for reducing perfluorinated compounds from water.
 •Incineration of any concentrated PFC waste is required for complete destruction of PFOS and PFOA. Spent activated carbon containing adsorbed species can be thermally reactivated , destroying the adsorbed contaminants and allowing the activated carbon to be recycled and reused.
 •Recent Accelerated Column Tests (ACTs) of Calgon Carbon type Filtrasorb 400 and Filtrasorb 600virgin GAC shows successful removal of perfluorinated compounds including Perfluorobutanoic Acid (PFBA), Perfluoropentanoic Acid (PFPA), Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA), Perfluoroheptanoic Acid (PFHtA), Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), Perfluorodeconaoic Acid (PFDA).
 •The strong fluorine-carbon bond and low vapor pres-sure makes PFOA/PFOS resistant to a number of conventional water treatment technologies, including direct oxidation, biodegradation, air stripping, vapor extraction and direct photolysis (UV).
 •Since each water source contains different combinations and levels of PFCs, as well as TOCs, it is advised that a lab or pilot test (such as an Accelerated Column Test or ACT) be performed on a representative water sample to determine the adsorption zone needed, as well as the estimated carbon exhaustion rate to properly design an activated carbon adsorption system.
What can Calgon Carbon do for you?
•Provide proven and cost effective solutions with activated carbon adsorption technology that cover a broad range of applications and system sizes.
 •Temporary and permanent GAC systems that can be rapidly deployed.
 •Our technical and engineering team can perform laboratory and field tests as needed, and tailor solutions for various application and customer needs. CCC has carbon reactivation sites globally that will thermally destroy the PFCs and enable the reuse of the activated carbon.

Calgon Carbon Corporation is an environmentally conscious company – sustainability has vital implications in what we do every single day. Recycling and reactivation are important parts of those initiatives. In fact, we have been recycling for years by reactivating spent carbon.
Features & Benefits:
After an activated carbon’s adsorptive capacity has been exhausted, it can be returned to Calgon Carbon for thermal reactivation. With high temperature reactivation followed by off-gas treatment, the adsorbed organic compounds are destroyed and reactivated carbon can be safely and cost-effectively recycled back to facilities for continued use. A number of important steps are involved in the reactivation process:

Spent activated carbon is heated in furnaces devoid of oxygen using steam as a selective oxidant.
Adsorbed organics are either volatilized from the activated carbon or pyrolysed to a carbon char.
Volatilized organics are destroyed in the furnace’s afterburner.
Acid gases are removed by means of a chemical scrubber.
The high-temperature reaction with steam serves to restore the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon.

Through reactivation, the spent granular activated carbon can be recycled for reuse, virtually eliminating the costs and long-term liability associated with disposal.
A significant benefit of reactivation and recycling is that the CO2 footprint associated with reactivation is significantly lower than that associated with the production, supply and use of virgin activated carbon. With carbon reactivation facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia, Calgon Carbon makes it easy to help your company meet sustainability goals. Reactivated carbon is also an efficient, cost-effective alternative to virgin where appropriate.
Calgon Carbon Reactivation Services include the reactivation of spent granular activated carbon on a custom basis or a pool basis. Customers in the municipal drinking water, food application or industrial sectors can have their spent carbon reactivated with the resultant product being returned to them (Custom Reactivation). Alternatively, customers may put their spent carbon into a generic pool for reactivation, making this a cost-effective product alternative when getting your own material returned is not required or a cost-effective recycling option as opposed to disposal when virgin material is required.
Calgon Carbon’s custom municipal reactivation (CMR) products, custom food grade reactivation (CFR) products and custom industrial reactivation (CIR) products are put through the same quality testing system as the original virgin materials.

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]

The Company provides purification solutions for drinking water, wastewater, pollution abatement, and a range of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes. The Company operates through four segments: Activated Carbon and Service, Equipment, Consumer and Other. The Company's products and services are designed to protect human health and the environment from harmful contaminants in water and air. The Company provides purification solutions for drinking water, wastewater, pollution abatement, and a range of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes. The Activated Carbon and Service segment manufactures granular activated carbon for use in applications to remove organic compounds from liquids, gases, water, and air. It also consists of services related to activated carbon, including reactivation of spent carbon and the leasing, monitoring, and maintenance of carbon fills at customer sites. The service portion of this segment also includes services related to the Company's ion exchange technologies for treatment of groundwater and process streams. The Equipment segment provides solutions to customers' air and water process problems through the design, fabrication, and operation of systems that utilizes its enabling technologies: ballast water, UV light, advanced ion exchange separation and carbon adsorption. The Consumer segment supplies activated carbon cloth for use in military, industrial, and medical applications. The Other segment manufactures and markets granular and powdered wood-based activated carbon, coal-based activated carbon reactivation, diatomaceous earth and perlite filtration media for use in applications for decolorization, purification, decontamination, and filtration of liquids in various applications, including food and beverage, industrial, fine chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The Company operates in the United States, Europe, Japan, Africa, Canada, China, India, Latin America, and in other parts of Asia.The Company participates in six markets: Potable Water, Industrial Process, Environmental Water, Environmental Air, Food and Beverage, and Specialty markets. Potable Water applications include municipal drinking water treatment, as well as point of entry and point of use devices. Applications in the Industrial Process Market include catalysis, product recovery and purification of chemicals, specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, as well as process water treatment. The applications for the two Environmental markets include wastewater treatment, groundwater remediation, ballast water treatment, volatile organic compound (VOC) removal from vapors, and mercury control in flue gas streams. Food and Beverage applications include wine, bottling, brewing, amino acids and sweetener purification. Medical, personal protection (military and industrial), automotive, consumer, and precious metals applications comprise the Specialty Market.Activated Carbon and Service.The sale of activated carbon is the component of the Activated Carbon and Service business segment. The Company is engaged in the manufacturer of bituminous coal-based granular activated carbon. Activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as adsorption. The raw material used in the production of the Company's activated carbons is bituminous coal, which is crushed, sized and then processed in rotary kilns followed by high temperature furnaces. This heating process is known as activation and develops the pore structure of the carbon. Through adjustments in the activation process, pores of the required size and number are developed for a particular purification application. The Company also markets activated carbons from other raw materials, including coconut shell and wood. It produces and sells a range of activated, impregnated or acid washed carbons in granular, powdered or pellet form. Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) particles are irregular in shape and generally used in fixed filter beds for continuous flow purification processes. Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is carbon that has been pulverized into powder and is often used in batch purification processes, in municipal water treatment applications and for flue gas emissions control. Pelletized activated carbons are extruded particles, cylindrical in shape, and are typically used for gas phase applications due to the low pressure drop, high mechanical strength, and low dust content of the product. Another important component of the Activated Carbon and Service business segment is the optional services that the Company makes available to purchasers of its products and systems.The Company offers a range of treatment services for customers, including carbon supply, equipment leasing, installation and demobilization, transportation, and spent carbon reactivation. Other services include feasibility testing, process design, performance monitoring, and maintenance of Company-owned adsorption equipment. Its service business focuses on spent carbon reactivation and re-supply. It provides reactivation services in packages ranging from a 55 gallon drum to truckload quantities.The Company's custom reactivation process for the United States municipal drinking water treatment plants is tailored to meet the demands of the drinking water industry. The Company maintains the integrity of each drinking water provider's carbon, and its potable reactivation facilities and procedures adhere to AWWA B605. The Company's Blue Lake, California, Columbus, Ohio, North Tonawanda, New York, and Gila Bend, Arizona plants have received certification from the National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) under NSF/American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard 61: Drinking Water System Components- Health Effects for custom reactivated carbon for potable water applications. Transportation services are offered through activated carbon deliveries and spent carbon returns through its private fleet of trailers, capable of transporting both hazardous and non-hazardous material.EquipmentAlong with providing activated carbon products, the Company has developed a portfolio of standardized, pre-engineered, activated carbon adsorption systems-for both liquid and vapor applications, which can be delivered and installed at treatment sites. Liquid phase equipment systems are used for potable water treatment, process purification, wastewater treatment, groundwater remediation, and de-chlorination. Vapor phase equipment systems are used to control VOC emissions, off gases from air strippers, and landfill gas production. It also manufactures and sells a line of UV light disinfection equipment. The Company participates in the marketplace for UV technologies with its Sentinel line designed to protect municipal drinking water supplies from pathogens, the C3 Series open-channel wastewater disinfection product line for municipal wastewater disinfection, and Rayox UV advanced oxidation equipment for treatment of contaminants in groundwater, process water, and industrial wastewater.Under the trade name, Hyde Marine, the Company also manufactures and sells UV ballast water management systems (BWMS) that combine filtration and UV disinfection to treat and disinfect the ballast water taken in by a ship in one location, and discharged in another, to prevent the spread of non-indigenous aquatic organisms. The Company also manufactures and sells fixed bed and continuous ion exchange equipment. The continuous Ionic Separator (ISEP) and Chromatographic Separator (CSEP) units are used for the purification, separation and recovery of many products in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, mining, chemical, and biotechnology industries. The ISEP and CSEP systems are used in installations worldwide for a range of applications in industrial settings, as well as in selected environmental applications, including perchlorate and nitrate removal from drinking water. The core technology of these systems is the rotary distribution valve. This valve technology is offered in combination with a turntable for movement of media vessels, or with static media vessels where vessel-movement is simulated by advances in valve technology. The Company assembles its equipment using parts that are both manufactured internally, as well as purchased from other suppliers. It can also outsource to other qualified manufacturers for meeting the demand.ConsumerThe primary product offered in the Consumer segment is carbon cloth. Carbon cloth, which is activated carbon in cloth form, is manufactured in the United Kingdom and sold to the medical, military, and specialty markets. Activated carbon cloth can be used in numerous additional applications, including sensor protection, filters for ostomy bags, wound dressings, conservation of artifacts, and respiratory masks.OtherThe Company's New Business is reported in Other segment. The New Business is a European manufacturer of wood-based activated carbon, coal-based activated carbon reactivation, and diatomaceous earth and perlite filtration media, and a distributor of such products and services primarily throughout the European region and into Asia.

Weighing Carbon For Industrial Wastewater Treatment
Industrial wastewater operations have to tangle with myriad regulations and countless contaminants every day, making their work some of the most complicated that the treatment sector has to offer. Wrapping one’s head around these challenges can be difficult, but finding the solutions for them can be near impossible. Luckily, there’s an age-old technology that continues to offer industrial wastewater treatment operators salvation.









Remove Perfluorinated Compounds From Drinking Water — Without Creating A Toxic Waste Stream
Water utility managers have a lot of responsibilities, not the least of which is to keep up with the latest in the industry—contaminants, regulations, technology, and trends. And perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are on the horizon as contaminants that may affect the public health. Water Online spoke with Calgon Carbon about these important emerging contaminants and how best to remove them.









Granular Activated Carbon Removes PFOA From Drinking Water
In the fall of 2015, a small village on the border of Vermont in New York State, tested positive for Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs), specifically Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), in the municipal drinking water. The influent levels of PFOA in the water were above 600 ng/L, and thus considered harmful to village residents. Realizing that PFOA was on the U.S. EPA Contaminant Candidate List, the Village solicited the services of engineering firm CT Male Associates to investigate treatment options and provide a treatment system.









Calgon Corporation Corporate Brochure
Through air and water purification services, solutions and technologies, Calgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE: CCC) is deeply immersed in helping communities locally, nationally, and around the world meet today’s most daunting air and water purification challenges.









Granular Activated Carbon Removes 1, 2, 3 – TCP
What is 1, 2, 3 - TCP? 1, 2, 3 - TCP is a man-made, colorless, chlorinated hydrocarbon that is used as a degreasing and cleaning agent and industrial solvent. It was also used as a chemical in pesticides for low growing crops such as potatoes, tobacco, and beets. 1, 2, 3 - TCP passes through soil and leaches into ground water, contaminating drinking water sources. 1, 2, 3 - TCP is a non-aqueous liquid that is more dense than water, making it difficult to remove from ground water wells. This compound is currently unregulated by the USEPA, although it is on the Contaminant Candidate List 4 (CCL4) for future regulation.









How To Fight 1,4-Dioxane
1,4-Dioxane is a contaminant that is known to linger in groundwater and have adverse health effects when consumed. Worse still, it can pose some significant treatment challenges to the operations tasked with eliminating it.






Calgon Carbon Responds To Recently Approved Amendment To The 2004 International Ballast Water Management Convention Implementation Schedule
Calgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE: CCC) (Calgon Carbon or the Company) today announced its disappointment with an amendment made to the implementation schedule for ships to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2004 International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the Convention) that was agreed to at the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meetings held last week in London, England. In summary, the amendment to the Convention









Treatment Alternatives For PFCs
Over the past two years, no groundwater issue has perhaps received as much community focus and attention as polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances like PFOA and PFOS, often referred to as perflourinated compounds (PFCs). The U.S. EPA issued a health advisory, limiting the amount of these compounds to 70 parts/trillion which kicked off a nationwide evaluation of local water sources.









How To Select The Right Activated Carbon For PFAS Removal
No water contamination issue is grabbing more headlines these days than that of perfluorinated chemicals, commonly referred to as PFCs or PFAS. Concerns over the chemicals have sprung up all over the country, prompted by contamination from industrial wastewater and military firefighting foam. Regardless of where the issue has come up or what caused it, everyone who has been affected wants the same thing: an effective treatment solution. To discuss such a solution, Water Online spoke with Calgon Carbon Corporation.






Calgon Carbon Awarded 2.9 Million Pound Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) Water Treatment Contract For Choa Chu Kang (CCK) Waterworks Facility In Singapore
Calgon Carbon Corporation (Calgon Carbon or the Company) announced recently that the Company and Sanli M&E Engineering Pte Ltd (Chye Joo-Sanli Joint Venture) have signed a contract for the supply of 2.9 million pounds of Calgon Carbon’s GAC for process upgrading at Choa Chu Kang Waterworks in Singapore






Calgon Carbon Signs Water Treatment Contracts Valued At $3.5M For Removal Of PFOS
Calgon Carbon Corporation (Calgon Carbon or the Company) announced today that it has signed contracts for a total value of $3.5M, under which the Company will provide granular activated carbon (GAC) and associated equipment systems to the city of Newburgh, NY.









PFOA Task Force - Calgon Carbon Corporation
Behind the terrifying headlines of contaminated water exists an effective, affordable solution. No one wants to be without drinking water, yet many communities around the country are being told their water is unsafe. Watch this video to learn more.









Granular Activated Carbon: A Long-Term Solution For Meeting DPB Compliance
When the Cobb County-Marietta Water Authority (CCMWA) anticipated the need to upgrade the Hugh A. Wyckoff water treatment plant, they turned to granular activated carbon (GAC) technology after vetting several alternatives. The plant, a wholesaler in a two-plant system, processes up to 72 million gallons per day and serves about 350,000 people. Comprising of Wyckoff and the James E. Quarles treatment plant, CCMWA is the second largest water provider in Georgia.









Calgon Carbon Activated Carbon Video
As a leading manufacturer of activated carbon, with broad capabilities in ultraviolet light disinfection, Calgon Carbon provides purification solutions for drinking water, wastewater, pollution abatement, and a variety of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes. This animation takes you through the process of manufacturing activated carbon.









Carbon Adsorption & Reactivation
Chemical, petrochemical, and oil-reﬁning plants are process-intensive operations with regulatory requirements to protect the surrounding water and air from the effects of industrial pollution. These external demands are matched by equally compelling internal pressures to address product puriﬁcation needs, ﬁnd alternatives to utilizing costly fresh water in production processes, reduce the carbon footprint, and operate efficiently and proﬁtably.









Calgon Carbon Reactivation Video
After an activated carbon’s adsorptive capacity has been exhausted, it can be returned to Calgon Carbon for thermal reactivation. With high temperature reactivation followed by off-gas treatment, the adsorbed organic compounds are destroyed and reactivated carbon can be safely and cost-effectively recycled back to facilities for continued use.









Emerging Contaminants: PFOS AND PFOA
PFCS are manmade fully fluorinated compounds which are not naturally found in the environment, are used in a variety of products such as fire fighting foams, coating additives as a surface-activeagent. PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) and PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) are the most commonly produced PFCs, and large amounts of PFCs have been produced during past manufacturing processes and released to the air, soil and water.









Switch From Virgin To Reactivated Carbon Reduces Municipality’s Water Treatment Costs
					The Town of Guilderland and its water treatment plant are located in east-central New York, approximately 7 miles northwest of Albany, and about 125 miles north of New York City. In 2010, officials for the Guilderland Water District authorized a full-scale pilot program to determine the impact on cost and water quality associated with using reactivated carbon as a filtration media instead of virgin granular activated carbon.

				








Carbon Adsorption & Reactivation: Turning Obligation Into Opportunity In The Chemical Process Industry
Chemical, petrochemical, and oil-refining plants are process-intensive operations with regulatory requirements to protect the surrounding water and air from the effects of industrial pollution. By Robert Deithorn, Product Market Director, Calgon Carbon Corporation

Big Brand Water Filter offers a complete range of medias for all type of water treatment applicaions.  We have coal carbon for taste, odor and color reduction.  Coconut shell carbon for total trihalomethane (thm) and disinfection byproduct reduction (dbp).  We have water softener resin in 8% cross link for standard applications and 10% crosslink for applications requiring chlorine tolerant resin.  We have well water media for pH correction, iron, manganese and hydrogen sulfide reduction.  We have specialty resins for tannins, arsenic, nitrates, dealkalization and deionization.

 



Sub-Categories









Carbon - Taste, Odor, Color and Chlorine Reduction











Water Softener Resin

Water Softener Resin can be regenerated with either potassium chloride or sodium chloride salt.  There is a misconception in the marketplace that certain water softeners are specifically designed for use with potassium salt to be more environmentally correct.  This is a fallacy.  All water softeners using a cation exchange resin can use either salt.  Typically it requires about 10% more salt to regenerate with potassium chloride salt when compared to sodium chloride salt.  The advantage of potassium salt is that it does not contribute to a high sodium diet and the backwash can be discharges onto a lawn or garden.  Sodium chloride salt will kill plants so it must be discharged into a sewer system.  USA made resins are made with sulfuric acid to sulfonate the resin versus imported resins that use a solvent based process.  Both produce a good resin but the USA made resin won't have the solvent residue on startup that will be experienced with the imported resins.  Newer 10% crosslink resins claim to have more resistance to breakdown from chlorine.  There is some debate within the industry as to how much extra resin life will be obtained through use of the 10% crosslink water softener resins.









Iron, Manganese and Hydrogen Sulfide Reduction

Iron, Manganese and Hydrogen Sulfide Reduction 









KDF Media

KDF Fluid Treatment, Inc. manufactures two product lines of its distinctive, high-purity, granulated media: KDF® 55 Process Medium and KDF® 85 Process Medium, each with its own KDF®-F (Fines) version.  KDF 55 Medium was designed specifically for removing or reducing chlorine and water-soluble heavy metals. It controls scale, bacteria and algae, even in hot water.  KDF 85 Medium removes or reduces iron and hydrogen sulfide from municipal or other water supplies. Also controls scale, bacteria and algae.










MultiMedia Filtration

Multi-Media Filters are generally comprised of layer of media including Filter-Ag, Sand, Garnet, and Gravel.









pH Correction Media

The two most popular pH correction medias for home water treatment are calcite and corosex.  Calcite is limestone and offers one primary advantage.  You cannot overtreat your water with calcite.  Calcite will correct pH to a 7.2-7.4 range without overcorrecting and causing high pH spikes.  calcite is ideal for pH levels as low as 6.0  When pH levels are below 6.0 calcite generally will not provide enough pH correction and that is where corosex comes into use.  Corosex causes aggressive pH correction in these low pH conditions.  Corosex can overcorrect pH so it must be used with caution.  Generally we start with a media tank with 100-200 lbs of calcite, then add corosex in small amounts of 2-10 lbs at a time until the ideal pH level is reached.  When the water sits with little or no flow for extended period corosex even in small quantites can overcorrect which is why we use so little media.









Specialty Medias

Specialty Medias are used for a variety of applications including nitrate reduction, tannin reduction, deionization and other water purification processes.

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]

History[edit]
Formation and government contract (1940s-1950s)[edit]
Calgon Carbon Corporation was founded as the Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Initially the company manufactured products such as coke fuel in support of the local steel industry. Owned in part by the Pittsburgh "steel tycoon" J. Hartwell Hillman, Jr.,[8] in 1940 the company began operating a manufacturing plant on Neville Island.[4] The United States government commissioned Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical to develop a new filtering agent for use in military gas masks in 1942. At the time coconut shells were typically used as the raw material to produce granular activated carbon (GAC) for mask filters, and Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical instead began producing a GAC product with bituminous coal.[6]
The 1952 steel strike led to the company coming under the auspices of Harry Truman's controversial and short-lived Executive Order 10340, which ordered that steel industry facilities could be seized by the government to support the Korean War effort. Over a dozen other companies in Pittsburgh were affected by the order as well.[9] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced their "Pittsburgh pulse bed" system in 1955, which was one of the first activated carbon systems to decolorize sugar.[6] In 1956, Fortune Magazine ranked Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical as No. 488 on the Fortune 500, which lists fastest-growing US companies.[10]
Pittsburgh Activated Carbon (1960s-1980s)[edit]
The company's activated carbon division developed new water treatment methods in 1960, and two years later the division installed 40,000 pounds of their carbon for the Virginia-American Water Co, a notable contract for the company. Also in the early 1960s the company began using their granular activated carbon (GAC) for removing tastes and odors.[6]
In the early 1960s the Neville Island facility became the formation site of Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company, the next evolution of the company. In 1965 the Calgon Corporation acquired Pittsburgh Activated Carbon.[4] When Calgon Corporation was restructured in 1967 and split into six autonomous divisions, the Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company division began operating its own marketing and manufacturing. Calgon Corporation was then acquired by Merck & Co. in 1968.[6] In the late 1960s Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Company became increasingly involved with municipal drinking water treatment, and in 1970 the company's European marketing branch Chemviron opened headquarters in Brussels. Calgon Corporation formed a joint venture with Mitsui Chemicals and Mitsui & Co in 1978, branching into Japan.[6]
Going public (1980s-1990s)[edit]
As of 1985, Calgon Carbon was operating as a subsidiary of Merck and Co. However, that year Calgon Carbon's management purchased their own company from Merck and Co in a leveraged buyout. Calgon Carbon made an initial public offering of common stock in 1987.[6] Around 1990 the company came out with an "advanced UV oxidation process to remediate contaminated groundwater," and three years later Thames Water, a large utilities company in the United Kingdom, granted Calgon Carbon exclusive rights to market technology that cleaned organic compounds such as pesticides out of drinking water.[6]
Calgon Carbon was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991,[6] and throughout the 1990s it bought a number of subsidiaries, with Calgon Carbon's executive Colin Bailey overseeing many of the acquisitions.[11] In 1996 it purchased the various operations of Vulcan Peroxidation Systems in Arizona and Solarchem Enterprises in Ontario, both of which produce perox-pure. Also that year Calgon Carbon acquired Advanced Separation Technologies in Florida and Charcoal Cloth (International) in Britain, the latter of which manufactures activated carbon in cloth form.[6]
In 1997 Calgon Carbon Asia was formed as a marketing subsidiary in Singapore, serving much of Asia, India, Australia and New Zealand.[6] Calgon Carbon Corporation's CEO resigned in February 1998, reportedly over differences with the board of directors over company direction, and Calgon Carbon hired the firm Morgan Stanley for advice on a possible company sale.[11] Also in 1998, the company developed a process to inactivate pathogens such as Cryptosporidium in drinking water, using UV disinfection. At that point the company launched two new products: ISEP for perchlorate removal using a continuous ion exchange system, and Sentinel UV Disinfection System, a disinfectant for pathogens.[6]
UV products and expansion (2000-2013)[edit]
In 2002 the company opened a manufacturing plant in China. The company also formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to manufacture and market products in Japan. Waterlink Specialty Products (Sutcliffe Speakman in Europe and Barnebey Sutcliffe in the United States) was acquired in 2004. Calgon Carbon entered in a joint venture with C. Gigantic Carbon (Gigantic) in 2006, forming Calgon Carbon (Thailand) Ltd. to expand into Thailand. In 2007 the company secured its first contract for its FLUEPAC product, a form of powdered activated carbon for treatment of mercury in flue gas streams.[6]
Calgon Carbon acquired the firm Zwicky Denmark and Sweden in 2010, which had long been a distributor for Chemivron Carbon, and Calgon Carbon also purchased the stock of Hyde Marine,[6] a company that manufacturers equipment using filtration and UV disinfection to treat marine ballast water.[12] In 2011, the company formed by the venture of Calgon Carbon and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, called Calgon Carbon Japan KK (CCJ), was fully acquired by Calgon Carbon Corporation. Also in 2011 the company announced a contract with Phoenix, Arizona to provide reactivation services, and Calgon Carbon began construction on a new facility in Arizona.[6]
Randy Dearth became Calgon Carbon's CEO in June 2012, after his predecessor John Stanik retired. Dearth had previously worked at Bayer Corporation and as a CEO of Lanxess Corporation.[13] Also in 2012, Seth Schofield was appointed independent chairman of the board.[6] In May 2013 Dearth announced the company would be working to cut annual expenses by $30 million by the end of 2014. The company, which had recently closed a plant in China, reduced their number of products by 45 percent early in the cost-cutting cycle. Calgon Carbon also did an early retirement program and restructured their business units.[13]
Growth and new headquarters (2013-2015)[edit]
As of September 2013 Calgon Carbon was "one of the top three suppliers of activated carbon for the mercury removal market and supplies 32 electric generating units that produce 14.2 gigawatts of electricity." That summer the EPA's pending Mercury and Air Toxins Standards required all power plants to filter the mercury emitted by burning coal. At the time, the EPA recommended activated carbon as the best available "control technology for mercury removal." Calgon Carbon predicated that when the policies are implemented in April 2015, the demand for activated carbon might double.[14] Calgon Carbon products are distributed by Brenntag Canada in Canada, and in September 2013 they signed a near $30 million contract for Calgon Carbon's FLUEPAC product, which is a powdered activated carbon that can filter mercury.[14]
As of February 2014 the company sold 50 million pounds of GAC annually to municipalities to be used for treatment of drinking water. Continuing to branch into Asia, that month the company signed a contract with DaeWoo Engineering and Construction to supply 5.6 million pounds of GAC to a drinking water plant that provides water for about 600,000 residents in Seoul, South Korea.[15] Also at that time the company signed a 10-year contract to treat drinking water for the Palmdale Water District in California, which serves around 115,000 people.[16]
In late 2012 the stock was around $12 a share, before hovering around $20 in 2014.[13] The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed tariffs in November 2014 on activated carbon imports from China, doubling the average import tax. Calgon Carbon announced it would be affected by fluctuating market prices.[17] In February 2015 the company announced a 10% increase in fourth quarter profits, citing an increased demand for activated carbon for mercury removal and industrial water treatment. After the announcement, shares rose 7%.[12]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon operates fifteen facilities for manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment in the US, Asia, and Europe, and employs around 1,100 people.[2] The European branch Chemviron Carbon continues to be headquartered in Belgium and has production and sales facilities in Europe.[citation needed] In early 2015 the company moved their headquarters from the Pittsburgh suburb of Robinson to nearby Moon Township.[7] The new building combined the main research laboratory and corporate staff, which had previously been in separate facilities.[13]
Products and markets[edit]
Calgon Carbon manufacturers and markets a number of filtration products using either activated carbon,[3] UV light technology, or ion exchange technology. There are products for the purification of air, drinking water, wastewater, foods and beverages, and pharmaceuticals, as well as odor control and "pollution abatement."[6] Other products treat or purify landfill leachate, sweeteners, glycerin, and cigarette smoke.[3]
The company also provides granular activated carbon and activated carbon cloth for the production of respirators and "personal protection apparel,"[2] and powdered activated carbon for energy storage products such as batteries and what it calls "ultra capacitors." Various forms of carbon are used for residential water filtration, pond and aquarium cleaning, and removal of impurities during the manufacturing process of vitamins. The company also serves "industrial processes" applications such as liquid chemicals, catalyst support, gas and water processing, ultrapure water, and bio-based chemicals.[3]
Activated carbon[edit]
Activated carbon, which is a small form of carbon with a large pore structure that can remove impurities,[13] was one of the first products produced by the company in the 1940s.[6] Initially manufacturing granular activated carbon (GAC), the company also began producing forms such as powdered, pellets, and later cloth.[3] Pittsburgh Coke and Chemical introduced an early activated carbon system to decolorize sugar in 1955, and in the 1960s the company began using GAC for removing tastes and odors.[6]
As of 2015 Calgon Carbon sells over 100 product types that use activated carbon, for what the company claims are for "700 distinct applications,"[2] including the removal of mercury emissions, air treatment in industrial contexts, purifying soda ash and food liquids like high-fructose corn syrup, removing color and odor, and industrial processes for the chemical and petroleum refining industries. Carbon cloth is used for medical purposes including wound care, various defense applications, and diverse industrial products. Activated carbon can be used in respirators and aids in metal recovery in the mining industry.[3] The company began selling FLUEPAC carbon in 2007, which is powdered activated carbon for filtering the mercury "in flue gas streams from coal-fired electric power plants."[6] In 2014 the company began branching into the ultra-capacitor market, using activated carbon in electric storage cells for hybrid vehicles.[13]
Reactivation[edit]
For large municipalities and manufacturing industries that want to reuse their activated carbon, Calgon Carbon has a service wherein they collect used or spent activated carbon (where its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted). The activated carbon is sent to one of Calgon Carbon's facilities and placed in a furnace to burn off and destroy impurities and other adsorbed organic compounds, then recycled back to the customer for continued use.[13]
UV light[edit]
The company became involved with UV light technology in water treatment in the 1990s, coming out with a UV oxidation process to remediate groundwater in 1990. A product marketed as Sentinel UV Disinfection System was released in 1998, with UV being used as a disinfectant in drinking water by inactivating pathogens such as Cryptosporidium. The UV C3 product series for wastewater was later released, as well as a product line called Rayox Treatment System for process water and groundwater. Since 2010 they have also sold products by Hyde Marine, Inc.[6] that use filtration followed by UV disinfection to treat ballast water in ships.[3]
Ion exchange[edit]
In 1998 Calgon Carbon came out with their Ion Separator (ISEP) product line, which uses a continuous ion exchange system to remove perchlorate[6] from water sources, including municipal water. Since then the company has manufactured ion exchange products for applications such as the recovery of precious metals, removal of inorganic compounds like nitrate, food processing, and the purification of amino acids.[3]
