Senior Drivers






 




It is a fact that the majority of traffic accidents include drivers that at opposite ends of the age spectrum. The biggest concern has always been new drivers. Teens will always cause more than their share of accidents because they don't have the experience or maturity to drive with as much care as they should. But, inevitably, time passes and their driving improves. However, that improvement doesn't last forever.
As drivers continue to age sometimes driving skills star to decline. It is up to us as individual drivers to address how we handle our ability to drive a car, van, truck, or SUV. It is important to recognize that older drivers can make adjustments. It probably comes at no surprise that the easiest way to adjust driving habits is to pay greater attention to traffic signs, signals, and speed limits. Obeying posted instructions will decrease the chance that an older driver will have to rely on deteriorating eyesight and slower reflexes to avoid an emergency situation.
Some states have laws that increase requirements for older drivers to renew their driving privileges. However, such requirements, such as shorter licensing periods and mandatory driving tests don't occur until drivers are well past 70 years of age. It makes more sense for drivers to change their habits as well as look for ways to objectively assess their current driving skills. Mature drivers should consider the following:
Consider restricting driving to non-peak hours whenever practicalAvoid driving in poorer weatherAvoid driving at nightBe aware of how any prescription medicines may affect vehicle operationVoluntarily take driving tests so an objective party can evaluate skillsSearch websites, such as those sponsored by state motor vehicle departments, senior associations, or driving clubs which offer self-assessment questionnairesReduce distractions while driving; choose minimal or no use of cell phones, audio devices, etc.Be more sensitive to feelings of fatigue and don't drive while tiredWhen circumstances call for it, consider giving up your license and depend on other means of transportation
