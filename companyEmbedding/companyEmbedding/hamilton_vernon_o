Stunning, Art Deco-inspired modern -day watch
















Verified Purchase


I strongly recommend this watch for people who want an Art Deco style watch but do not want to take the gamble on buying a vintage watch of questionable condition. This is a stunning, classy-looking, eye-catching watch! It will stand out clearly from the run-of-the-mill faux-diver's watches that seem to be everywhere and on every wrist. It combines cool 1920's-retro design with modern automatic self-winding technology. Very good value. You will not find a more distinctive, higher quality watch at this price.
This is my second Hamilton. Please note that the face/dial is quite large, it dwarfs my other watches. It also is quite heavy. It's eye-catching but not ostentatious. Looking at the watch from the edge, you can see that the bezel has a beautiful curve to it. The blue leather band takes a little getting used to, but it is very dark and suitable for casual and dressier occasions. The sweeping second hand is an elegant touch and it looks to me that the hour and minute hands are luminsecent-the numbers on the dial are not. The skeleton "cut-away" back is a nice, though unnecessary touch. The internal workings look a lot cooler and of higher quality than my Seiko Kinetic. This one is a keeper!

Art Deco Americana Timepiece
















Verified Purchase


This terrific slightly oversized tank design watch by Hamilton is terrific as the perfect Art Deco accessory for the office or night out.  The tank design is a throwback to when timepieces were worn with pride by everyone; this one captures that spirit offering a splash with the dark blue leather band.

Mt Vernon Watch
















I have the harder to find chronograph version of this watch and if you want a big watch that is going to attract comments this is it. I was very impressed with the quality and weight of these watches. Hamilton might be owned by SWATCH, now, but this is no plastic watch.

Watch
















Verified Purchase


Great watch and look. The watch is a tad heavy and does slip off the wrist unless the band is tight. Black band was shipped as oppopsed to blue leather band.

I love this watch!!!
















Verified Purchase


This watch is well worth the purchase price. It is a great casual piece for any watch collection. The watch has a very big face, so if you are someone with a small wrist it may be a little overbearing.

It doesn't look very expensive, but it doesn't look cheap. I like it as a casual weekend piece with jeans and a nice top. Definitely not for work, or formal wear.

Brand Story



Hamilton Watches
Brand story
Founded in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1892, Hamilton watches are an American classic. From its Broadway Limited series of pocket watches that became known as the “Watch of Railroad Accuracy,” to the world’s first battery-powered and digital timepieces, Hamilton has made several of the most dramatic changes to the horological landscape. The brand even closed its doors to consumer sales during World War II to provide 1 million timepieces to the American military. Lauded for its accuracy, durability and style, Hamilton has also made its imprint on pop culture, appearing on the wrists of A-list celebs in such Hollywood blockbusters as “Blue Hawaii,” “Men in Black” and “Pearl Harbor.”
