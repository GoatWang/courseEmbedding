I explained that “a large majority of the REITs in the Durable Income Portfolio are what I refer to as the so-called SWANs, or "sleep well at night" REITs. The difference between a SWAN and a non-SWAN is fundamental to the success of the Durable Income Portfolio.” I wrote that “by screening the wide world of REITs using a simple, but tactical, strategy of filtering out anchors/buoys and SWANS/Non-SWANs, the Durable Income Portfolio is positioned to generate the most reliable, stable, and predictable returns.” I added that “my goal is not to be the home run hero, but simply to hit singles, doubles, and an occasional triple... slow and steady always wins the race.” While I strive to invest a large majority of capital into the more stable blue-chip REITs, I am always “seeking alpha” by screening the smaller cap names. It's not surprising to see the dominant index-driven large-cap REITs, but as David Harris with UniPlan explains (in a white paper),    The institutional acceptance over time of new types of property has been a notable development of the public REIT market since the start of the so-called modern REIT era in the early 1990’s. Early investment in some of these new property types has generated attractive returns to those willing to put in the work to understand the potential risks and rewards of unfamiliar property types… We think that many of these non-traditional REITs continue to offer above average return prospects, provided they can demonstrate being a long-term source of fairly stable income growth that investors associate with the established property types. 
 Harris went on to explain that “a substantive part of the attractive returns that has been generated by REITs related to this acceptance of new property types we believe is attributable to a compression (decline) in cap rates over time." In a simple example shown below, UniPlan illustrates the increase in value that accrues from a decline in the cap rate from upper single digits (more typical of a non-traditional property type) to a more institutional core asset like cap rate of 6%. For the sake of simplicity, UniPlan chose to include no increase in net income. At the property level, a 300bps decline in cap rates results in a 50% increase in the property asset value. Moreover, such an investment, if financed by 50% debt, would produce a doubling of the equity value. (Note that 50% leverage is higher than generally employed by a public REIT – which is typically 35-40% – but lower than might be used by a private/institutional investor – usually up to 65-70%.) Self-storage properties are among those sectors that have experienced this dramatic increase in value from declining cap rates over the last few years. 

 As investors become more familiar with a new property type and develop a better sense of risk, they may find reason to reduce their assessment of risk, and that may prompt an upward revaluation of the property (and hence a lowered cap rate). The tradeoff for investing in large-cap more traditional REITs can be easily traced back to the institutional buyers, led by exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that have a higher degree of analyst coverage and much lower risk tolerances. Conversely, the small-cap REITs lack the same Wall Street coverage and investor interest which can result in shares remaining undervalued, especially in down markets for extended periods of time.
 So, these under-analyzed small-cap REITs flying under the radar can offer better potential for growth over the long term. Due to decreased institutional support, there's a better chance that small-cap REITs will have lower valuations that result in an underestimation of a company's operational health and prospects for growth. Collectively, small-cap REITs have always been viewed as more risky bets than large-caps, and although they don't have the diverse revenue streams or stable cash flows as the big boys, they are complementary to my overall dividend growth model. As a key ingredient for my Durable Income portfolio, the small-cap REITs create a buoy effect as they are more susceptible to wide swings (by Mr. Market) in price due to lower trading volumes - a key attribute since greater volatility deters action and often invites selling. 

 (Source) My Small-Cap REIT Portfolio  Each month in my newsletter (Forbes Real Estate Investor), I provide subscribers with a portfolio of Small-Cap REITs. As you can see below, this portfolio consists of 18 REITs ranging from $190 million market capitalization to $2.7 billion. 

 I have written on these REITs, and for quick reference, you can click on the REITs at the end of this article to obtain my latest research. As noted above, many small-cap REITs achieve multiple expansion as they increase in size, and as viewed below, most small-cap REITs are trading at a discount to their peer average:
 

 You can also see that these REITs have dividend yields higher than their peers: 

 Year to date, I have been pleased with the results of the Small-Cap REIT Portfolio. The good news is that the portfolio includes just one retail REIT, Whitestone REIT (NYSEMKT:WSR), and there is sound diversification across property sectors and sub-sectors. 

 As you can see, Farmland Partners (FPI) has been the worst performer, but I am encouraged by the latest earnings results. Yesterday, in a press release, FPI’s CEO, Paul Pittman, explained, “This was a quarter marked by healthy year-over-year AFFO per share growth. Our second quarter 2017 results are more indicative of our ongoing operations as compared to the first quarter of 2017, which included the closing of the AFCO merger and related integration activities during the quarter.” I plan to write a detailed article on FPI later today. In summary, I have found excellent opportunities canvassing the universe of small-cap REITs. While I would not recommend owning just one or two names, I believe that owning shares in smaller REITs offers a compelling risk/reward thesis. As Davis Harris writes,
    These new property types have drivers of space demand that can differ from other established property types and supply characteristics that can also vary. This can give rise to different performance at various times over the economic/property cycle. Several large companies we regard as non-traditional property owners, have become REITs over recent years such as cell tower companies - American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle International (CCI); datacenter company Equinix (EQIX); timber company, Weyerhaeuser (WY); and paper storage company, Iron Mountain (IRM)... We believe that many of these new entrants will challenge the understanding of investors but they will likely continue to offer the prospect of above-average returns ahead of a revaluation.

Whitestone REIT: Tantalizing 9% Dividend Yield Appears Covered, But High Debt Is A Lingering Concern - Whitestone REIT (NYSEMKT:WSR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Whitestone REIT: Tantalizing 9% Dividend Yield Appears Covered, But High Debt Is A Lingering ConcernJul.18.17 | About: Whitestone REIT (WSR) Sure Dividend Long-term horizon, newsletter provider, dividend investing, High Quality DividendsSure Dividend (High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks)Published by Bob Ciura on July 17th, 2017 Real Estate Investment Trusts are popular investments among income investors, for obvious reasons. They are required to pass along the vast majority of their earnings in order to retain a favorable tax structure, which results in some eye-popping yields across the REIT asset class. You can see all 173 publicly-traded REITs here. For example, Whitestone REIT (NYSEMKT:WSR) has a 9% dividend yield, which is more than four times the average dividend yield in the S&P 500 Index. It is one of 405 stocks with a 5%+ dividend yield. You can see the full list of established 5%+ yielding stocks here. Not only does it have a very high dividend yield but it also makes its payments each month. You can see the entire list of all 34 monthly dividend stocks here. Stocks with such extremely high yields can also carry significant risk. As a result, it is critical for investors to make sure the high dividend payouts are sustainable over the long term. This article will discuss Whitestone's business model, and whether its dividend is covered by sufficient cash flow. Business Overview Whitestone is a commercial REIT. Its properties are located primarily in the South:  Phoenix (50% of operating profit) Houston (20% of operating profit) San Antonio/Austin (20% of operating profit) Dallas (9% of operating profit) Chicago (1% of operating profit)  Whitestone's focused strategy is a competitive advantage. It primarily invests in destination centers, such as grocery stores, retail outlets, banks, restaurants, and many more. As of March 31st, 2017, Whitestone's portfolio consisted of 69 properties, with over 1,500 tenants. It has a solid occupancy rate of 89%. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 17
 Whitestone believes its investment properties are "e-commerce resistant" because they are go-to destinations that provide needed or necessary centers. Moreover, the company believes these are products and services that are not readily available online. And, these properties are located in densely-populated, high-income areas, which are experiencing strong growth. Not only does Whitestone expect its properties to benefit from population growth, but from household income growth as well. According to the company, household growth within a three-mile radius is likely to exceed 8% per year over the next five years. Furthermore, households within a three-mile radius are expected to generate income growth of approximately 7.8% per year over the same time. The neighborhoods it invests in have an average household income of over $75,000, well above the industry average of approximately $62,000. This focus has served the company, and its shareholders, very well. Whitestone has racked up very high growth rates for the past seven years. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 23 Since Whitestone's initial public offering in August 2010, its revenue and funds from operation have grown by 23% and 32% per year, respectively. Going forward, the company will continue its acquisition strategy to fuel future growth. Growth Prospects Acquisitions are a key piece of Whitestone's growth strategy. The company abides by several acquisition criteria before purchasing a property. First, it seeks to find visible properties in well-established, high-income areas. The properties are typically 50,000-200,000 square feet. And, the properties must have potential for increasing rents and renovation potential, and may also feature vacant land to build on.
 It also will invest in distressed properties, whose maturity has passed with a high likelihood that it will not be refinanced. Purchasing non-performing assets allows Whitestone to buy valuable properties on the cheap, which it can redevelop and earn a sizable rate of return. It completed two major acquisitions to start 2017, BLVD Place and Eldorado Plaza, both located in Texas. Acquisitions have generated strong growth for Whitestone since its IPO, but growth has leveled off in recent years. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 6 It finances these acquisitions with a mix of internally generated cash flow, as well as external equity and debt issuances. In 2016, Whitestone grew revenue by 12%. Net profit rose 18% and FFO increased 10%. FFO, or Funds From Operation, is a non-GAAP measure typically utilized by REITs to express cash flow available for distributions. FFO-per-share declined fractionally from the previous year due to higher shares outstanding. But the company remained solidly profitable, with FFO-per-share of $1.34. FFO-per-share declined again in the first quarter. Revenue increased 11%, but FFO-per-share declined 5.8% year over year. Fortunately, Whitestone expects FFO-per-share in a range of $1.34-$1.39 per share for 2017, which would represent a return to growth on a per-share basis. Dividend Analysis Whitestone has obvious appeal for income investors because of its very high dividend yield. That said, it is also important to assess a REIT's ability to pay its dividend, especially with such high-yielding stocks like Whitestone. For the first quarter of 2017, Whitestone had a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 8.8, which is high. The good news is, management intends to reduce the ratio to 7.0 over the next one to two years. The bad news is, this is still a fairly high debt level, which means further work needs to be done.
 The company generates enough cash flow to pay its dividend for now, thanks to a sufficient coverage ratio. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 28 Whitestone's 2016 core FFO of $1.34 per share fully covers its annualized dividend of $1.14 per share. If the company can continue growing FFO moving forward, it will strengthen its dividend coverage. Another piece of good news is that approximately 64% of Whitestone's debt is fixed-rate, with a manageable weighted average interest rate of 4%. This will help blunt the impact of rising interest rates moving forward. Its mortgage debt averages just $7.7 million in maturities over the next three years. It has ample short-term liquidity, with over $100 million in an unused credit revolver, along with $6.5 million in cash. However, the longer-term picture is much cloudier. Whitestone is facing approximately $278 million in total maturities in 2020. If the company can grow FFO-per-share, it could withstand its long-term maturities. Still, investors should keep an eye on Whitestone's financial results in subsequent quarters to confirm its debt reduction strategy is still intact. Final Thoughts The old saying 'high risk, high reward' seems to apply to Whitestone. While the stock has a tantalizingly high dividend yield, it is not without risk. The current dividend payout looks sustainable for now and over the next few years. Whether the dividend can be maintained over the long term remains to be seen. If everything goes according to plan, Whitestone could be an attractive stock for investors looking for income right now, such as retirees. Whitestone has not raised its dividend since its IPO in 2010, meaning it is not as attractive for dividend growth investors.
 As a result, the decision whether to buy Whitestone stock may come down to the investor's time horizon and level of risk aversion.About this article:ExpandTagged: Dividends & Income, REITs, Financial, REIT - DiversifiedWant to share your opinion on this article?

Whitestone REIT: Tantalizing 9% Dividend Yield Appears Covered, But High Debt Is A Lingering Concern - Whitestone REIT (NYSEMKT:WSR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Whitestone REIT: Tantalizing 9% Dividend Yield Appears Covered, But High Debt Is A Lingering ConcernJul.18.17 | About: Whitestone REIT (WSR) Sure Dividend Long-term horizon, newsletter provider, dividend investing, High Quality DividendsSure Dividend (High Quality Dividend Growth Stocks)Published by Bob Ciura on July 17th, 2017 Real Estate Investment Trusts are popular investments among income investors, for obvious reasons. They are required to pass along the vast majority of their earnings in order to retain a favorable tax structure, which results in some eye-popping yields across the REIT asset class. You can see all 173 publicly-traded REITs here. For example, Whitestone REIT (NYSEMKT:WSR) has a 9% dividend yield, which is more than four times the average dividend yield in the S&P 500 Index. It is one of 405 stocks with a 5%+ dividend yield. You can see the full list of established 5%+ yielding stocks here. Not only does it have a very high dividend yield but it also makes its payments each month. You can see the entire list of all 34 monthly dividend stocks here. Stocks with such extremely high yields can also carry significant risk. As a result, it is critical for investors to make sure the high dividend payouts are sustainable over the long term. This article will discuss Whitestone's business model, and whether its dividend is covered by sufficient cash flow. Business Overview Whitestone is a commercial REIT. Its properties are located primarily in the South:  Phoenix (50% of operating profit) Houston (20% of operating profit) San Antonio/Austin (20% of operating profit) Dallas (9% of operating profit) Chicago (1% of operating profit)  Whitestone's focused strategy is a competitive advantage. It primarily invests in destination centers, such as grocery stores, retail outlets, banks, restaurants, and many more. As of March 31st, 2017, Whitestone's portfolio consisted of 69 properties, with over 1,500 tenants. It has a solid occupancy rate of 89%. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 17
 Whitestone believes its investment properties are "e-commerce resistant" because they are go-to destinations that provide needed or necessary centers. Moreover, the company believes these are products and services that are not readily available online. And, these properties are located in densely-populated, high-income areas, which are experiencing strong growth. Not only does Whitestone expect its properties to benefit from population growth, but from household income growth as well. According to the company, household growth within a three-mile radius is likely to exceed 8% per year over the next five years. Furthermore, households within a three-mile radius are expected to generate income growth of approximately 7.8% per year over the same time. The neighborhoods it invests in have an average household income of over $75,000, well above the industry average of approximately $62,000. This focus has served the company, and its shareholders, very well. Whitestone has racked up very high growth rates for the past seven years. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 23 Since Whitestone's initial public offering in August 2010, its revenue and funds from operation have grown by 23% and 32% per year, respectively. Going forward, the company will continue its acquisition strategy to fuel future growth. Growth Prospects Acquisitions are a key piece of Whitestone's growth strategy. The company abides by several acquisition criteria before purchasing a property. First, it seeks to find visible properties in well-established, high-income areas. The properties are typically 50,000-200,000 square feet. And, the properties must have potential for increasing rents and renovation potential, and may also feature vacant land to build on.
 It also will invest in distressed properties, whose maturity has passed with a high likelihood that it will not be refinanced. Purchasing non-performing assets allows Whitestone to buy valuable properties on the cheap, which it can redevelop and earn a sizable rate of return. It completed two major acquisitions to start 2017, BLVD Place and Eldorado Plaza, both located in Texas. Acquisitions have generated strong growth for Whitestone since its IPO, but growth has leveled off in recent years. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 6 It finances these acquisitions with a mix of internally generated cash flow, as well as external equity and debt issuances. In 2016, Whitestone grew revenue by 12%. Net profit rose 18% and FFO increased 10%. FFO, or Funds From Operation, is a non-GAAP measure typically utilized by REITs to express cash flow available for distributions. FFO-per-share declined fractionally from the previous year due to higher shares outstanding. But the company remained solidly profitable, with FFO-per-share of $1.34. FFO-per-share declined again in the first quarter. Revenue increased 11%, but FFO-per-share declined 5.8% year over year. Fortunately, Whitestone expects FFO-per-share in a range of $1.34-$1.39 per share for 2017, which would represent a return to growth on a per-share basis. Dividend Analysis Whitestone has obvious appeal for income investors because of its very high dividend yield. That said, it is also important to assess a REIT's ability to pay its dividend, especially with such high-yielding stocks like Whitestone. For the first quarter of 2017, Whitestone had a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 8.8, which is high. The good news is, management intends to reduce the ratio to 7.0 over the next one to two years. The bad news is, this is still a fairly high debt level, which means further work needs to be done.
 The company generates enough cash flow to pay its dividend for now, thanks to a sufficient coverage ratio. 

 Source: June 2017 Investor Presentation, page 28 Whitestone's 2016 core FFO of $1.34 per share fully covers its annualized dividend of $1.14 per share. If the company can continue growing FFO moving forward, it will strengthen its dividend coverage. Another piece of good news is that approximately 64% of Whitestone's debt is fixed-rate, with a manageable weighted average interest rate of 4%. This will help blunt the impact of rising interest rates moving forward. Its mortgage debt averages just $7.7 million in maturities over the next three years. It has ample short-term liquidity, with over $100 million in an unused credit revolver, along with $6.5 million in cash. However, the longer-term picture is much cloudier. Whitestone is facing approximately $278 million in total maturities in 2020. If the company can grow FFO-per-share, it could withstand its long-term maturities. Still, investors should keep an eye on Whitestone's financial results in subsequent quarters to confirm its debt reduction strategy is still intact. Final Thoughts The old saying 'high risk, high reward' seems to apply to Whitestone. While the stock has a tantalizingly high dividend yield, it is not without risk. The current dividend payout looks sustainable for now and over the next few years. Whether the dividend can be maintained over the long term remains to be seen. If everything goes according to plan, Whitestone could be an attractive stock for investors looking for income right now, such as retirees. Whitestone has not raised its dividend since its IPO in 2010, meaning it is not as attractive for dividend growth investors.
 As a result, the decision whether to buy Whitestone stock may come down to the investor's time horizon and level of risk aversion.About this article:ExpandTagged: Dividends & Income, REITs, Financial, REIT - DiversifiedWant to share your opinion on this article?

Whitestone REIT to buy Uptown's BLVD Place

1 / 3


Back to Gallery
















A Houston real estate investment trust is making a mammoth acquisition of two Texas properties, including BLVD Place, the Whole Foods-anchored shopping and office complex on Post Oak Boulevard.
Whitestone REIT, owner of community shopping centers primarily in Texas and Arizona, said Wednesday that it will spend $204.6 million for the posh Uptown property, along with Eldorado Plaza in the Dallas suburb of McKinney.



The sale of BLVD Place is the latest blockbuster deal involving one of Houston's high-profile mixed-use developments.
Earlier this year the owner of the iconic Greenway Plaza and neighboring Phoenix Tower announced plans to sell nearly half of its interest in those properties to a group of institutional investors for $512.1 million.

Last summer, JPMorgan Asset Management acquired River Oaks District, an upscale development home to some of Houston's top luxury retail brands, for more than $550 million.
The acquisition of the 216,944-square-foot BLVD Place will come with 1.43 acres of land where Whitestone plans to build a six-story building with 46,000 square feet of retail space on the first two floors and 91,000 square feet of office space on the top four. The company estimates the development cost will be $45 million. Whitestone officials could not be reached Wednesday.
Jason Gaines, a senior vice president with NAI Partners, said real estate investment trusts have been eyeing urban, high-end assets — sometimes referred to as "core plus" — to add to their portfolios.
"These inner-city mixed use deals are pretty coveted," Gaines said. "It's a strong play for them."
RELATED: Upscale rumble is ahead in Uptown
Just down from the Galleria at the corner of San Felipe and Post Oak, BLVD Place is owned by a fund managed by Bailard of Foster City, Calif. The project's developer, Ed Wulfe of Houston-based Wulfe & Co., said the company is under a confidentiality agreement and that no deal had been finalized. Bailard could not be reached.
The first phase of BLVD Place was completed in 2009. In 2012, Apache Corp. acquired about six acres of the land to build a new office tower, but has yet to build anything on it.
Gaines said Bailard is likely selling BLVD Place because it was always its intention to do so or it was part of an investment fund that has run its course.
"It's not any sort of distress," he said.
Whitestone noted in announcing the deal that average household income within a five-mile radius of both BLVD Place and the McKinney property is $124,000.
In its announcement Wednesday afternoon, Whitestone said it is negotiating financing terms with potential lenders to fund a portion of the BLVD Place purchase price with $80 million in mortgage financing.
In McKinney, El Dorado Plaza is home to national companies and regional branch offices, including Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Pizza Hut, Hilton Hotels, NexBank, iHeart Communications and Mary Kay Cosmetics.
The property contains 221,577 square feet of space, and Whitestone will have the option to purchase an additional 1.86 acres of land that would allow it to build approximately 24,000 square feet of additional space. Eldorado Plaza is 97 percent leased, and Whitestone expects to fund a portion of the purchase price with borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility.
Both properties are expected to close next month.
Whitesone, which was founded in 1998 and had its initial public offering in 2010, owned 55 properties as of the end of 2016. The company, formerly was known as Hartman Commercial Properties REIT, made $8.1 million last year on revenue of $104.4 million.
The BLVD Place acquisition is Whitestone's 28th property in the Houston region.
Whitestone stock closed at $14.25 Wednesday, down 15 cents, before the deal was announced. The company also said it is offering 8.1 million shares.
Proceeds will be used to repay a portion of the company's debt under a revolving line of credit that will then allow Whitestone to borrow to fund a portion of its pending acquisitions.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
