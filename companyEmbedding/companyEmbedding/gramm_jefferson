          Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism
        

    By 
      Jefferson Gramm, Jeff Gramm, Jeff Gramm



A sharp and illuminating history of one of capitalism's longest running tensions--the conflicts of interest among public company directors, managers, and shareholders--told through entertaining case studies and original letters from some of our most legendary and controversial investors and activists.Recent disputes between shareholders and major corporations, including Apple and DuPont, have made headlines. But the struggle between management and those who own stock has been going on for nearly a century. Mixing never-before-published and rare, original letters from Wall Street icons--including Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Ross Perot, Carl Icahn, and Daniel Loeb--with masterful scholarship and professional insight, Dear Chairman traces the rise in shareholder activism from the 1920s to today, and provides an invaluable and unprecedented perspective on what it means to be a public company, including how they work and who is really in control.Jeff Gramm analyzes different eras and pivotal boardroom battles from the last century to understand the factors that have caused shareholders and management to collide. Throughout, he uses the letters to show how investors interact with directors and managers, how they think about their target companies, and how they plan to profit. Each is a fascinating example of capitalism at work told through the voices of its most colorful, influential participants.A hedge fund manager and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, Gramm has spent as much time evaluating CEOs and directors as he has trying to understand and value businesses. He has seen public companies that are poorly run, and some that willfully disenfranchise their shareholders. While he pays tribute to the ingenuity of public company investors, Gramm also exposes examples of shareholder activism at its very worst, when hedge funds engineer stealthy land-grabs at the expense of a company's long term prospects. Ultimately, he provides a thorough, much-needed understanding of the public company/shareholder relationship for investors, managers, and everyone concerned with the future of capitalism.





                  REVIEW QUOTES
            

The letters give insight into how shareholder activism can both benefit and harm companies. Gramm s findings will intrigue and inform history buffs and activist shareholders alike. --Publishers Weekly"
Jeff Gramm has a refreshing approach to the generations-long conflict between entrenched corporate management and shareholder activists. Gramm illustrates this seemingly never ending struggle for corporate control by examining specific well known and surprisingly interesting examples. Dear Chairman is an engaging and worthwhile read. ---Alan Greenspan, Former Chairman of the Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System"

Board - USA / Can., Board Listed/Public Companies


– USA, WA – Ambassadors Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EPAX), a leading provider of educational travel experiences and online education research materials, held its annual stockholders meeting today. The slate of seven directors, recommended by the board of directors, was elected to serve for the upcoming year. Two new directors joined the board: Jefferson Gramm, a principal at Bandera Partners, LLC, and Philip B. Livingston, former Chief Executive Officer, LexisNexis Web Based Marketing Solutions. Bandera Partners owns approximately 18% of the Company’s outstanding shares.
Following the stockholders meeting, the board of directors met and elected Lisa O’Dell Rapuano to serve as its Chairman. Rapuano is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lane Five Capital Management LP, a long-biased, concentrated, valuation-driven investment partnership. She was first elected to the board in 2012 and has served on the compensation and nominating committees. Rapuano graduated from Yale University and holds a Chartered Financial Analyst professional designation. Rapuano’s status as representative of one the Company’s largest stockholders gives her important perspective as board Chair.
“Our board is committed to creating value for our stockholders and maximizing the opportunities for improvement in the business. We continue to believe we offer a great product in the market and will accelerate our transition to a more efficient cost structure and marketing approach,” said Rapuano.
The board also appointed Philip Livingston to serve as the Company’s new Interim Chief Executive Officer.  Livingston was previously the Chief Executive Officer of LexisNexis Web Based Marketing Solutions from 2009 to 2013.  He has previously served on numerous boards of directors and his management experience includes President and CEO of Financial Executives International, CFO of Catalina Marketing Corporation, and CFO of Celestial Seasoning Inc. He graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park and holds an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. Livingston replaces Anthony F. Dombrowik, who will be pursuing opportunities outside of the Company.
“The board would like to thank Mr. Dombrowik for his years of service to the company and wishes him well in his future business endeavors,” said Rapuano.
“The People to People brand is strong in the marketplace and our associates are clearly dedicated to the mission of education and exchange toward creating global citizens. We will be focused on customer-centrism, cost efficiency, and web-based services integration, all toward constantly improving our business,” said Livingston.
