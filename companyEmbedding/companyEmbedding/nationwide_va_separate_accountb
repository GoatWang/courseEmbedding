Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

	2. The

	Legal Proceedings

	section of your prospectus is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:


	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.

Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:
No.Old fundOld classNVIT New fundNew class1American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.—American Century VP Value Fund (“Old Value Fund”)Class INVIT—American Century NVIT Multi Cap Value Fund (“New Multi Cap Value Fund”)Class I2Old Value FundClass IINew Multi Cap Value FundClass II3Fidelity Variable Insurance Products (“VIP”) Fund—VIP Contrafund Portfolio (“Old Contrafund Portfolio”)Initial ClassNVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (“New Large Cap Growth Fund”)Class I4Old Contrafund PortfolioService ClassNew Large Cap Growth FundClass I5Old Contrafund PortfolioService Class 2New Large Cap Growth FundClass II6Fidelity VIP Fund—VIP Growth Opportunities Portfolio (“Old Growth Opps.

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Start Printed Page 66808Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and Start Printed Page 66809New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the Start Printed Page 66810necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio Start Printed Page 66811securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management pursuant to delegated authority.
Florence E. Harmon,
Deputy Secretary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Following is a summary of the application. 
The complete application may be obtained for a fee form the SEC's 
Public Reference Branch.

Applicants' Representations

    1. NWL and NWLAIC are stock life insurance companies incorporated 
under Ohio law. NWLAIC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWL.
    2. The NWL Accounts were established by NWL, and the NWLAIC 
Accounts by NWLAIC, to fund certain group or individual deferred 
variable annuity contracts, including the contracts described in the 
application the (``Subject Contracts''). The first Subject Contract 
(``Subject Contract No. 1'') is funded through the Nationwide Variable 
Account. The second Subject Contract (``Subject Contract No. 2'') is 
funded through Nationwide VA Separate Account-B. The third Subject 
Contract (``Subject Contract No. 3'') is funded through Nationwide 
Fidelity Advisory Variable Account.
    3. The Existing Accounts are registered with the SEC as unit 
investment trusts under the Act. Applicants request that the relief 
sought herein extent to all future separate accounts (``Future 
Accounts''; together with the Existing Accounts, the ``Separate 
Accounts'') which may be established by NWL or NWLAIC for the purpose 
of funding the Subject Contracts and any contracts established by NWL 
or NWLAIC in the future which will be substantially similar in all 
material respects to Subject Contracts Nos. 1, 2, or 3 (``Future 
Contracts;'' together with the Subject Contracts, the ``Contracts''). 
Future Contracts established under any Existing Account will be offered 
as separate classes of securities under that Existing Account. The 
Contracts shall be registered as securities under the Securities Act of 
1933.
    4. The Contracts may be sold as non-tax qualified contracts or as 
Individual Retirement Annuities qualifying for special tax treatment 
under section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 
``Code''). The Contracts also may be sold as tax-qualified contracts 
purchased and used in connection with retirement plans under section 
401 of the Code, or as tax-sheltered annuities under section 403(b) of 
the Code. Certain Contracts may qualify for special tax treatment under 
section 408(a) of the Code.
    5. Fidelity, a registered broker-dealer under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, Inc. (the ``NASD''), is the principal underwriter 
for Contracts funded through the Nationwide Fidelity Advisor Variable 
Account. NFS, a registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and a member of the NASD, is the principal underwriter for 
Contracts funded through the Nationwide Variable Account and the 
Nationwide VA Separate Account-B. Applicants request that the relief 
sought herein extend to any other broker-dealer and NASD member which 
may serve as the principal underwriter for the Contracts.
    6. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to the 
Separate Accounts and, through a number of subaccounts, will be 
invested in shares of various mutual funds, as specified in the 
application. The minimum initial purchase payment for Subject Contracts 
Nos. 1, and 2 is $15,000. Subsequent purchase payments, if any, must be 
at least $5,000 each under Subject Contract No. 1, and at least $1,000 
each under Subject Contract No. 2. The minimum initial purchase payment 
for Subject Contract No. 3 is $5,000. Subsequent purchase payments, if 
any, must be at least $1,000 each. Future Contracts may have greater or 
lesser minimum initial and subsequent purchase payments.
    7. At any time prior to annuitization, the Contract owner may 
select one of three annuity payment options, each of which provides for 
a series of annuity payments commencing on the annuitization date. Each 
Contract also provides for a death benefit if the annuitant dies during 
the accumulation period. The death benefit, if the annuitant dies prior 
to the annuitization date, and prior to his or her eighty-sixth 
birthday, is the greater of: (a) The sum of all purchase payments made 
under the Contract less any amounts surrendered, (b) the sum of the 
value of all Separate Account accumulation units attributable to the 
Contract plus any amount held under the Contract in the general account 
of the Companies (the ``Contract Value''), or (c) the Contract Value as 
of the most recent five-year Contract anniversary, less any amounts 
surrendered since such anniversary. If the annuitant dies after the 
annuitization date, the death benefit (if any) will be as specified 
under the annuity payment option elected. If the annuitant dies after 
his or her eighty-sixth birthday, the death benefit is limited to the 
Contract Value.
    8. The Companies will charge against the Contract Value the amount 
of any premium taxes levied by a state or any other governmental entity 
upon purchase payments received by the company. Premium tax rates 
currently range from approximately 0% to 3.5%. The Companies currently 
deduct such charges from a Contract owner's Contract Value either: (i) 
At the time the Contract is surrendered, (ii) at annuitization, or 
(iii) in those states that so require, at the time purchase payments 
are made to the Contract.
    9. The Companies permit unlimited transfers among the funds under 
each of the Subject Contracts. No fees or charges are currently imposed 
for such transfers. The Companies, however, reserve the right to impose 
a maximum fee of $10 per transfer under Future Contracts.
    10. The Companies deduct, during both the accumulation and 
annuitization periods, administration charges of 0.15% (for Subject 
Contract No. 1) and 0.20% (for Subject Contract No. 2) of the daily net 
assets of the Nationwide Variable Account and Nationwide VA Separate 
Account-B, respectively. NWL does not assess any administration charge 
with respect to Subject Contract No. 3. The administration charge is an 
amount not greater than expenses without profit actually incurred and 
directly attributable to services provided by NWL and NWLAIC, 
respectively. The Companies assess the administration charges in 
reliance on rule 26a-1 of the Act and may, with respect to Future 
Contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects to 
either Subject Contract No. 1 or Subject Contract No. 2, assess 
administration charges greater than those imposed under Subject 
Contracts Nos. 1 and 2. Any such 

[[Page 53227]]
administration charges will be assessed in accordance with rule 26a-
1(b), and the Companies shall monitor the proceeds of the 
administration charge, and other similar administrative or contract 
maintenance charges, including any transfer fee, to ensure that they do 
not exceed expenses without profit. Applicants represent that any 
administrative charge, contract maintenance charge, or transfer fee 
shall not be increased during the life of a Contract. The Companies 
believe that the administration charges will yield an amount 
considerably less than the Companies' current and projected 
administrative costs.
    11. No sales charge is deducted from purchase payments made under 
the Contracts. However, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') 
may be assessed by NWL or NWLAIC if part or all of the Contract Value 
is withdrawn. Currently, a CDSC is only imposed under Subject Contract 
No. 1. The CDSC is calculated by multiplying the purchase payments that 
are withdrawn by a percentage, according to the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 CDSC   
Number of completed years from the date of purchase payment   percentage
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0..........................................................            7
1..........................................................            6
2..........................................................            5
3..........................................................            4
4..........................................................            3
5..........................................................            2
6..........................................................            1
7..........................................................            0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of imposing the CDSC, purchase payments are considered to 
be withdrawn on a first-in, first-out basis, and purchase payments are 
considered to be withdrawn before earnings thereon. Applicants believe 
that the proceeds from the imposition of the CDSC may not be sufficient 
to cover all sales expenses. With respect to Future Contracts 
substantially similar in all material respects to Subject Contract No. 
1, applicants reserve the right to impose a CDSC up to 9%, in 
accordance with rule 6c-8(b)(1).
    12. Under Subject Contract No. 1, each Contract year the annuitant 
may withdraw, without the imposition of a CDSC, an amount equal to 10% 
of the total sum of all purchase payments made up to the time of 
withdrawal, less any purchase payments previously withdrawn that were 
subject to the CDSC. The CDSC-free withdrawal privilege also may be 
exercised pursuant to a systematic withdrawal program, under which the 
annuitant may withdraw each Contract year, without the imposition of a 
CDSC, an amount up to the greater of (a) 10% of the total sum of all 
purchase payments made up to the time of withdrawal, less any purchase 
payments previously withdrawn (the ``10% Withdrawal Privilege''), or 
(b) the specified percentage of the Contract Value based on the 
annuitant's age, as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Percentage 
                      Annuitant's age                        of contract
                                                                value   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under 59-\1/2\............................................             5
59-\1/2\ to 70\1/2\.......................................             7
70-\1/2\ to 75............................................             9
75 and over...............................................            13
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If total amounts withdrawn in any Contract year exceed the CDSC-free 
amount as calculated in connection with the systematic withdrawal 
privilege, the annuitant may only withdraw, without the imposition of a 
CDSC, an amount equal to the 10% Withdrawal Privilege. The annuitant 
may elect to withdraw such CDSC-free amounts only once each Contract 
year.
    13. The Companies intend to assess mortality and expense risk 
charges against the assets of the Separate Accounts. The aggregate 
mortality and expense risk charges are equal (for Subject Contracts 
Nos. 1 and 2), on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the net asset value of 
the Separate Accounts. Of this amount, 0.80% is attributable to 
mortality risks, and 0.45% is attributable to expense risks. With 
respect to Subject Contract No. 3, NWL assesses a mortality risk charge 
equal, on an annual basis, to 0.80% of the net asset value of the 
Separate Accounts, and does not assess an expense risk charge. With 
respect to Future Contracts, the Companies reserve the right to assess 
a maximum mortality risk charge of 0.95% of the daily net assets of the 
Separate Accounts associated with Future Contracts, subject to 
obtaining an appropriate SEC order. The mortality and expense risk 
charges are guaranteed not to increase for the duration of a Contract.
    14. The mortality risk the Companies assume is twofold: (a) the 
annuity risk of guaranteeing to make monthly payments for the lifetime 
of the annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant may live, and (b) 
assuming the risk of a guaranteed minimum death benefit. The annuity 
risk is present in the form of annuity purchase rates that are 
guaranteed at issue for the life of the Contract. There is also the 
risk that the average life expectancy of the entire population may grow 
longer. The Companies assume an expense risk in connection with their 
guarantee that they will not increase annual contract charges 
regardless of actual expenses incurred.
    15. If the mortality and expense risk charges are insufficient to 
cover the actual costs of the mortality and expense risks, the loss 
will be borne by the Companies. Conversely, if the mortality and 
expense risk charges prove more than sufficient, the expense will be a 
profit to the Companies. In such a situation, the profit will become 
part of the general account surplus of either NWL or NWLAIC, depending 
on which is the issuing company, and may be used to compensate each 
Company for unrecovered distribution expenses.

Applicant's Legal Analysis

    1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act 
from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act to permit the 
deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the 
Separate Accounts under the Contracts.
    2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), in relevant part, prohibit a 
principle underwriter for, or depositor of, a registered unit 
investment trust from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless 
the proceeds of all payments, other than sales loads, on such 
certificates are deposited with a qualified trustee or custodian, 
within the meaning of section 26(a)(1), and are held under arrangements 
that prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter 
except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for 
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally 
performed by the trustee or custodian. The Companies' deduction of 
mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the Separate 
Accounts may be deemed to be a payment prohibited by sections 
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2).
    3. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon 
application, to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption 
from any provision of the Act, or any rule or regulation promulgated 
thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection 
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and 
provisions of the Act.
    4. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) to permit the issuance of Contracts subject to 
the proposed mortality and expense risk charges. Applicants believe 
that the proposed mortality and expense risk charges on the Subject 
Contracts and 

[[Page 53228]]
any Future Contracts funded through Existing or Future Accounts meet 
the standards of sections 6(c). Applicants believe that any future 
request for relief with respect to any Future Contract would be 
substantively and materially the same as the relief sought herein. 
Applicants believe that the requested relief would eliminate the need 
for the filing of redundant exemptive applications or amendments, 
thereby reducing administrative expenses, maximizing efficient use of 
resources and, thus, promoting competitiveness in the variable annuity 
market. The delay and expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief 
would impair the Companies' ability to take advantage of business 
opportunities as they arise.
    5. The Companies believe that the level of the mortality and 
expense risk charges is within the range of industry practice for 
comparable annuity products and is reasonable in relation to the risks 
assumed under the Contracts. This representation is based upon the 
Companies' analysis of publicly available information regarding other 
insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar 
products. The Companies will maintain at their administrative offices, 
made available to the SEC upon request, memoranda setting forth in 
detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and 
results of, their comparative review.
    6. The Companies represent that, in connection with Future 
Contracts (substantially similar in all material respects to Subject 
Contracts Nos. 1 and 2 if a mortality and expense risk charge is 
imposed; Subject Contract No. 3 if only a mortality risk charge is 
imposed), any mortality and expense risk charges assessed shall be 
within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products 
and shall be reasonable in relation to the risks assumed under the 
Contracts. This representation will be based upon the Companies' 
analysis of publicly available information regarding other insurance 
companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products. 
The Companies will maintain at their administrative offices, made 
available to the SEC upon request, memoranda setting forth in detail 
the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results 
of, their comparative review.
    7. The Companies believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that 
this distribution financing arrangement will benefit Existing Accounts 
and Contract owners. The basis of this conclusion is set forth in 
memoranda maintained by the Companies at their administrative offices, 
made available to the SEC upon its request.
    8. Applicants represent that, with respect to Future Contracts that 
shall be substantially similar in all material respects to Subject 
Contracts Nos. 1, 2, or 3, the Companies shall determine that there is 
a reasonable likelihood that this distribution financing arrangement 
will benefit Future or Existing Accounts and Future Contract owners. 
The basis of this conclusion will be set forth in memoranda maintained 
by the Companies at their administrative offices, made available to the 
SEC upon its request.
    9. Applicants represent that investments of the Separate Accounts 
will be made only in investment companies that, if they adopt any 
distribution financing plan under rule 12b-1 under the Act, will have 
such plan formulated and approved by the investment companies' boards 
of trustees or directors, the majority of which will not be 
``interested persons'' as defined in the Act.

Conclusion

    For the reasons set forth above, applicants believe that the 
requested exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest 
and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary.
