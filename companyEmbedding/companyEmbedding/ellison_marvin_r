With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Marvin Ellison.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Thank you, Trent. Good morning, everyone.
For Q1, we delivered sales comps down 3.5%. This disappointing top line result was in large part due to a very difficult month of February. Although we're less than pleased with the overall top line sales result for the first quarter, we were encouraged by the positive comp performance achieved in April. Our comp performance during the nine-week March and April period improved approximately 600 basis points versus February.
In our earlier earnings release, we announced our plans to maintain our annual guidance of down 1% to up 1%. This decision was based on the Q4 to Q1 sales improvements in women's apparel, which we'll discuss more in a moment; the company's positive comp performance in April; and our investments in Sephora and our home refresh categories, including appliances. As we celebrate our 115-year anniversary as a company, I'd like to thank our associates at all levels for their hard work and commitment in the first quarter of this year.

Now, I'd like to briefly summarize a few of the financial results from the first quarter. While the quarter proved to be challenging on the top line, we continued to make great progress on improving the company's financial condition. Ed will discuss this in more detail in a moment.
Now, let me discuss our all-important apparel business. As you know, it is critical for us to improve the performance of the apparel segment of our business. And although our overall apparel business struggled in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the strong customer response to our Now Trending items in women's. We're pleased with our sales performance in active apparel and our dress business. Improvements in these apparel categories bode well for the balance of 2017, as these items become a much larger piece of our business moving forward.
Even in the face of difficult top line for the first quarter, our new growth initiatives delivered another quarter of strong performance and positive comps, particularly appliances, in-home custom window, mattresses, furniture, Sephora, Salon, activewear and Fine Jewelry. All of these businesses are expected to deliver even greater benefits for the remainder of 2017.
In addition, we recently held grand openings with 16 new Sephora locations in May with plans to open another 16 Sephora locations in the month of June. We're also in the process of rolling out 100 new appliance showrooms this month, as well as rebranding an additional 50 of our salons to Salon by InStyle.
Fine Jewelry had a strong quarter delivering positive comps. Our Fine Jewelry performance is a classic example of great alignment between the merchants and the stores. The merchants have done an outstanding job of selecting inspiring product at a value, and the store team delivered outstanding product knowledge training and customer engagement.
Now, let's discuss in more detail the results of the first quarter sales and gross margin performance. All apparel categories, men's, kids' and women's, performed below the company comp for the quarter. Although sales in women's apparel remained challenged throughout most of the quarter, it did deliver much improved results in the combined March and April periods versus February. Women's apparel also delivered the best comp trend improvement from Q4 of last year to Q1. Broadly speaking, we're pleased that our new apparel strategy, highlighting inspiring trends at a value, performed well in the casual and contemporary categories of women. Now, we must build on the success in the entire women's division, and expand the same philosophy and process to kids' and other apparel areas.
We are also pleased with our gross margin performance for the first quarter. Although we face gross margin pressure from continued growth in dot-com and our 500 appliance showrooms, we were able to deliver a 10 basis points improvement in gross margin. Admittedly, we have a lot of work to do to deliver sustained gross margin improvement for the balance of 2017. However, this gives us confidence that our focus on pricing analytics, store operations, supply chain, merchandising systems are beginning to reap benefits for the company.
With that, let me turn it over to Ed to provide more detail on the first quarter, our balance sheet, and capital market activities.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Thank you, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.
As Marvin said, first quarter proved challenging on the top line, but we continue to improve the company's financial condition through significant debt retirement, selling our Buena Park distribution center, and our recently announced tender offers. I plan to cover our first quarter results and discuss the financial opportunities we have in 2017. I'll recap what we achieved in the capital markets this quarter, and discuss our initiatives to further improve financial condition by deleveraging our debt position. And I'll end with a review of our first quarter balance sheet and our financial guidance for 2017, which we reaffirmed earlier this morning.

Turning to the first quarter results, comparable store sales declined 3.5% for the first quarter. For the combined March and April periods, comp sales improved significantly versus February. Units per transaction and average unit retail were up versus last year's first quarter, while transaction counts were down. Geographically, the Southwest and Southeast were the best-performing regions of the country, and the Northeast was our worst-performing region.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 36.3% of sales, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by improved selling margins for the quarter, partially offset by the continued growth of the company's online and major appliance businesses.
We have considerable gross margin opportunities in 2017, and we are well underway with many of the initiatives we laid out in our last call. We are already seeing benefits in such areas as pricing analytics, modernizing our replenishment processes and systems, and improving the profitability of our private brands through design, sourcing and speed-to-market initiatives. We continue to optimize our supply chain network, including the recent sale and future relocation of our Buena Park supply chain facility. Also, in conjunction with the 138 store closures, we plan to close our Lakeland, Florida, distribution center, and redirect residual operations to our Atlanta facility.
We expect these gross margin initiatives will enable us to offset the expected pressures from our growing appliances and online businesses, and drive gross margin into the guided range of up 20 basis points to 40 basis points for the year.
Moving now to expenses, SG&A expenses for the quarter declined $29 million compared to the same period last year. The savings were primarily driven by marketing, store controllable costs, and incentive compensation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses de-levered 20 basis points. For the first quarter, we drove 170 basis point improvement in our private label credit penetration to 40.4%. We continue to make progress driving our credit penetration, and we expect to end the year with a penetration rate of approximately 42%.
As a reminder, we will start the liquidation process later this month for the majority of the 138 stores we previously announced disclosing. We expect approximately an 80 basis point impact to our gross margin in the second quarter as we liquidate these locations. This expectation is included in our gross margin guidance for the year. As expected, we recorded approximately $96 million in asset impairment and severance-related charges during the first quarter associated with these store closures. In addition, we expect to record an estimated $65 million in charges primarily associated with the present value of the remaining lease obligations on these stores later this year, with the majority of these charges being recorded in the third quarter.
While our overall sales results for the quarter were below our expectations, our performance improved in the combined March and April period versus February. And we continue to effectively manage the business by delivering improved gross margins and maintaining our focus on expense management.
Let's now turn to our liquidity position and capital structure. We are very pleased with the recent upgrades from S&P to raise our credit rating one notch to B+ and confirmed the positive outlook. Clearly, this upgrade demonstrates that credit rating agencies continue to recognize the progress we've made with our deleveraging efforts, and the strategic initiatives we have in place to continue driving sustainable growth and profitability, and improve our overall financial condition.
In Q1, we completed the sale of our Buena Park distribution facility for a net sales price of approximately $131 million. The sale of this facility resulted in a gain of approximately $111 million in the first quarter.

Looking at our debt reduction initiatives since the start of the year, we continue to improve our capital structure by strengthening our balance sheet through significant debt reductions. In April, we utilized available cash on hand to retire at maturity approximately $220 million of the 2017 outstanding bonds, which lowered our annualized interest expense by approximately $17 million.
Additionally, and as previously announced earlier this week, we launched cash tender offers to purchase up to $300 million aggregate principal amount of two outstanding series of securities. A cap has been placed on the 2018 outstanding bonds to tender up to $75 million in principal, with the balance of the tender offer focused on the outstanding bonds due in 2019. The retirement of these bonds is expected to contribute annualized interest expense savings of approximately $23 million. We are utilizing the proceeds received from the sale of the home office last year to primarily fund the tender offer.
Given our debt reduction initiatives, we expect our 2017 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3 times by the end of this year. This is down from 3.7 times at the end of 2016 and 5.4 times at the end of 2015.
Let's move now to cash and inventory. As I stated earlier, we are using cash on hand to retire $220 million of bonds that matured in April. We ended the first quarter with approximately $363 million of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our ABL. As such, our liquidity position at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.4 billion.
Capital expenditures net of landlord allowances in the quarter were $75 million, an increase of $39 million over the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter, free cash flow was a use of $293 million, an improvement of $128 million versus the same period last year. As a reminder, we continue to expect to generate between $300 million and $400 million in free cash flow in 2017. This full-year range includes the expected cash impacts from our store closings and charges related to our voluntary early retirement program, as well as expected proceeds from the sale of operating assets.
Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $2.949 billion, up 0.8% from last year's first quarter, and was in line with our expectations. Approximately 300 basis points of the increase was driven by inventory investments in floor samples for major appliance showrooms and higher inventory levels to support our continued investment in new Sephora shops. We are prudently managing our inventory levels and are pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Our teams remain committed to reducing inventory levels where appropriate throughout the remainder of this year. And we expect total inventory at the end of 2017 to be down at least 5% versus the end of 2016.
Merchandise accounts payable was $893 million, down $102 million from the end of the first quarter last year. The decline was primarily due to reduced purchases in the first quarter.
We have reaffirmed our financial guidance for the full year of 2017. As a reminder, 2017 is a 53-week year, the impact of which has been incorporated into our guidance. We expect the 53rd week is worth approximately 120 basis points on total sales, while comparable store sales are on a 52-week basis. In addition, the following guidance incorporates the impact of our store closures discussed earlier.
For fiscal 2017, comparable store sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1%. Gross margin is expected to be up 20 to 40 basis points versus last year. SG&A dollars are expected to be down 1% to 2% versus last year. And adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.65.
In closing, although we faced a tough top line this quarter given the challenging environment, we continue to manage the business well through executing on gross margin opportunities, exercising SG&A discipline, controlling inventory levels, and deleveraging our debt position. Our teams remain committed to delivering on our 2017 full-year guidance.

With that, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Marvin.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Ed. And while we remain focused on our strategic framework of private brands, omnichannel, and increasing revenue per customer, I'd like to discuss the key growth initiatives that give us confidence in our 2017 financial plan.
First, our beauty categories continue to deliver significant comp growth. The key component of our beauty strategy is our best-in-class partnership with Sephora. As a reminder, we currently operate 588 Sephora inside JCPenney shops and will open 70 new locations in 2017, ending the year with nearly 650 locations. At that time, we'll have Sephora shops in approximately 75% of our stores. Year to date, we're also expanding 24 existing Sephora, growing each location by nearly 50%, to accommodate more products and client services. We're hiring over 800 beauty consultants in 2017, who are a key component of our Sephora inside JCPenney experience.
Another component of our beauty strategy is Salon. JCPenney's Salon business once again drove positive comps for the quarter, and we continue to see benefits from rebranding to Salon by InStyle. We recently announced plans to rebrand 50 more of our salons to InStyle and hire nearly 4,000 skilled stylists who will help us to create even more reasons for customers to visit our improved salons. Our Salon customers shop our stores over eight times a year, so we see Salon as a tremendous customer acquisition strategy. The unique experiences we're able to create for our customers in store through our Salon and our Sephora growth initiatives are hard to replicate online and magnify the importance of a physical store.
Second, our Home refresh initiatives continue to provide strong results. We delivered positive comps in our Home division for the first quarter. Appliance sales both in-store and online continue to drive significant comp sales growth and improve productivity in our Home store. We added new higher-margin take-with categories in our appliance department such as microwaves and mini-refrigerators, as we continue to round out our assortment. We're also leveraging this performance by opening approximately 100 new appliance showrooms in the second quarter and adding new brand partners to the showroom throughout 2017.
As some of you may have read and seen, we're conducting several tests within our Home store focused on home services programs. With the resurgence of the housing market, consumers are spending over $300 billion annually to upgrade their homes, since nearly two-thirds of the nation's homes are over 30 years old. The programs we're testing will provide turnkey services for heating and cooling systems, simple bathroom remodels, home water treatment systems, and quick ship-and-install blinds.
Look, we understand that we'll never be number one in market share in these categories. However, with 70% of our customers being female and over 70% of our customers owning homes, we feel it's prudent for us to try to position ourselves to gain a piece of the $300 billion market opportunity.
And third, we remain committed to becoming a world-class omnichannel retailer. We continue to see significant increase in our online SKU growth, and we plan to continue the SKU expansion throughout 2017. We're also expanding our ship-from-store fulfillment strategy from approximately 250 stores today to 100% of our store network. This means that approximately 875 stores will have the ability to fulfill online orders, which will nearly quadruple the available inventory for sale online. This will also significantly expand the fulfillment capacity of our company, and reduce the last-mile cost of online fulfillment. We're launching this new process in the second quarter.

Our investments and our focus on omnichannel are working. Throughout 2016, approximately 77% of all online orders touched a physical store, and this number continued to grow in the first quarter. So as we improve site functionality, enhance our ship-from-store capabilities, and develop a much improved mobile app, we continue to drive increased online revenue in 2017.
And lastly, we'll continue to improve and strategically adjust our apparel categories. Areas where we are excited to see improvements in 2017 are, number one, active wear for the entire family. As previously announced, we're enhancing our partnership with Nike by leveraging over 600 new Nike store environments to offer a vastly improved assortment of apparel, accessories, and footwear across all divisions. We're also expanding one of the hottest brands right now, adidas. We added women's adidas apparel to 100 stores in March and saw much improved sales. And we're excited to expand this adidas presentation to over 400 stores for back-to-school.
Footwear will also be a focus for us in 2017. We transitioned to an open sale concept in 2015 in only 375 of our women's shoe areas. Given the outstanding performance of the open sale environment, we're in the process of converting all women's shoe areas to open sale fixtures this year. We also introduced new styles and comfort features in order to seize available market share in footwear.
In closing, my optimism on the future of JCPenney is, in large part, due to the fact that we're still playing catch-up to many of our competitors. As we improve our in-store environment and modernize systems like pricing and omnichannel, we see immediate benefits. Therefore, we know the upside for profit and revenue exist. We simply have to move faster. In addition, we believe we've developed a series of very specific growth initiatives that serve the needs of our value-oriented customer, and provides us with differentiation from our traditional competitors.
And with that, Kaley, we'll open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Just wanted to get a little bit more clarification on category performance, Marvin. You discussed women's apparel showcasing some sequential improvement. What specifically was the comp performance of women's apparel? And how are stores with appliances performing versus stores without it? Thank you.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, Paul, our optimism on women's apparel really stems through the performance of the casual and contemporary categories. That was a tough business for us last year. And we had a spring launch with the Now Trending concept that really resonated with our customers extremely well. And in many cases, we sold out a product, and we're now reordering for additional launches in the summer. So, John Tighe, our Chief Merchant, is here in the room. So I'm going to let John provide a little bit more color on why we're excited about the specific categories of women's apparel.
Relative to appliances, appliance stores performed better because appliances had a significant impact to the overall comp. The good news for us is that Q1 is our lowest appliance penetrated month. So we're going to see almost double the comp impact of appliances going into the second quarter, because of patriotic holidays. So we remain very excited about appliances, but I'm going to let John talk to you about the optimism of our spring launch and why we think that's going to help us to get these categories online for summer as well. John?
John Tighe - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Good morning. This is John Tighe, the Chief Merchant. As we moved into March, we really leveraged the design capabilities of our talented organization of product development and design and leveraged our international sourcing to deliver great trends at a great value. And the customer really responded. It was terrific alignment with the stores organization, with the marketing organization and the merchants to pull this together. And really, it moved the performance of women's apparel, and improved half of the loss we had in the fourth quarter. It was an improvement for March and April. So, we are excited to expand that and use that as our future model for success, and expanding it not just in women's apparel, but around the rest of the store.

Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. And just want to also get clarification on EBITDA guidance for this year. You reiterating the $1.1 billion, and is there any additional real estate or asset sales that are to be included in that?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Paul, this is Ed. I'll take that. Well, technically, we haven't given EBITDA guidance, but it's implicit in our EPS guidance. And as we stated in fourth quarter, the midpoint is about a $1.1 billion EBITDA. We also stated we expected sales of operating assets to be north of $100 million. Obviously, the Buena Park was at $111 million. So that came in at the high end of our range. We're still working on a few other transactions, probably one significant one that will close in the fourth quarter. So we think there's upside to that sale of operating asset estimate we gave. We're not upping our guidance right now. Obviously, we just had a very challenging quarter in a very challenging environment, but our hope is that some of that flows through as upside as we get through the year.
Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And last one, very quickly, Marvin, are you willing to comment at all about trends more recently over the last few weeks? And how you're kicking off the second quarter?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Paul, we try not to get into inter-quarter updates. But what I will tell you is that a fact that we are holding our annual guidance is a reflection that we have confidence that the initiatives that we've talked about are starting to reap some of the dividends that we hoped.
And more importantly, we talked in the prepared comments about our margin improvement. And although 10 basis points may not appear to be significant, when you factor in that we are going against 500 new appliance showrooms and pretty rapid dot-com growth, which are margin rate dilutive, the fact that we can deliver 10 basis points of improvement, while having significant reductions in inventory, gives us confidence that some of the pricing analytics and supply chain improvements and store operations, merchandising systems are paying off. So although I won't give you specifics on how we're trending this quarter, I will tell you that we're confident that our initiatives will allow us to have a successful year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley. Your line is open
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Good morning. Just kind of a follow-up on apparel to start with, maybe you can talk a little bit more about what you're doing to drive sustainable improvement in the private label part of women's apparel, particularly in terms of speed to market. And then also if you could touch on inventory in apparel at the end of the quarter, how you're planning to manage inventory in apparel into Q2 and Q3? And then also, separately, if you could speak a little bit about how you're thinking about monetizing additional real estate? And what we should expect over the next year or so in terms of real estate sales or sale-leasebacks? Thanks.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Okay. Jeff, I will take the first part of the women's apparel question. And I'll hand it back to our Chief Merchant, John Tighe, to provide some additional color. One of the first things that we had to do was really accelerate the design, sourcing to sales floor part of our business for private brands. And we're pleased with the improvements we made in gross margin in private brands. We're also pleased with the fact that for a large percent of our private brands, we actually cut 40% of the supply chain time out, meaning that we were able to get these goods from design to the physical sales floor 40% faster. And that was driven by a great partnership with the merchants, the supply chain sourcing team, the design team and the stores.

One of the reasons why we're able to be nimble in the changes we've made in women's apparel in contemporary and casual was primarily because of that speed initiative. I'll give it to John, and let John talk about the benefits of that and how we see that new process driving success for the remainder of the year. And then, I'll hand it to Ed to let him talk about inventory and potential real estate monetization going forward. John?
John Tighe - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Marvin. This is John. Last year, we reorganized our whole process for product development and design; and in some areas, reduced it by over 40% from where we were. This is allowing us to be much faster to market and be more trend-right and allowing us to really deliver the right trend and value at the timely basis. We continue to use this as we move through the year, and get better at it, and will allow us to reorder and be more nimble with the reaction to the customer.
We also did lots of consumer research last year in better understanding our customer to align our assortment with her needs. And really what she told us is that she's more casual – and I think everyone realizes that casualization of America continues to expand – and that she loves activewear. So, as we go and scan for trend and value by leveraging our design and product development teams, we'll also lean into casual and active to grow our business.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Okay. Ed?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Good morning, Jeff. On the inventory question, as we said, our inventory is up 0.8% at the end of the first quarter. The investments – incremental investments we made in showrooms for appliances and the additional Sephora stores were worth over 300 basis points. So, apparel inventory was down at the end of Q1. And as we move forward, we expect the end of the year to be down over 5%. We would still expect that incremental 300 basis points or so for additional showrooms and Sephora. So we're expecting apparel inventories to be down high-single digits by the end of the year. And we would expect it to be a continual step-down each quarter between now and then.
As far as real estate sales, we continue to look at our assets. And if they're worth more to – as real estate as they are to us for stores, we continue to look to try to and make deals there. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to have one of those deals later this year. And we think there's probably a handful of stores that that may apply to. And we'll continue to look at that and see if it makes sense for us. Although I don't expect it to be hundreds of millions of dollars go forward, I do think there continues to be opportunity for us to monetize some assets.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you, good morning. What were first quarter apparel comps? And where do you need them to get to for the remainder of the year to hit that minus 1% to plus 1% comp guidance?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
For the quarter, overall apparel performed worse than the company comp. I think that's probably the best way to illustrate the overall performance. And candidly, as we look at our sales plan and our guidance of down 1% to plus 1%, apparel is obviously planned down. So we have no great optimism that we're going to swing apparel to positive comps overall. There are categories in apparel, active being one, dresses and some components of contemporary and casual that we are expecting to see positive comps in. But overall, we have apparel planned down appropriately.

So if we can hit a plan which is a modest plan of negative comps for apparel and continue to see the growth trajectory that we discussed in categories like Home and Appliances and Sephora and Salon and Fine Jewelry and all of those other growth areas, including omni, we think we are well within our range for guidance.
But we're going to work very hard and we have stretch targets, but those stretch targets won't get us in trouble from an inventory standpoint. And we're in a good position because of the speed initiative John talked about that we can be nimble, and we can make decisions with a lot more data. But overall, we're just going to continue to work on it, but we're not overly optimistic that we're going to swing it to positive.
Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then it sounds like there will be some gross margin pressure in the second quarter, but what you're seeing quarter to date, you still feel confident that the second quarter comps can be within your guided range?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Yes, and the gross margin pressure, as Ed mentioned, is primarily coming from the liquidation in our closed stores. When you separate the closed store inventory liquidation, we see the go-forward stores as being margin accretive. We expect and plan margin growth.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. So if we broke down the comps a little further, so versus the negative 3.5%, what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then just how did private label comps versus national brands?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Matt, this is Ed. I'll take the second part first. Private brands out-comped national brands for the quarter. We had a really great quarter in private brands. As we said, margin was up 10 basis points. Margin significantly improved in private brands in Q1, as our sourcing initiatives are really starting to kick in. So we feel really good about private brands as we move forward. The first part of your question was about...
Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Traffic.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Traffic, yes, so AUR was up slightly for the quarter. UPTs was up low single digits. The rest of the loss came from negative traffic.
Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then just to follow up on the gross margin, so 1Q up 10 basis points, and you walked through the 80 basis point headwind in 2Q. Can you just walk through the drivers of the back half gross margin build to bridge to that full year up 20 to 40 basis points?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
And just to be clear, there is 80 basis points of pressure in Q2 from the closing stores. We're not saying Q2 will be down 80 basis points to last year. We do expect to get some margin accretion, as Marvin just said. We expect fall margins to be up to get us into that range. As I said in my prepared remarks, we continue to see significant benefits from our sourcing initiatives, even though there is raw material pricing pressure. We continue to see average unit cost going down in our sourcing group. Also, our pricing analytics continues to be significantly accretive to the gross margin. And between those two, we expect it to continue to build throughout the year and get us into the margin range.
Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, best of luck.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open.
Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Thanks, guys. You made some comments during the quarter, I think, about some of your stores that are going to be closed are actually going to stay open a little bit longer, and I was just curious. What were the sales that we could attribute to those stores in first quarter results? And I'm just curious. You mentioned the margin pressure for 2Q. What sort of comp impact will those liquidation sales have? And I'm just curious how it impacted the comp and gross margin this quarter as well. Thanks.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, Paul, on the second part of your question, we see zero sales impact for second quarter because we pulled those stores from the comp calculation for Q2. But relative to the comp benefit in Q1, it's almost impossible to calculate because we also had cannibalization that occurred from the closing store sales. So as an example, if we have a closing store in a market with two additional stores, we saw sales dilution in the existing stores because of the traffic in the closing stores. So for us, to give a comp benefit or a negative comp impact is virtually impossible to calculate. What we can calculate is that the closed store performance was margin dilutive to the company just driven by mix. So they hurt margin, but from a sales standpoint it's virtually impossible to determine what the impact was.
Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you, and then just one follow-up. Can you talk about performance at mall locations versus off-mall locations in 1Q? And then I'm also curious if you could talk within malls, performance in A versus B and C centers. Thanks.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Paul, this is Ed. I'll take those. We continue to see off-mall outpace mall. It's a couple hundred basis points for the quarter that we see the off-mall outpace the mall. Within malls, there's really no clear winner. You would expect A and B to be outpacing C and D, and we're seeing them all about the same.
Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the marketing front. Can you just talk a little more about your strategy there for 2017 and any changes going on? I think advertising efficiency has been one of the drivers to SG&A reduction. I'm just wondering if you think you're investing enough in marketing to drive traffic to the stores and website. Clearly, a lot of exciting change is happening in the stores. But with casual foot traffic steadily declining in the mall, just how are you working to get the word out to potential customers?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Mark, it's a very timely question for us because John mentioned that we spent a lot of time doing market and consumer research. And what the research has identified as pretty obvious, we have different customer segmentations. But within those segmentations, they have dramatically different shopping patterns and they have dramatically different desires and habits on how they consume media information.
So we're going to make some shifts in our marketing mix to ensure that we are driving the right marketing media to identify the correct customer for the correct category. We spent a lot of time going through the calendar for the balance of the year, making adjustments. And we feel great about the changes that we'll see relative to shifting from print to social and digital, understanding what are the categories and the customer segments we want to identify via mediums like direct mail, but also leveraging the much improved mobile app as a way to drive awareness and retention.

So, as we think about strategy, we'll see those shifts going to be more customer segment dependent. But relative to do we believe that we have cut too much out of marketing, the short answer is no. As a percent of sales, we outspend all of our competitor on marketing. So we think we are properly funding marketing. We just have to get better at the overall allocation of the spend relative to the segments and the categories that we're trying to drive revenue in.
Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the SG&A side, you've made some nice progress there. With the results in Q1, guidance would suggest that the reductions in SG&A slow for the balance of the year. So can you just talk about how much flexibility you have on that front? Where is there still low-hanging fruit? And then as the store closures you've identified begin to hit the P&L, would you expect to see more significant declines in SG&A dollars in the back half of the year? Just any help with those dynamics would be great. Thank you.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Sure, Mark. This is Ed again. We continue to believe we have opportunity around SG&A. With the store closures moving out, that obviously puts more pressure on there, because a significant piece of our dollar savings were coming out of the closed stores. But with them all being closed at the beginning of Q3, most of the dollar savings in Q3 and Q4 will come out of the closed stores.
But we know we have opportunities around the entire company. We continue to right-size our corporate office. As Marvin talked about, we advertise at a higher percent than most, if not all, of our peers. We know we have opportunities to be more efficient in the stores from how we sign things to how we receive goods. So we're tackling all of that. We know our supply chain has opportunities as well. So we continue to go after all of our SG&A reductions. And hopefully, we think – hopefully, there'll be some upside to the guidance we've given. But we've been conservative with that.
Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.
Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group
Good morning, everyone. As you think about the store closings, what do you see as the cadence of the store closings and the sales recapture rate? How are you planning that? Thank you.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, Dana, on the sales recapture rate, it's something that we're obviously spending a lot of time on. And we think the key for us will be leveraging our e-commerce business, leveraging our loyalty program, and making sure that we understand the one-to-one marketing opportunities that exist even in a market where we don't have a physical store location.
I mentioned earlier the importance of omnichannel. And we think omnichannel is going to be significant for us to maintain that recapture rate and that retention rate. Joe McFarland, our EVP of Stores, is here. And Joe has been leading the closed store efforts. So I'll let Joe kind of talk about the cadence of the store closing process and kind of how we see it for Q2 and where we think we'll kind of have the process concluded when we get to the end of this quarter.
Joseph McFarland - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Thank you, Marvin. Good morning. This is Joe. From a store closing standpoint, on Monday, May 22, we will begin the closing store commencement. The closing store process is approximately nine weeks. And as we begin the commencement, we will have an in-store visual sign package calling out store closing in addition to newspaper ROPs, some direct mail, e-mail, we'll have exterior banners on the store to really drive the awareness. As we move through, we have very specific weeks identified that we will begin that closing sale with a 30% to 50% off, and then move forward from there. We have flexibility with great partnership from our third-party liquidator that we've partnered with. We've got some great analytical tools to drive the decisions that we make and the cadence in which we close the stores. All stores will be closed to the public by Monday, July 31.

Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
And, Dana, this is Ed. Just to chime in, all the stores that go into the liquidation, well, we don't liquidate all 138. There is a handful that will go into fall, based on lease agreements we have.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. I just had a question around the Sephora shops and comp store sales in the stores that have the Sephora shops, like how are they performing versus the rest of the fleet?
And then, the second question I have is, can you talk a little more on mattresses and furniture needs to be called out in department stores? What's happening with those categories is my second question, if you could talk about that. And the third one is, fulfillment costs and shipping costs on the e-commerce side, how much of a drag has that been? And how do you have that forecast in the gross margin expectation for this year? Thank you.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Okay, Bob, look, I'll take the Sephora question and also the fulfillment call. So, on the Sephora, the comps for stores with Sephora shops are up versus stores without. It was one of the key driving factors on identifying stores that would close. We simply did an analysis on capital investment possibilities. And where we had stores performing well were obviously stores with Sephora locations, stores with appliance showrooms, et cetera. And so, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when we finish this year, we're going to have roughly 650 stores with Sephora shops, which will be roughly 75% of all stores.
At that time, we're going to evaluate, which we already are, and look at a combination of new locations and also expanding locations. I mean, we've been exceptionally pleased with the 24 stores this year that we've expanded. And we've expanded, as I mentioned, in some cases, that space by over 50%. And we're seeing expanded sales floor productivity. So it's not diluting productivity, it's actually increasing productivity.
Relative to fulfillment costs, we are very pleased with the fact that we run a supply chain, and we run an online fulfillment process that is cost effective. I would argue that we're probably one of the few retailers that run a profitable e-commerce business. That's in large part due to the excellence of the team, but also the coordination between Mike Amend and also our supply chain leadership team.
Mike Amend is in the room. And if I could, I want Mike just to talk a little bit about the performance of our e-commerce site, specifically that the mobile wallet that we're rolling out on our new mobile app that launched within the last couple of weeks that we're having success with.
Mike, do you want to discuss that for a second?
Michael Amend - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Marvin. So, yes, so we recently launched a mobile app with a wallet capability. And so, in going in stores and talking with customers about opportunities to aid in the shopping experience both with inside of our store and also outside of our store, we recently added this wallet capability. And what this does is this allow us to be able to put both coupons, expose their rewards that they've earned from our loyalty program, as well as that gift cards and other capabilities. And what we believe that this will do is that this will allow customers just a simple one-stop shop access for all of these things that they've earned with JCPenney. And so we're very excited about this. We've seen this with this launch.

We've seen great engagement with our customers and we believe this is going to continue to drive a great opportunity for us to reengage our customers from an ongoing basis, and also help in aiding in the in-store experience on doing a variety of things, whether it'd be picking up their orders, price checking and many more things. So, we're very excited about this, as we move forward.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
And look, on mattresses and furniture, we're very excited. We mentioned that these two categories positive comp in the first quarter. So, I'm going to let John Tighe talk about what our potential growth in these areas are and why we're excited about both categories.
John Tighe - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Hi. This is John. Last year, we reset our mattress floor to be organized by comfort as opposed to by brand. And we reorganized the vendor structure and the assortment. The response has been terrific, as well as our furniture assortment that we readjusted with Ashley's Furniture and private brand. Both businesses are running ahead of plan and beating last year. And we'll be looking to expand into new markets this year to capture share in markets, where closed stores are giving us opportunity to get volume.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, more to come on that, and we'll be talking a lot more about the expansion of the mattress and furniture categories here in the near future.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you.
Michael Amend - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, one other thing – hey, Bob, one other thing that I would add on the online fulfillment, so we are in the process right now of rolling out an intelligent order sourcing, logic capability that is actually live right now for some subs. And as Marvin mentioned earlier, we're moving from around 250 stores doing ship-from-store to chain wide, which will expose another billion dollars of inventory.
And so, what this new system does is, it actually has a real-time optimization functionality that looks at speed, it looks at delivery expense, it looks at labor, it also looks at markdowns in terms of current markdowns and future markdown avoidance. So one of the things that we're doing here is rolling out the system to continue to increase driving reduced cost actually of deliveries, and also heavily leveraging our store footprint to drive ship-to-store capabilities, which will also have a reduced delivery expense because delivering to a commercial location versus a residential location is cheaper, and this also helps us get foot traffic to our stores.
So, a lot more to come here on this capability. But what I'd tell you is, in partnership with Mike Robbins, our EVP of Supply Chain, he and I are working on a number of really great initiatives that are going to continue to reduce our fulfillment expense within our online business.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Great.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Hey, Bob, this is Ed. Just to follow on, while we're really optimistic about being able to drive those costs down going forward, to answer your question directly, in Q1, fulfillment costs were down high-single digits on a per unit basis, so we continue to see significant improvement, even before we get the system support we need.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS. Your line is open.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think as you guys studied your stores for the – like changes you made to your fleet this year, you also started testing smaller format appliance pads or smaller support pads to give you an idea whether those could be put in as comp drivers in some of your smaller stores. Am I right on that? If so, would you mind commenting on that test or those categories that could be a comp driver in the some of the smaller boxes in the future?

Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Michael, you are correct. And we are in the process of testing those initiatives as we speak. We've had early success with some of the smaller footprint Sephora locations. We have seen lines out the door of the mall a block long in some of our rural locations, where we rolled out smaller Sephora locations. And we are now in this 100-store expansion of appliances. We're going to be testing some smaller footprint appliance locations that we're very optimistic will work well for us. Just because we have the extended product selection online, we can serve a customer regardless of the units we have on the sales floor.
I'll let John give you a little bit more color on the Sephora test because that's something that we're very excited about.
John Tighe - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
This is John. Our Sephora expansion has really worked almost anywhere we've done it. And we're really thinking about growing Sephora on two tracks. There's the expanding out to many of our doors, small stores, urban stores, rural stores; it's been working. While we're thinking about expanding, we're also going back and renovating and expanding our flagships. So this year, while we opened 70 new Sephoras, we also are in the process of expanding to 32 new flagships. And where we've done that, we've seen the dollars per square foot actually increase. So we see the expansion of Sephora continuing into the future.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then would you mind just helping us calibrate a little bit your thinking on the second quarter? I think the gross margin comment, we have one piece of it being 80 basis points of pressure. I think you start – that's from the liquidations. You start to anniversary some of the appliances, which have a structurally different gross margin. And then maybe some of the other puts and takes there on both the comps and the gross margins, that's quite a noisy quarter for you in the second quarter. I'm not quite sure where you're pointing us in the model.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Mike, this is Ed. I'll take that. So without the closing stores, we would expect margin expansion in the quarter within our guidance range of 20 to 40 basis points. And then you layer the 80 basis points of pressure on top of that. I wouldn't make it any more complex than that. There are obviously incremental pressures with dot-com and the appliance ramp up, but that was incorporated in our plan.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it, guys.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.
Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Thanks, good morning and thanks for all the color here on the quarter. Just to follow up on Lorraine's question earlier that you guys expect comps in the second quarter to be within the range of your full-year guide, did I hear that correctly earlier?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Yes.
Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Okay, great. And then just on the other components of your full-year guide, Ed, just asset sales you expect to still be a little over $100 million. Any color on depreciation and/or the tax rate for the full year?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
On depreciation, we expect it to be down in the $35 million range give or take. We also expect interest expense in the $30 million to $35 million range before any cost to extinguish debt coming out of the tender. And then on tax rate, we really don't have a tax rate. We're expecting dollars to be give or take flat plus or minus a couple million.
Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay, great. And then just on the omni, just if we could just take a step back, are your inventory systems between the brick-and-mortar stores and online speaking to one another yet? Because obviously once you get that congruent, the margin opportunities, to your point Marvin, are significant. And then in addition, can you just give us a little perspective on where your online SKUs are today relative to in-store SKU count and where you think that can grow to over time, and if you have it, the percentage of overlap of SKUs online versus in-store?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So, Charles, I'll let Mike Amend take that. He can give you some specific color to your questions.
Michael Amend - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
So yes, our inventory systems are connected. Actually, the intelligent sourcing system that I spoke to earlier that we're rolling out right now has a single view, actually near real-time view of inventory both of our stores as well as dot-com that gets updated. So with that system, as you mentioned, one of the great capabilities that we're going to continue to leverage there is the most intelligent sourcing of order fulfillment to leverage the store inventory and the store base as well as our dot-com DCs. And so over time, we will continue to balance that inventory in an appropriate way to optimize for cost.
One of the great capabilities that this really adds and allows us to do is be able to leverage fashion and some of the other areas that it's harder to understand what the appropriate sales rate of that's going to be from an online perspective. So we can also spread that across the stores and leverage that. So that was one question.
And then speaking to your question in terms of our SKU growth, so our online right now, our SKU capacity or online number of SKUs is about twice what our largest store is. In the first quarter, our SKU count was up about 40%. We believe there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to expand in this space. If you look at what customer feedback is as well as if you look at what customers are searching for on our site, there's a clear opportunity for us to both expand in the categories that we're already in as well as new categories and with new brands.
And so we're in the pilot phase right now actually of rolling out a new product information management system, which will allow us to expose a portal directly to our vendors. And with that portal, what our suppliers will now be able to do, our drop-ship suppliers that we're currently working on many, many different partnerships with, will be able to then upload their catalogs directly into our system. And we will start to dramatically increase the assortment that we have available online, responding to customer needs in areas. And so we're doing this obviously with our drop-ship partners, so they'll own that inventory and they'll ship and fulfill those goods. But we're very excited about that and believe that that represents a very, very material growth opportunity for us going forward.
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
And, Charles, it goes without saying that this is truly not only the future of retail, this is modern day retailing. And for us, having been very slow and very traditional and candidly very old-fashioned about omnichannel, we've made a significant transformation within the last 16 months to a modernized omnichannel retailer that's going to have the ability to leverage every physical store location for fulfillment. That is significant for retail in general and very significant for JCPenney, and that's just a start. So we truly see this as a game-changer for us to continue to drive down those fulfillment costs.
That last-mile fulfillment cost is going to continue to put pressure on retail, either pure play or brick-and-mortar. And as Ed mentioned, I mean we're managing the cost well even without these new systems. And as Mike is able to on board these new processing systems, we see that only becoming more efficient

Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
That's great color. And just one last question for you, Marvin. Obviously, you've been really forward thinking here with the appliances and continuing to roll out Sephora and some of the home installment tests that you're doing. Just, can you show us a little bit of the playbook into 2018 other parts of the store, where you think you guys can get really creative and just more company-specific drivers for JCPenney?
Marvin R. Ellison - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
We have a couple of things that we're looking at. But the foundational focus we have is going to center around two things. Number one, it's going to have to be value oriented. We know we serve a value-based customer. For many years, we lost sight of that, and we try to serve customers that were not putting JCPenney in their consideration set. So we know that sweet spot for us is that customer with that household income of $90,000 a year and less. And we also understand within that, we want to have a very balanced view of selling the whole store.
I mean, we've been too focused category by category. And that's why we've gotten ourselves in trouble being so dependent on apparel that when apparel dramatically downturned, we had no other categories we could lean on. So you're going to see us be much more balanced. We need apparel, and apparel will always be important, but we also have to ramp up these other businesses, so that we can have more balance across the entire chain.
Having said that, we want to become a dominant home retailer. All the data tells us is that our customers want us to be in these spaces. They want us to sell appliances. Didn't appear counterintuitive initially, but it's one of our best businesses, and its continuing to grow. They want us to be in the beauty business, but also, we want to just serve the customers well. So we'll update the external world on some of these initiatives.
But for now, we're very excited about the home strategy regarding appliances and furniture and mattresses and some of these home install initiatives that we are very excited about. And we're very excited about beauty. We're excited about what that does from a differentiation standpoint, and we're excited about serving the underserved needs of our plus-sized and big-and-tall customer, which we didn't talk a lot about on this call, but we're still working on it. So more to come and we're excited about communicating these initiatives here in the future
Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Great, best of luck.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Kristen McDuffy with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Kristen McDuffy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thanks for the question. Can you talk a little bit about your plans with respect to future debt reduction? I know you've made a good effort with this $300 million tender. Would you consider a broader tender as market conditions improve? And also, how do you think about using your $500 million of secured capacity? Thanks.
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
Sure. I'll take that, obviously. So obviously, we announced a tender earlier this week to take that $300 million. We have $1.1 billion of near-term maturities as we sit today, a little under $1.1 billion. This will take us down to $800 million. We continue to assess the market, and see if it makes sense to upsize that tender or to initiate an additional tender to reduce those near-term maturities even more than that. We feel really good about the capital structure.
I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, but we've taken $1.4 billion of debt out at the completion of this tender over the last 3.5 years. And as I did say, we're going to, at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we'll end this year approximately 3 times. So, we think we've made substantial improvement to our capital structure. And we're going to continue to look for ways to improve it as we move forward.

Kristen McDuffy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
And just as a follow-up, do you think of that $500 million of secured capacity as a rainy day kind of fund? Or is it something you would be willing to tap to take out some of your unsecured maturities at some point?
Edward J. Record - J. C. Penney Co., Inc.
As we sit today, it's out there, if we need it. And if I go and tap it, then I lose that liquidity basically, especially if I use it to pay down near-term maturities. Right now, we're looking at the unsecured market and seeing if there's anything out there, but it's always there, if we need it.
Kristen McDuffy - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thanks so much.

The CEO Who’s Reinventing J.C. Penney

Marvin Ellison has scored some early successes at the troubled department store, but there’s a lot left to fix.
Question: If you wanted to buy a pair of men’s shoes at a department store, would you look for them next to (a) Men’s Clothing, or (b) Women’s Footwear?
Most shoppers would probably answer “a.” But at J.C. Penney 


jcp



, the 114-year-old retailing mainstay, the answer until very recently was “b.” Women make up about 80% of Penney’s clientele, and Penney managers believed that, generally speaking, those women were likely to buy shoes for their spouses and beaus, just as they did during the Kennedy administration.
“It was a terrible idea,” says Marvin Ellison, shaking his head as he walks a reporter through a Penney store in Frisco, Texas. “It took space away from women’s shoes, and it made it very difficult for men to want to buy shoes.”

Ellison, Penney’s newly minted 51-year-old CEO, had a better idea. He ran a test to see whether men’s shoes would sell faster when showcased next to, say, men’s suits; once the data showed that they did, he instituted that change last summer across the company’s 1,000-plus stores. Since entrusting guys to buy their own brogues and boots, Penney has seen double-digit sales gains in footwear. “That reset has been one of the smartest things we’ve done,” says Ellison.
This Frisco store, not far from company headquarters in Plano, north of Dallas, serves as Penney’s retail living lab, and as he continues the tour, Ellison proudly points out similar changes. Fashion jewelry now sits closer to its Liz Claiborne apparel brand, so women can try on accessories to go with a dress they might buy. The decor has been gussied up at the store’s traffic-driving in-house salons. Handbags got a face-lift too. After Penney failed to cash in on the recent handbag boom, managers did a deep-dive market analysis. Ellison’s conclusion: “Our handbags were ugly. We had to change them.” (It sounds less harsh in Ellison’s gentle Tennessee baritone.)

As the adage goes, “Retail is detail.” And if the details Ellison is addressing seem forehead-slap obvious, signs of how far J.C. Penney had fallen behind its rivals—well, welcome to his world. Ellison became CEO last August with a mandate to plug the store’s countless leaks in operations, strategy, and technology, problems left over from the chain’s nearly fatal attempt to reinvent itself four years ago. He and Penney’s board are betting that such small but meaningful improvements will add up to a full recovery.
That now-infamous overhaul, under then-CEO and former Apple 


aapl



 retail guru Ron Johnson, sought to reposition Penney as a flashier retailer with fancier merchandise. But it backfired: Customers fled, sales tumbled by almost a third, and Penney was crippled financially. Three years ago the board brought back Mike Ullman, the CEO it had unceremoniously chased out in favor of Johnson, to stop the U.S.S. Penney from sinking. And last summer he handed the reins to Ellison—an executive the opposite of flashy.
It’s fitting that Ellison, a lifelong musician, plays electric bass, an instrument that rarely gets a flashy solo but without which no band can click. He made his reputation in retail at Home Depot

, helping engineer that chain’s turnaround by focusing on unsexy but primordial things like the supply chain and the integration of stores and e-commerce. He’s a data devotee who grounds every decision in information—including that seemingly intuitive shoe move. “Pure intuition without any data gets you in trouble,” Ellison says. Referring to the Johnson era, he adds, “We went through 18 months of that, and we’re not going to do it again.”

Ellison’s early results are encouraging. Penney reported a 3.9% increase in comparable sales during the 2015 holidays, one of the best performances in retail that season. (Rival Macy’s saw “comps” shrink by 5.2%.) That followed seven quarters of sales growth in the previous eight. And although Penney hasn’t reported a profit since 2010—and hasn’t predicted when it will again—it’s aiming for $1.2 billion in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for fiscal 2017, nearly double the level of fiscal 2015.
The trees look nice, but the forest is daunting. Penney’s sales, an estimated $12.6 billion for the just-completed year, are still down 37% from their 2006 peak. Its nascent recovery, part of its fourth turnaround effort since 2000, hasn’t swayed Wall Street—its stock trades close to a 35-year low. In the long term, the problem isn’t just that Penney has been dysfunctional; it’s also that Penney is a department store, a practitioner of a business model under siege. It faces hordes of competitors in its core apparel and home-goods businesses: department-store rivals Kohl’s 


kss



 and Macy’s 


m



; Target 


tgt



 and Walmart 


wmt



; discounters like T.J. Maxx 


tjx



; and, of course, Amazon 


amzn



. And consumers, especially younger ones, have lost interest in browsing at the mall. “The struggle is not going to end,” says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “The traffic that is off isn’t coming back.”
Ellison’s response has been to make Penney smarter and more efficient at keeping customers loyal and selling more to each one. That means embracing Penney’s mall-ness—and trusting that there’s still a place in the retail landscape for a mid-market department store. And if that means playing catch-up for a few years before making bigger, bolder moves, so be it. “We’re going to start with the foundation: No one can beat us being us,” Ellison says.


Turnarounds are nothing new at J.C. Penney. Founded in 1902 as a Wyoming dry goods store, Penney became one of the 20th century’s biggest department stores and catalogue retailers, dominating middle-American towns and suburban malls. But sales began to erode in the late 2000s. Penney was slower than rivals to emerge from the Great Recession and struggled with shrinking profit margins in its apparel business.
This was the situation Ron Johnson was hired to turn around. In 2012 he began a sweeping transformation aimed at shedding Penney’s stodgy image. He dumped its coupon program and changed everything from the logo to the checkout process. Most notably, he tried to make Penney hipper. Johnson dropped or de-emphasized several profitable in-house clothing and home-goods product lines, while trotting out cheaper versions of upscale brands like Michael Graves and Bodum.

The results have been widely chronicled (including in Fortune): The makeover bombed, sales plummeted, and some 40,000 jobs were eliminated. (Johnson declined to comment for this article.) In the spring of 2013 the board ousted Johnson and rehired Ullman, but the worst damage was done. The chain’s inventory management and e-commerce operations were in chaos, and Penney ended up with some $5 billion in long-term debt. The hindsight consensus was that Johnson had dismissed Penney’s core shoppers: middle-income suburban moms with neither the inclination nor the budget to worry about being cutting-edge.
If anybody can relate to those customers, it’s Marvin Ellison. Ellison, one of only five African-American CEOs in the Fortune 500, grew up in Brownsville, Tenn., a two-stoplight town between Memphis and Nashville that was segregated well into the 1980s. He’s one of seven children, and his family was poor. His father at one point worked three jobs at once, too proud to take government assistance. Still, the Ellison family would shop twice a year at J.C. Penney, first for back-to-school clothes and then at Christmas. The family also performed as a gospel act—and got its stage outfits there too. “Going to J.C. Penney was a big deal. It was something we looked forward to,” his older sister Virginia recalls.

Marvin’s father, an honors student, had to drop out of high school to support his family after Marvin’s grandfather suffered a heart attack at harvest time. The senior Ellison saw education as a way out of poverty and imparted a deep love of reading to his kids. Marvin developed big ambitions at an early age: The books he likes best are biographies of Presidents; Harry Truman is his favorite. He met his wife, Sharyn, when both were students in the 1980s at what’s now the University of Memphis. (He later earned an MBA from Emory, in 2005.) Sharyn, 47, says Marvin caught her eye as the only young man on campus toting a briefcase rather than a backpack. Date nights early on revolved around episodes of Dallas, the ultimate business soap opera.
Ellison’s retail career started during college, almost by accident. To help pay for books and rent, he took a part-time job as a security officer at Target at $4.35 an hour. That gig turned into 15 years at the retailer, as he climbed the ranks in theft prevention. Those early jobs gave Ellison a close-up view of how retail works at the store level, everything from the cadence of markdowns to the science behind keeping shelves stocked. But the jobs also taught him something that would shape his management style: Too many managers don’t listen to the troops on the frontlines, the workers in stores. Ellison had tons of ideas but didn’t share them with managers, he says, because they wouldn’t ask.
“Too many CEOs in retail like to be the smartest person in the room,” says Home Depot co-founder and former CEO and chairman Bernie Marcus. “Marvin’s not like that.” After Ellison joined Home Depot in 2002, he promptly sought advice from Marcus, who had recently retired. The two went on store visits three or four times a year to talk strategy and culture. Home Depot soon went through its own crisis, enduring lagging sales and plummeting morale under CEO Bob Nardelli. After Frank Blake replaced Nardelli in 2007, Blake became another advocate for Ellison, eventually naming him head of U.S. stores.

Blake credits his former protégé with helping fix Home Depot’s dismal customer-satisfaction ratings and turning the company from an e-commerce laggard into a leader. He also praises Ellison’s knack for galvanizing workers. In one memorable innovation, Ellison launched a weekly video feature on Home Depot’s internal TV station that showcased customer-service success stories. Blake compares them to ESPN’s SportsCenter highlights: “They provided a ‘Wow, that’s amazing’ element to work so that people could see how impactful their work could be … It makes the associates stars.”
“Everyone on the board knew Marvin would end up running a major retailer,” adds Blake. But it wasn’t to be at Home Depot. In 2014 the company chose Craig Menear to succeed Blake. Menear had been the chain’s chief merchant, which meant he had an edge Ellison lacked: extensive experience deciding which merchandise to sell and working with buyers to spot promising products. Such “merchant princes” tend to dominate the corner office in retail: Former top merchants currently run Kohl’s and Macy’s.
But that résumé gap didn’t stop Penney’s board from approaching Ellison that summer to be its future CEO. Mike Ullman, who was instrumental in the search, says that while Ellison may not know merchandising inside and out, he is self-aware enough to surround himself with people who do. “He knows who he is and exactly what he wants to accomplish,” Ullman says.


Penney announced Ellison’s hiring in October 2014, and since then Ellison has conducted more than 60 employee town halls and visited 100 stores. In a relatively uncommon hiring agreement, Ellison was designated to become CEO, but first would spend nine months as president under Ullman. The two men traveled the world, visiting vendors and partners so that Ullman could give Ellison a crash course in areas he was less familiar with, like apparel factories, sourcing, and merchandising. The Ullman-to-Ellison CEO handoff took place last August, but even today Ellison is constantly listening and watching, taking the measure of his colleagues.
Face-to-face interaction helped Ellison quickly spot disconnects between Penney’s executives and its store employees. Early on, he was irked to see senior management in stores wearing designer clothing far beyond the budget of a typical staffer or customer. A snappy dresser himself, Ellison implemented a rule requiring executives to wear J.C. Penney–made clothes when they visit stores and to wear the same name tags store workers do. (During the Frisco store tour, Ellison and the executives all wore Penney brands—Ellison and the other men in Michael Strahan and Stafford suits, a woman colleague in Worthington.)
Fashion choices weren’t the only issue on which management and staff weren’t connecting. One legacy of the reinvention fiasco was that inventory management was a mess. Senior management frequently felt that stores were sufficiently stocked, but in-store employees were constantly alerting Ellison to shortages. Management’s misreading was exposed on Black Friday weekend in 2014. Penney rang up decent sales but left money on the table, as stores were out of stock of hot items because they had ordered too few. (One hint of the magnitude of lost sales: Penney ordered 330,000 pairs of women’s boots for Thanksgiving weekend in 2014 and ran out; in 2015 it ordered 1 million pairs.)

Inventory management is a challenge tailor-made for Ellison—part organizational, part technological. His new tech team, which includes several of his former Home Depot lieutenants, has instituted “demand-based logic”: Rather than, say, automatically shipping 1,000 handbags of a given make to every store every month, Penney now replenishes inventory based on real-time sales data. (That may sound like an obvious fix, but, hey, remember the men’s shoes?) Ellison is also refining Penney’s pricing decisions by building databases to better synchronize markdowns and promotions with changes in demand.
Penney’s tech to-do list is lengthy, particularly in e-commerce. All Kohl’s and Macy’s stores offer same-day pickup for online orders, something that Penney is only getting around to this year. And with smartphones fueling 50% of digital traffic, Penney cannot afford to have what Ellison concedes is currently a subpar shopping app. Mike Amend, one of the Home Depot transplants, is hustling to overhaul it. His priorities: integrating coupons and other incentives so that the app can tell shoppers an item’s bottom-line cost. (Amend needs to hurry up—Kohl’s app already does that.) Coming later this year: handheld devices that will let store workers check customers out from anywhere in the store, not just the registers. These devices may look familiar to some shoppers: They’re identical to the ones used at Home Depot.
As Ellison sees it, Penney’s growth will come from getting a lot more sales from its existing customers. Penney says it now has 87 million active shoppers, the same as in 2011. (At its nadir in 2013, Penney had lost 20 million customers.) It posted average annual sales of about $155 a square foot in 2014—33% below their 2006 peak and well behind those of its competitors (see charts below).

To make its stores more productive, Penney can tap a host of enviable retail franchises. Take its 850 hair salons. Few people know it, but the J.C. Penney salon business is the largest such chain in the country; in some markets they’re the dominant salons in town, destinations for prom days and wedding weekends. The salons themselves generate almost 5% of sales. Even more important: Penney says salon customers are among its most reliable shoppers. As Ullman says, “You can’t get a haircut online.” The salonistas come in eight times a year—twice as often as the average department-store customer—and spend twice as much.
Many of the salons, frankly, look tired. But Penney signed a deal last year with InStyle magazine to rebrand and upgrade them, with a full rollout due to be completed this year. (InStyle, like Fortune, is owned by Time Inc.)

 At the Frisco store the salon has been overhauled already, with slick signage, exposed-brick walls, and a bigger entryway designed to make it more visible and inviting. Penney hopes the rebranded salons will attract top-notch stylists who will, in turn, bring their clients—a new set of customers to woo.

Ellison also plans to better coordinate the salons with Penney’s in-store Sephora cosmetics boutiques—veritable cash machines where annual sales per square foot are almost $600. Of course, many Sephora shoppers come in, buy lipstick and mascara, and walk right out. Ellison is betting that souped-up salons in proximity to Sephora will offer customers a reason to spend more time at the store and keep them off Amazon.com.
Another prong of Ellison’s strategy: expanding a strong suite of private-label clothing brands. Penney-only brands in home goods and clothing together generate 51% of company sales; its top-selling attire brands include Arizona, St. John’s Bay, and Liz Claiborne. Penney is already a player in clothes for “big and tall” men, and it now wants a similar position in plus-size women’s clothing. But it also believes its brands could lure younger shoppers. That’s an existential priority: According to consultant Kantar Retail, the average Penney shopper is nearly 49 years old—up from 46.6 in 2011, and slightly older than the average at Target and Macy’s.
Ken Mangone, who oversees private brands, says Penney recently noticed that its a.n.a clothing brand was unexpectedly popular with younger women. Penney quickly developed Belle + Sky, a similar line intentionally focused on young shoppers, which it just rolled out to 500 stores. Ellison also used Belle + Sky to accomplish another goal: faster turnaround times to compete with “fast fashion” leaders like H&M and Forever 21. Penney squeezed the concept-to-production cycle time to 25 weeks for Belle + Sky, compared with about 35 weeks on average for its apparel lines.

Penney’s in-house brands have one thing in common: They’re affordable. According to Kantar, the average household income of a Penney shopper is $63,412, vs. $69,000 or so at Target and Kohl’s and $75,274 at Macy’s. Memories of watching his parents stretch their budget help Ellison relate to a lower-income customer, he says. He recalls that at one point, to make ends meet, his studious and ambitious father took an extra job as a busboy at a Ramada Inn: “If you saw the guy with a bow tie on, serving drinks, you had no idea who he was if you didn’t ask.” The blue-collar crowd isn’t the market that looks sexiest to investors, but he’s adamant that Penney’s future hinges on it. “We can convince ourselves that our core customers are a more affluent demographic, but really, they’re not,” he says.


As we tour the handbags section in the Frisco store, an annoyed customer approaches Ellison and his name-tag-wearing co-execs. There’s nobody around to ring her up, she complains, and she had the same problem at the holidays. “Why don’t the four of y’all get some cashiers,” she says. A store manager quickly steps forward to help. But when one underling tells the woman that the store has been busy, Ellison snaps, “ ‘Busy’ and ‘bad’ are the same thing to the customer.”
In a sense, being “busy” is a sign of a broader contraction. As sales have declined, department stores have closed locations and reduced headcount, compromising service and fueling more customer defections. Industry trends like those fuel skepticism about Penney’s future. Retail experts speak of Ellison with admiration, but many see built-in limits to what he can do. “Macy’s and J.C. Penney are fighting it out amongst themselves for a dwindling share of the market,” says consultant Robin Lewis, CEO of the Robin Report and a former head of Goldman Sachs’s 


GS



 retail practice. Kathy Gersch, founder of consultant Kotter International, notes that J.C. Penney is “fixing the major problems,” but if it can’t become relevant to younger customers, “ultimately there is a ceiling.”

The decline of the American mall makes Ellison’s job harder. According to Green Street Advisors, 635 of Penney’s 1,020 stores are in malls, and about a third of those are in so-called C- and D-malls—locations with a lot of vacancies, which in turn hurt traffic for the remaining tenants. (Penney has reduced store count by about 80 since 2012, but Ellison has resisted closing more.) Ellison’s biggest initiative so far is actually a play on the weakening mall climate. This year, for the first time since 1983, Penney is selling appliances, beginning with a 22-store pilot project. The decision is data driven: The stores realized that a lot of customers were searching for appliances on jcp.com. But it’s also a response to the fact that Sears 


SHLD



, another mall anchor, is shrinking fast—giving Penney a chance to grab shoppers looking for a fridge.
Observers waiting for a big, splashy move from Penney will have to keep waiting. Penney’s debt, which generates about $400 million a year in interest costs, is a handcuff that impedes any major makeovers. Its capital-spending budget is about $300 million a year, a fraction of what Target, Macy’s, and Kohl’s each spend. While Macy’s has been plotting an international expansion, and Kohl’s plays around with incorporating virtual reality and robots on the sales floor, Ellison is stuck with prosaic tasks. In February he announced that Penney was looking into selling and leasing back its Plano headquarters to whittle down some of that debt.
Pressed on whether Penney can return to its 2006 apex, when it had $20 billion in revenue, Ellison punts, saying he’s not so concerned with a top-line number as he is with creating a profitable, sustainable business. “We’re not going to sit on our hands and play the same cards we played in the past,” he says. “We’re going to be a modern retailer.” But there will be no retail-rock-star pyrotechnics. For now Ellison is playing bass, providing a steady foundation that may, someday, get Penney back in the groove.

 Corporate Executive of the Year: Marvin Ellison Is Penney Wise
Forget fancy. What JCPenney has now in Chairman and CEO Marvin R. Ellison is just what it needs—a humble, relatable leader who is quietly, steadily, brilliantly turning the company around

      by Alisa Gumbs   
      Posted: December 9, 2016

If you’ve walked into one of the more than 1,000 JCPenney stores across the U.S. and Puerto Rico lately, you may have been surprised to find what looks like—pardon the pun—
a shiny, new Penney.
Many of the stores have been refreshed with updated areas showcasing handbags and jewelry, called center core. This year, an additional 60 stores have seen the introduction of a Sephora inside JCPenney makeup boutique. Also, 120 of the chain’s hair salons have been rebranded in a partnership with InStyle magazine and now have attractive features, such as modern signage and exposed brick.
The numbers behind the retailer are looking just as bright. It has 87 million active shoppers, having recouped the 20 million shoppers it lost between 2011 and 2013. Sales per square foot were $165 in fiscal 2015, up 12% from two years prior—the best they’ve been since fiscal 2011.
With the first half of the year demonstrating growth—comparable store sales rose 2.2% in the second quarter—JCPenney is sticking to its earnings estimates. It’s projecting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $1 billion for 2016 and $1.2 billion for 2017, up from an adjusted $715 million in 2015 and a restated $377 million in 2014. All of this good news has boosted analyst and investor confidence in the stock; JCPenney shares have rallied more than 47% this year.
The man behind the turnaround, Chairman and CEO Marvin R. Ellison, is—not surprisingly—also making headlines. But the 51-year-old, who became president in 2014 and took over as chief executive last year, is more often lauded for his steadiness than his shine. Last year, The Dallas Morning News proclaimed that Ellison’s story is “classic JCPenney” with his hardworking, middle-income upbringing, and his willingness to grind every day. A Fortune cover story in March dubbed him “the opposite of flashy,” with astute attention to details, especially those often overlooked as obvious, and a relatability to the Penney customer.
While Ellison may lack flash, he’s got no shortage of brilliance. JCPenney executives describe him as an intelligent, inspiring, driven leader, who has coalesced the company’s 100,000 employees around a singular mission: to help their customer find what she loves with less time, money, and effort. His leadership in restoring the value of JCPenney for its customers, associates, and shareholders is precisely why Ellison has been named the 2016 Black Enterprise Corporate Executive of the Year.

Teaching an Old Retailer New Tricks
 
It’s no small task to bring a legacy retailer like the 114-year-old JCPenney—founded as “The Golden Rule” by James Cash Penney, in Kemmerer, Wyoming—into the age of Amazon. However, that challenge becomes gargantuan when the company is reeling from a failed reinvention, which saw sales plummet by 35% and resulted in the layoff of 40,000 employees.
“I don’t think anyone in the external environment can really understand how difficult the situation was that Mike Ullman walked into in 2013,” Ellison said of his predecessor at this year’s analyst meeting, adding that when he took over, he’d counted more than 150 projects the company was trying to tackle simultaneously to turn itself around.
“When I started, one of the first things I would ask the team was, ‘Describe our customer. Outline who our three chief competitors are. What are some of the key financial milestones we need to try to hit? Really, what’s our mission, as a company?’ Those sound like very basic and fundamental questions,” Ellison says, “but if you’re in the midst of a turnaround, everything’s important. You want to serve every customer. You want to chase every financial measure. But, when you’re chasing so many different things, you’re diluting your focus and you’re diluting your ability to solve the biggest, most importunate issues.”
In addition to streamlining and clarifying the company’s objectives, Ellison had to build a team that could take them through the next phase of the turnaround. Of the original 13 people that reported to the CEO when he first arrived, only two remain today. All are focused on the framework of three areas that are key to the company’s resurgence. Ellison calls them the “strategic pillars”: revenue per customer, omnichannel, and private brands.
One of the ways the company plans to increase revenue per customer is with its center core concept, which it tested in 12 of its stores for almost a year before rolling it out to a third of all stores; those stores are now outperforming the chain. Such data-driven decisions and similar testing are hallmarks of new initiatives, such as a return to selling appliances after a 30-year hiatus.
The omnichannel strategy is all about balancing traditional sales and e-commerce. “We’re all facing the same challenges, and that is how you create a seamless connection between brick-and-mortar and your digital customer. It is critically important in any traditional retailer. There is no perfect science, but we were way behind,” Ellison says.
JCPenney’s been working hard to catch up, with this year’s chainwide rollout of its “buy online, pick up in store” service and a redesigned mobile app. “Streamlining the experience, so customers can find what they want, when they want, and how they want, is something that we’re keenly focused on. We’re continuing to make shopping simpler than it ever has been before,” says Michael Amend, executive vice president of omnichannel.
Private labels currently account for just over half of the retailer’s sales, or $6 billion in 2015, but the company plans to grow that to as much as 70% within the next three years. Just this quarter, it has announced a new signature line of high-end cookware from Cooks and a plus-size line from Project Runway winner Ashley Nell Tipton.
One of the private label success stories is Collection by Michael Strahan, a menswear line from the NFL player turned television host that launched last year online and in 200 stores with suits, sports coats, dress shirts, and accessories such as ties, belts, cufflinks, and suspenders. This year saw the addition of shoes to the collection as well as a new line of activewear under the label MSX by Michael Strahan. Both lines are available in extended sizes and are now in 500 stores.
“I remember the JCPenney catalog as a kid. That was always a big thing when that came in the mail,” Strahan told USA Today when the first collection launched. “They have always made fashionable, stylish clothing, but most important, affordable clothing. I thought that was very important to make things people can actually afford and that are fashion-forward. I’m glad that we’re partners.”
Gross profit margins are higher on private brands, at a reported 40% for JCPenney compared to 30% for the national brands it carries. “How we build our private brands and build value into them is going to be the key,” says Chief Merchant John Tighe. “Marvin has helped us find ways to expand our brands, expand our offering, and get better every day in what we do.”
“As long as we can give the customers a reason to shop [with] us in store and online, and we can offer products that create a level of differentiation between us and everyone else, this company will continue to be successful,” Ellison says. “If we can hit our financial plan for the second half of the year, we will bring this company back from the brink of extinction to profitability.”


The Right Man for the Job
 
At the time of Ellison’s hiring in 2014, Thomas J. Engibous, then chairman of JCPenney’s board of directors, said in a press release, “The Board has completed its search for the right CEO to lead the next stage of JCPenney’s growth. We are delighted to have found that person in Marvin Ellison, a highly accomplished retail executive with a history of delivering top and bottom line results at major American retailers. … We believe he is well equipped to return the company to profitable growth.”
Ellison’s predecessor, former CEO Ullman, agreed: “Over the course of his career, he has proven his ability to produce results by improving operations, building customer loyalty, and motivating his teams. His experience and leadership are exactly what we need to accelerate the progress we have made over the last 18 months.”
A lot of what Ellison has been able to accomplish since then has been data-driven, which is part of the science of retail. However, there’s also an art to what he does, and his retail instincts have served him well, especially in this position.
“Because I grew up most of my life with value and saving money as the primary expectation around how to live life, as we think about the ways we can serve customers, operating in the same demographic and the same household income, I connect really well with that,” he says. Simply put, Ellison knows the JCPenney customer so intimately, because he’s been the JCPenney customer.
The fourth of seven children, Ellison grew up in the small town of Brownsville, Tennessee, roughly an hour and 20 minutes northeast of Memphis. “There was a JCPenney in Jackson, Tennessee, about 20 minutes from our home. We would oftentimes shop there for back-to-school and for Christmas,” Ellison says.
“My parents, for many years, struggled financially to maintain a good household; making sure that we had clothes to wear, we had food to eat, we had a place to stay, and that we could get up every day and feel good about ourselves. But, we also operated on a pretty tight budget. We had an understanding that it was important for us to be really, really smart about everything we did, and how we spent our money. Growing up that way, working my way through college, and in some cases, having to work two jobs while going to school full time, gives you a sense of appreciation for anyone operating on a budget and customers that are looking for value,” he says.
Ironically, it was his need to work during college that ignited Ellison’s career in retail. He went to his school’s employment office with one simple request: employment at the highest paying, part-time job that they had available. It happened to be at Target, and it paid four dollars and thirty-five cents an hour.
Ellison’s start at Target as an hourly store security officer marked the beginning of both his love of retail and his leadership philosophy of listening to the employees on the front lines. He went on to earn a business administration degree in marketing from the University of Memphis and an M.B.A. from Emory University. He also spent 15 years working his way up the ranks, before heading to The Home Depot for a 12-year stint that led to his rise to executive vice president of U.S. stores, with responsibility for more than 700 stores and 150,000 associates.
“I’ve always had big dreams and aspirations. I had no idea how I would get there, but my parents were so wise that they never snuffed out a dream. It didn’t matter if it didn’t make any sense at all, they would just say, ‘You can do it. Focus on your education, put God first, be a good person, work hard, and you can achieve all your dreams in life,’” he says.
Ellison was very serious about those big dreams, as his wife, Sharyn, can attest, “I used to tell him, when we were in college, ‘You’re going to be real good at being old, because you’re getting so much practice right now.’ Well, he’s actually a lot lighter now than he was when we were in college, because he was very serious. He was stricken with wisdom at an early age.”

The Secret to His Success
 
So how has Ellison been able to translate that wisdom into forward momentum, across an organization as weary and wary of change as JCPenney must have been after its failed makeover? According to the executive team Ellison’s built to help him effect that change, it involves getting a lot of feedback, setting a crystal-clear vision, and getting everyone on board.
“Marvin has the ability to put himself in other people’s shoes in a really profound way. I don’t think he’s ever forgotten where he’s come from. Even as he interacts with people on a day-to-day basis, he starts with positive intent and an ability to understand where that person is coming from. He’s an incredible listener and an incredible storyteller,” says Chief Customer and Marketing Officer Mary Beth West, one of Black Enterprise’s “75 Most Powerful Women in Business” and “Top Women in Advertising and Marketing.” West, who had served on JCPenney’s board since 2005 when she was tapped for the position last year, has brought 25 years of marketing leadership and brand management from Kraft and Mondelēz to the retailer.
Ellison’s listening skills are a strength mentioned again and again by his colleagues. “If you talk to those who have worked for and with Marvin, the feedback from them would be that he truly looks to engage each and every individual throughout the organization, hear what their input is, and see what they are seeing,” Amend says.
Joe McFarland, executive vice president of stores, who followed  Ellison from Home Depot, agrees, “He understands how to motivate people. He understands the buttons to push to get the best out of a person. Marvin has extremely high standards, as it relates to performance. There are no free rides. He sets a very aggressive timeline for us, but he’s also a great mentor to guide you on the how to get there. You’ll never have one of those moments where you sit back and ask yourself, ‘Am I on the right track?’ The way that he leads, he brings you along with him.”
That ride is a long way from over. There’s still a lot of work to be done at JCPenney. The share price, at just under $10, is still well below its $86 peak from 2007. Average annual sales per square foot are still significantly below competitors, such as Kohl’s, and total sales are nowhere near the $18 billion the retailer produced in 2009.
But analysts are seeing the bright side. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank reiterated its “Buy” rating on the stock. “JCP is taking market share from peers which likely include other department stores as well as specialty apparel players, many of whom are closing doors at an accelerated pace. This top-line resurgence is occurring while the company is right-sizing the entity,” analyst Paul Trussell reported. “CEO Marvin Ellison has his newly assembled team focused, and his recent open market purchase [Ellison bought 50,000 shares of JCP stock in March] highlights his personal conviction in the opportunity that lies ahead.”
And Ellison himself believes the company is in its final phase of the turnaround, which he’s calling the “growth and profitability” phase. “We’ve been working our way over the past twelve months, and we’ve made great progress,” he says. “We have a lot of work to do, but the journey has at least started.”

 Educational Background



Certificate Business Administration in Marketing 


University of Memphis

                  The University of Memphis, also called the U of M, is an American public research university located in the Normal Station neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee and is the flagship institution of the Tennessee Board of Regents system.

With an enrollment of more than 23,000 students, the University of Memphis has 25 Chairs of Excellence and five state-approved Centers of Excellence.

The University maintains the Journalism and Public Relations department, Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI), Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, the former Lambuth University campus, which is now a branch campus of the University, the Loewenberg School of Nursing, FedEx Institute of Technology, and the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology.                




Master of Business Administration 


Emory University - Goizueta Business School

                  On February 18, 1919, the dean of Emory College, Howard Odum, recommended the creation of a “school of economics and business administration” to the Board of Trustees. Thus, in the fall of 1919, the new school worked with Emory College to offer courses in economics, accounting, and business law. By 1925, there was one faculty member and full-time assistant, five staff members and 145 students. In 1926, eight students received the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Two decades after the school awarded degrees in business administration, the school accepted its first female student in 1954. In the same year, the MBA program commenced, with 19 registered students.
Goizueta Business School

In 1992, the evening MBA program was introduced. At the same time, the school was achieving greater validation for its programs. When the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business began accrediting master’s programs, Emory’s program was one of the first to be approved. Four years later, Emory appeared on the list of the top American colleges and universities producing U.S. executives. This newfound acclaim accompanied new programs, such as the concentration within the MBA program for professional accounting and, in 1979, the Executive MBA program. Also at this time, the school created a plan to allow students to complete both the MBA and Juris Doctor degree within four years. Rankings of the school’s programs highlight the results of thoughtful and steady expansion. In 1986, the Executive MBA program was ranked in the top 15 in a Business Week survey.

In 1994, the school was renamed for Roberto C. Goizueta, a much admired and successful business leader. More than providing a namesake for the school, Roberto C. Goizueta placed his philosophical stamp on the school’s academic and financial development. Goizueta proclaimed, “Business schools today cannot just reflect business the way it is. They must teach business the way it will be.” The millennium brought about a new PhD program in business administration and a new program in Real Estate. Goizueta Business School installed its current dean, Professor Larry Benveniste, in 2005
