Second Quarter 2017 Highlights


-  Organic sales increase 5.8%


-  Operating income margin of 14.0%, 14.7% on an adjusted basis


-  EPS of $0.92, Adjusted EPS of $0.97


 


CLEVELAND, July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") (Nasdaq:LECO) today reported second quarter 2017 net income of $61.4 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.92, which includes acquisition transaction and integration costs of $4.5 million, $3.5 million after-tax, or $0.05 EPS, related to the proposed acquisition of Air Liquide Welding.  The second quarter 2017 also includes a $2.9 million, or $0.04 EPS, tax benefit from stock option exercises that are now recognized through income tax expense following the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter 2017.  Second quarter 2016 net income was $31.3 million, or $0.45 EPS, and on an adjusted basis, $57.4 million, or $0.83 EPS.
Second quarter 2017 sales increased 5.8% to $626.9 million on 3.2% higher volumes and a 2.6% increase in price.  Excluding Venezuela from prior year results due to the deconsolidation of the operation, sales increased 6.9%, from 4.2% higher volumes and a 2.7% increase in price.
Operating income for second quarter 2017 was $87.6 million, or 14.0% of sales.  This compares with operating income of $48.1 million, or 8.1% of sales, in the comparable 2016 period.  On an adjusted basis, operating income was $92.1 million, or 14.7% of sales, as compared with $82.4 million, or 13.9% of sales, in the prior year.
On April 27, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Air Liquide to acquire its Air Liquide Welding subsidiary.  The definitive agreement reflects an approximate $131 million purchase price for the Air Liquide Welding business, including the assumption of net debt and working capital adjustments.  The proposed acquisition is expected to close on July 31, 2017.
"We achieved good momentum in the second quarter with sales growth across all three segments and among most end markets," stated Christopher L. Mapes, chairman, president and chief executive officer.  "Financial performance remained solid as operational initiatives and volume improvements helped mitigate rising raw material costs and operating expenses.  Given sustained improvement in year-over-year demand, we expect to continue to achieve modest sales and margin growth in 2017.  We are also looking forward to completing the Air Liquide Welding acquisition, which will further advance our '2020 Vision and Strategy'."
Six Months 2017 Summary
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $117.2 million, or EPS of $1.76, which includes acquisition transaction and integration costs of $8.1 million, $6.2 million after-tax, or $0.09 EPS, related to the proposed acquisition of Air Liquide Welding.  The six months ended June 30, 2017 also includes a $4.1 million, or $0.06 EPS, tax benefit from stock option exercises that are now recognized through income tax expense following the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter 2017.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net income was $85.0 million, or $1.22 EPS, and on an adjusted basis, $111.0 million, or $1.60 EPS.
Sales increased 5.7% to $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017 on 3.1% higher volumes and a 2.4% increase in price.  Excluding Venezuela from prior year results due to the deconsolidation of the operation, sales increased 6.7%, from 4.1% higher volumes and a 2.4% increase in price.

Non-GAAP Information
Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share and Return on invested capital are non-GAAP financial measures.  Management uses non-GAAP measures to assess the Company's operating performance by excluding certain disclosed special items that management believes are not representative of the Company's core business.  Management believes that excluding these special items enables them to make better period-over-period comparisons and benchmark the Company's operational performance against other companies in its industry more meaningfully.  Furthermore, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information that provides a more complete understanding of Company operating results and enables investors to analyze financial and business trends more thoroughly.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures and have limitations including, but not limited to, their usefulness as comparative measures as other companies may define their non-GAAP measures differently.
Forward-Looking Statements
The Company's expectations and beliefs concerning the future contained in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements reflect management's current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "guidance" or words of similar meaning.  Actual results may differ materially from such statements due to a variety of factors that could adversely affect the Company's operating results.  The factors include, but are not limited to: general economic and market conditions; the effectiveness of operating initiatives; completion of planned divestitures; interest rates; disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets that may limit our access to capital; currency exchange rates and devaluations; adverse outcome of pending or potential litigation; actual costs of the Company's rationalization plans; possible acquisitions, including the Company's ability to successfully complete the Air Liquide Welding business acquisition; market risks and price fluctuations related to the purchase of commodities and energy; global regulatory complexity; and the possible effects of events beyond our control, such as political unrest, acts of terror and natural disasters, on the Company or its customers, suppliers and the economy in general.  For additional discussion, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Lincoln Electric is an American multinational and a global manufacturer of welding products, arc welding equipment, welding consumables, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment and robotic welding systems.
The Fortune 1000 company is headquartered in Euclid, Ohio, United States and has a worldwide network of distributors and sales offices covering more than 160 countries. It has 42 manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Latin America. It also operates manufacturing alliances and joint ventures in 19 countries.[1]
Lincoln Electric's business model was listed as one of the most studied by the Harvard Business School and has been featured in many case studies by other business schools around the world. Since 1975, eight cases have been written about Lincoln Electric by the Harvard Business School alone.[2]
The company reported over $2.9 billion sales in 2013, with sales from North America accounting for 50% of it. Lincoln has over 8500+ employees globally and 3000 in the United States alone. Among Lincoln Electric's subsidiaries is The Harris Products Group, which is a manufacturer of Welding Consumables, Gas Apparatus, and other Specialty Products. The Harris Products Group has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Ohio, California, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Italy.
The company was founded in 1895 by John C. Lincoln with a capital investment of $200 to make electric motors he had designed.[3]
History[edit]
1895[edit]

John C. Lincoln founded The Lincoln Electric Company with a capital investment of $200.00. The product: electric motors of his own design.

1900 - 1919[edit]

John C.'s younger brother, James F. Lincoln, joined the Company as a salesman in 1907. Meanwhile, the product line had been expanded to include battery chargers for electric automobiles. A welding set was first made by the Lincoln brothers in 1909. In 1911, Lincoln Electric introduced the first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world.
In 1914, wishing to concentrate on scientific investigation, John C. turned the reins of the Company over to James F. Lincoln. James F. introduced piecework pay and established the Employee Advisory Board, which includes elected representatives from every department and has met every two weeks ever since. By 1915, in a progressive effort for its time, Lincoln Electric employees were covered by group life insurance.
In 1916, The Lincoln Electric Company of Canada was incorporated to distribute the U.S. made products. The next year, The Lincoln Electric Welding School was founded. The school has trained more than 100,000 people since its inception in 1917.

1920 - 1939[edit]

Lincoln Electric's production of welders surpassed that of motors for the first time in 1922, making welding the company's primary business. In 1927, Lincoln Electric introduced the Fleetweld® 5 coated electrode which produced welds with 20 - 50% higher tensile strength and 100% greater ductility than those made with bare electrodes.
Lincoln Electric employees earned paid vacations, among the first in the nation, in 1923. The first Lincoln Electric employee stock ownership plan, one of the first in the country, was initiated in 1925. An employee suggestion program was implemented in 1929. Lincoln Electric employees received their first annual Incentive Bonus in 1934. While the average Lincoln Electric worker's pay more than doubled during the decade of the Great Depression, electrodes which had sold for $0.16/lb in 1929 were selling for less than $0.06/lb by 1942.
After working 12 years to perfect a ductile weld, John Lincoln created a patented flux which, for the first time, made a weld as flexible as steel.
The Procedure Handbook of Arc Welding Design and Practice, first published in 1933, is today in its 14th edition.[4] More than 500,000 copies of this book have been sold.[5] In 1936, The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation was founded as a nonprofit educational organization to advance arc welding as a leading materials joining process. That same year, a young salesman named William I. Miskoe was sent halfway around the world to establish The Lincoln Electric Company Pty. Ltd. in Australia.

1940 - 1949[edit]

World War II brought a dramatic expansion of Lincoln Electric's business, with welded ship hulls creating an enormous new market for arc welding products. After many Lincoln Electric workers were drafted, the company hired large numbers of women and minority factory workers for the first time. Motor production was suspended to focus resources on supporting the wartime welding product demand.

1950 - 1969[edit]

In 1951, Lincoln Electric constructed a modern plant with unique material handling capabilities in Euclid, Ohio. Lincoln Electric France SA was established in 1953 with the construction of a plant in Rouen, a short trip from Paris. Major innovations of the 1950s included the Jetweld fast-fill low hydrogen stick electrodes and Innershield® self-shielded flux-cored wire electrodes.
James F. Lincoln continued to enhance Incentive Management, adding a cost of living multiplier, formal merit rating, and guaranteed continuous employment. In 1959, John C. Lincoln died.
In the 1960s, motors returned to the company's product line with a new model featuring an extruded aluminum frame and automatically wound stator coils. James F. Lincoln died in 1965.

1970 - 1989[edit]

Lincoln Electric entered a new era of professional management with the promotions of George E. Willis to president and William Irrgang to chairman in 1972. The Mentor, Ohio, electrode plant was started up in 1977 to produce the company's domestic wire consumables products.
The early 1980s were a time of hardship, with Lincoln Electric's sales dropping 40 percent in response to the combined effects of inflation, sharply higher energy costs, and a national recession. Although guaranteed continuous employment received a severe test, not one Lincoln Electric employee was laid off for lack of work.
In 1986, George E. Willis was named chairman and Donald F. Hastings became president. Mr. Willis pursued an energetic course of foreign expansion; eventually, Lincoln Electric obtained a controlling interest in manufacturing operations located in 16 countries.

1990 - 1995[edit]

In, 1992, Mr. Hastings became chairman and Frederick W. Mackenbach was promoted to president. In 1991, an expanded world headquarters facility opened with expanded and renovated Weld Technology and training center operations. Foreign operations were consolidated and reorganized.
In 1993, during the global reorganization, Don Hastings and Fred Mackenbach urged the Company's U.S. employees to pursue record levels of production and sales. In true Lincoln Electric spirit, they responded by voluntarily postponing 614 weeks of vacation in order to meet customer demand for product. Sales records were set every quarter since mid-1993.
Lincoln Electric added more than 600 new employees during 1994. On June 8, 1995, the Company's Centennial year, a new motor facility opened. The Lincoln Electric Company achieved its one billion dollar sales goal during its centennial year.

1996[edit]

The board of directors appointed Anthony A. Massaro as President, succeeding the retiring Frederick W. Mackenbach. On November 1, Mr. Massaro was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hastings remained as Chairman until May, 1997.
A multimillion-dollar expansion and update of domestic research and development facilities was approved by the board. Expansion activities included an acquisition of Electronic Welding Systems (EWS) in Italy, a planned joint venture in China and a manufacturing joint venture in Jakarta, Indonesia.

In addition, Lincoln Electric secured its own aluminum wire capability and brand through acquisition of Canadian company, Indalco, a manufacturer of aluminum wire and rod. In other global happenings, Lincoln Electric secured a 50% stake in AS Kaynak, a leading Turkish producer of welding consumables and opened a distribution center in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Products abounded with more than 23 new products and services introduced to the market in 1998, including ArcLink the arc welding industry’s first communications protocol, at the annual American Welding Society Exposition.
In 1998, Lincoln Electric also distributed its 65th consecutive bonus to employees and achieved the fifth consecutive year of record financial performance. In investor news, shareholders approved the formation of a holding company, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. With this transition came a conversion from dual class stock (voting and non-voting) to a single-class, all voting stock. This action doubled the number of outstanding shares.

1999[edit]

In January 1999, Lincoln Electric established a majority-held, joint venture electrode plant in the Philippines with distributor partners. During the American Welding Society's International Welding and Fabricating Exposition in St. Louis, Lincoln unveiled some never-before-seen products including the Multi-Weld system, designed for welding large structures, and the Power MIG: The Professional Choice, 255 combination wire feeder/welder. Lincoln Electric also debuted a host of new electrodes.

Lincoln Foundation, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and Lincoln Welding School[edit]
The J.F.Lincoln Foundation is a non-profit, welding education organization founded in 1936 to promote welding as a better method of joining metals and to promote welding as a career choice. It is the only organization in the United States solely dedicated to educating the public about the art and science of arc welding. Formed when the arc welding industry was in its infancy, the Foundation is now in its seventh decade of publishing educational texts and granting cash awards to recognize technical achievements.[10]
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established by Lincoln Electric's founder, John C. Lincoln, in 1946, based on his admiration for the work of Henry George. Today, the think tank still focuses on promoting "creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges." [11]
The Lincoln Electric Welding School was set up in 1917, and has since then instructed over 100,000 men and women in the various methods and techniques of safety and arc welding processes. The school is listed by the Ohio State Board of School and College Registration.[12]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Lincoln Electric is an American multinational and a global manufacturer of welding products, arc welding equipment, welding consumables, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment and robotic welding systems.
The Fortune 1000 company is headquartered in Euclid, Ohio, United States and has a worldwide network of distributors and sales offices covering more than 160 countries. It has 42 manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Latin America. It also operates manufacturing alliances and joint ventures in 19 countries.[1]
Lincoln Electric's business model was listed as one of the most studied by the Harvard Business School and has been featured in many case studies by other business schools around the world. Since 1975, eight cases have been written about Lincoln Electric by the Harvard Business School alone.[2]
The company reported over $2.9 billion sales in 2013, with sales from North America accounting for 50% of it. Lincoln has over 8500+ employees globally and 3000 in the United States alone. Among Lincoln Electric's subsidiaries is The Harris Products Group, which is a manufacturer of Welding Consumables, Gas Apparatus, and other Specialty Products. The Harris Products Group has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Ohio, California, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Italy.
The company was founded in 1895 by John C. Lincoln with a capital investment of $200 to make electric motors he had designed.[3]
History[edit]
1895[edit]

John C. Lincoln founded The Lincoln Electric Company with a capital investment of $200.00. The product: electric motors of his own design.

1900 - 1919[edit]

John C.'s younger brother, James F. Lincoln, joined the Company as a salesman in 1907. Meanwhile, the product line had been expanded to include battery chargers for electric automobiles. A welding set was first made by the Lincoln brothers in 1909. In 1911, Lincoln Electric introduced the first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world.
In 1914, wishing to concentrate on scientific investigation, John C. turned the reins of the Company over to James F. Lincoln. James F. introduced piecework pay and established the Employee Advisory Board, which includes elected representatives from every department and has met every two weeks ever since. By 1915, in a progressive effort for its time, Lincoln Electric employees were covered by group life insurance.
In 1916, The Lincoln Electric Company of Canada was incorporated to distribute the U.S. made products. The next year, The Lincoln Electric Welding School was founded. The school has trained more than 100,000 people since its inception in 1917.

1920 - 1939[edit]

Lincoln Electric's production of welders surpassed that of motors for the first time in 1922, making welding the company's primary business. In 1927, Lincoln Electric introduced the Fleetweld® 5 coated electrode which produced welds with 20 - 50% higher tensile strength and 100% greater ductility than those made with bare electrodes.
Lincoln Electric employees earned paid vacations, among the first in the nation, in 1923. The first Lincoln Electric employee stock ownership plan, one of the first in the country, was initiated in 1925. An employee suggestion program was implemented in 1929. Lincoln Electric employees received their first annual Incentive Bonus in 1934. While the average Lincoln Electric worker's pay more than doubled during the decade of the Great Depression, electrodes which had sold for $0.16/lb in 1929 were selling for less than $0.06/lb by 1942.
After working 12 years to perfect a ductile weld, John Lincoln created a patented flux which, for the first time, made a weld as flexible as steel.
The Procedure Handbook of Arc Welding Design and Practice, first published in 1933, is today in its 14th edition.[4] More than 500,000 copies of this book have been sold.[5] In 1936, The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation was founded as a nonprofit educational organization to advance arc welding as a leading materials joining process. That same year, a young salesman named William I. Miskoe was sent halfway around the world to establish The Lincoln Electric Company Pty. Ltd. in Australia.

1940 - 1949[edit]

World War II brought a dramatic expansion of Lincoln Electric's business, with welded ship hulls creating an enormous new market for arc welding products. After many Lincoln Electric workers were drafted, the company hired large numbers of women and minority factory workers for the first time. Motor production was suspended to focus resources on supporting the wartime welding product demand.

1950 - 1969[edit]

In 1951, Lincoln Electric constructed a modern plant with unique material handling capabilities in Euclid, Ohio. Lincoln Electric France SA was established in 1953 with the construction of a plant in Rouen, a short trip from Paris. Major innovations of the 1950s included the Jetweld fast-fill low hydrogen stick electrodes and Innershield® self-shielded flux-cored wire electrodes.
James F. Lincoln continued to enhance Incentive Management, adding a cost of living multiplier, formal merit rating, and guaranteed continuous employment. In 1959, John C. Lincoln died.
In the 1960s, motors returned to the company's product line with a new model featuring an extruded aluminum frame and automatically wound stator coils. James F. Lincoln died in 1965.

1970 - 1989[edit]

Lincoln Electric entered a new era of professional management with the promotions of George E. Willis to president and William Irrgang to chairman in 1972. The Mentor, Ohio, electrode plant was started up in 1977 to produce the company's domestic wire consumables products.
The early 1980s were a time of hardship, with Lincoln Electric's sales dropping 40 percent in response to the combined effects of inflation, sharply higher energy costs, and a national recession. Although guaranteed continuous employment received a severe test, not one Lincoln Electric employee was laid off for lack of work.
In 1986, George E. Willis was named chairman and Donald F. Hastings became president. Mr. Willis pursued an energetic course of foreign expansion; eventually, Lincoln Electric obtained a controlling interest in manufacturing operations located in 16 countries.

1990 - 1995[edit]

In, 1992, Mr. Hastings became chairman and Frederick W. Mackenbach was promoted to president. In 1991, an expanded world headquarters facility opened with expanded and renovated Weld Technology and training center operations. Foreign operations were consolidated and reorganized.
In 1993, during the global reorganization, Don Hastings and Fred Mackenbach urged the Company's U.S. employees to pursue record levels of production and sales. In true Lincoln Electric spirit, they responded by voluntarily postponing 614 weeks of vacation in order to meet customer demand for product. Sales records were set every quarter since mid-1993.
Lincoln Electric added more than 600 new employees during 1994. On June 8, 1995, the Company's Centennial year, a new motor facility opened. The Lincoln Electric Company achieved its one billion dollar sales goal during its centennial year.

1996[edit]

The board of directors appointed Anthony A. Massaro as President, succeeding the retiring Frederick W. Mackenbach. On November 1, Mr. Massaro was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hastings remained as Chairman until May, 1997.
A multimillion-dollar expansion and update of domestic research and development facilities was approved by the board. Expansion activities included an acquisition of Electronic Welding Systems (EWS) in Italy, a planned joint venture in China and a manufacturing joint venture in Jakarta, Indonesia.

1997[edit]

The Lincoln Electric Board of Directors announces the appointment of Anthony A. Massaro as chairman of the company, making him the sixth chairman. At the American Welding Society tradeshow in April, the company introduces many products resulting from a new product development process.

1998[edit]

1998 was a year of expansion, acquisition and product development for Lincoln Electric. In the global arena, Lincoln Electric opened an electrode plant in Shanghai, China and acquired Uhrhan & Schwill, of Essen, Germany, a designer and installer of pipe welding systems for pipe mills. In addition, Lincoln Electric secured its own aluminum wire capability and brand through acquisition of Canadian company, Indalco, a manufacturer of aluminum wire and rod. In other global happenings, Lincoln Electric secured a 50% stake in AS Kaynak, a leading Turkish producer of welding consumables and opened a distribution center in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Products abounded with more than 23 new products and services introduced to the market in 1998, including ArcLink the arc welding industry’s first communications protocol, at the annual American Welding Society Exposition.
In 1998, Lincoln Electric also distributed its 65th consecutive bonus to employees and achieved the fifth consecutive year of record financial performance. In investor news, shareholders approved the formation of a holding company, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. With this transition came a conversion from dual class stock (voting and non-voting) to a single-class, all voting stock. This action doubled the number of outstanding shares.

1999[edit]

In January 1999, Lincoln Electric established a majority-held, joint venture electrode plant in the Philippines with distributor partners. During the American Welding Society's International Welding and Fabricating Exposition in St. Louis, Lincoln unveiled some never-before-seen products including the Multi-Weld system, designed for welding large structures, and the Power MIG: The Professional Choice, 255 combination wire feeder/welder. Lincoln Electric also debuted a host of new electrodes.
Also in 1999, the company completed the sale of its motor business to the Marathon Division of Regal-Beloit, preserving Guaranteed Employment Policy through the process.

2000[edit]

Lincoln Electric acquires C.I.F.E. Spa, an Italian manufacturer of welding consumables and Europe’s premier producer of MIG wire. Production begins in Lincoln’s new manufacturing facility in Brazil.

2001[edit]

The Company expands its operations in South America with the acquisition of Messer Soldaduras de Venezuela, the country’s leading manufacturer of consumable welding products. The David C. Lincoln Technology Center is completed, ensuring Lincoln Electric’s leadership position in product development.

Lincoln Foundation, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and Lincoln Welding School[edit]
The J.F.Lincoln Foundation is a non-profit, welding education organization founded in 1936 to promote welding as a better method of joining metals and to promote welding as a career choice. It is the only organization in the United States solely dedicated to educating the public about the art and science of arc welding. Formed when the arc welding industry was in its infancy, the Foundation is now in its seventh decade of publishing educational texts and granting cash awards to recognize technical achievements.[10]
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established by Lincoln Electric's founder, John C. Lincoln, in 1946, based on his admiration for the work of Henry George. Today, the think tank still focuses on promoting "creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges." [11]
The Lincoln Electric Welding School was set up in 1917, and has since then instructed over 100,000 men and women in the various methods and techniques of safety and arc welding processes. The school is listed by the Ohio State Board of School and College Registration.[12]

Lincoln Electric is an American multinational and a global manufacturer of welding products, arc welding equipment, welding consumables, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment and robotic welding systems.
The Fortune 1000 company is headquartered in Euclid, Ohio, United States and has a worldwide network of distributors and sales offices covering more than 160 countries. It has 42 manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Latin America. It also operates manufacturing alliances and joint ventures in 19 countries.[1]
Lincoln Electric's business model was listed as one of the most studied by the Harvard Business School and has been featured in many case studies by other business schools around the world. Since 1975, eight cases have been written about Lincoln Electric by the Harvard Business School alone.[2]
The company reported over $2.9 billion sales in 2013, with sales from North America accounting for 50% of it. Lincoln has over 8500+ employees globally and 3000 in the United States alone. Among Lincoln Electric's subsidiaries is The Harris Products Group, which is a manufacturer of Welding Consumables, Gas Apparatus, and other Specialty Products. The Harris Products Group has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Ohio, California, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Italy.
The company was founded in 1895 by John C. Lincoln with a capital investment of $200 to make electric motors he had designed.[3]
History[edit]
1895[edit]

John C. Lincoln founded The Lincoln Electric Company with a capital investment of $200.00. The product: electric motors of his own design.

1900 - 1919[edit]

John C.'s younger brother, James F. Lincoln, joined the Company as a salesman in 1907. Meanwhile, the product line had been expanded to include battery chargers for electric automobiles. A welding set was first made by the Lincoln brothers in 1909. In 1911, Lincoln Electric introduced the first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world.
In 1914, wishing to concentrate on scientific investigation, John C. turned the reins of the Company over to James F. Lincoln. James F. introduced piecework pay and established the Employee Advisory Board, which includes elected representatives from every department and has met every two weeks ever since. By 1915, in a progressive effort for its time, Lincoln Electric employees were covered by group life insurance.
In 1916, The Lincoln Electric Company of Canada was incorporated to distribute the U.S. made products. The next year, The Lincoln Electric Welding School was founded. The school has trained more than 100,000 people since its inception in 1917.

1920 - 1939[edit]

Lincoln Electric's production of welders surpassed that of motors for the first time in 1922, making welding the company's primary business. In 1927, Lincoln Electric introduced the Fleetweld® 5 coated electrode which produced welds with 20 - 50% higher tensile strength and 100% greater ductility than those made with bare electrodes.
Lincoln Electric employees earned paid vacations, among the first in the nation, in 1923. The first Lincoln Electric employee stock ownership plan, one of the first in the country, was initiated in 1925. An employee suggestion program was implemented in 1929. Lincoln Electric employees received their first annual Incentive Bonus in 1934. While the average Lincoln Electric worker's pay more than doubled during the decade of the Great Depression, electrodes which had sold for $0.16/lb in 1929 were selling for less than $0.06/lb by 1942.
After working 12 years to perfect a ductile weld, John Lincoln created a patented flux which, for the first time, made a weld as flexible as steel.
The Procedure Handbook of Arc Welding Design and Practice, first published in 1933, is today in its 14th edition.[4] More than 500,000 copies of this book have been sold.[5] In 1936, The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation was founded as a nonprofit educational organization to advance arc welding as a leading materials joining process. That same year, a young salesman named William I. Miskoe was sent halfway around the world to establish The Lincoln Electric Company Pty. Ltd. in Australia.

1940 - 1949[edit]

World War II brought a dramatic expansion of Lincoln Electric's business, with welded ship hulls creating an enormous new market for arc welding products. After many Lincoln Electric workers were drafted, the company hired large numbers of women and minority factory workers for the first time. Motor production was suspended to focus resources on supporting the wartime welding product demand.

1950 - 1969[edit]

In 1951, Lincoln Electric constructed a modern plant with unique material handling capabilities in Euclid, Ohio. Lincoln Electric France SA was established in 1953 with the construction of a plant in Rouen, a short trip from Paris. Major innovations of the 1950s included the Jetweld fast-fill low hydrogen stick electrodes and Innershield® self-shielded flux-cored wire electrodes.
James F. Lincoln continued to enhance Incentive Management, adding a cost of living multiplier, formal merit rating, and guaranteed continuous employment. In 1959, John C. Lincoln died.
In the 1960s, motors returned to the company's product line with a new model featuring an extruded aluminum frame and automatically wound stator coils. James F. Lincoln died in 1965.

1970 - 1989[edit]

Lincoln Electric entered a new era of professional management with the promotions of George E. Willis to president and William Irrgang to chairman in 1972. The Mentor, Ohio, electrode plant was started up in 1977 to produce the company's domestic wire consumables products.
The early 1980s were a time of hardship, with Lincoln Electric's sales dropping 40 percent in response to the combined effects of inflation, sharply higher energy costs, and a national recession. Although guaranteed continuous employment received a severe test, not one Lincoln Electric employee was laid off for lack of work.
In 1986, George E. Willis was named chairman and Donald F. Hastings became president. Mr. Willis pursued an energetic course of foreign expansion; eventually, Lincoln Electric obtained a controlling interest in manufacturing operations located in 16 countries.

1990 - 1995[edit]

In, 1992, Mr. Hastings became chairman and Frederick W. Mackenbach was promoted to president. In 1991, an expanded world headquarters facility opened with expanded and renovated Weld Technology and training center operations. Foreign operations were consolidated and reorganized.
In 1993, during the global reorganization, Don Hastings and Fred Mackenbach urged the Company's U.S. employees to pursue record levels of production and sales. In true Lincoln Electric spirit, they responded by voluntarily postponing 614 weeks of vacation in order to meet customer demand for product. Sales records were set every quarter since mid-1993.
Lincoln Electric added more than 600 new employees during 1994. On June 8, 1995, the Company's Centennial year, a new motor facility opened. The Lincoln Electric Company achieved its one billion dollar sales goal during its centennial year.

1996[edit]

The board of directors appointed Anthony A. Massaro as President, succeeding the retiring Frederick W. Mackenbach. On November 1, Mr. Massaro was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hastings remained as Chairman until May, 1997.
A multimillion-dollar expansion and update of domestic research and development facilities was approved by the board. Expansion activities included an acquisition of Electronic Welding Systems (EWS) in Italy, a planned joint venture in China and a manufacturing joint venture in Jakarta, Indonesia.

1997[edit]

The Lincoln Electric Board of Directors announces the appointment of Anthony A. Massaro as chairman of the company, making him the sixth chairman. At the American Welding Society tradeshow in April, the company introduces many products resulting from a new product development process.

1998[edit]

1998 was a year of expansion, acquisition and product development for Lincoln Electric. In the global arena, Lincoln Electric opened an electrode plant in Shanghai, China and acquired Uhrhan & Schwill, of Essen, Germany, a designer and installer of pipe welding systems for pipe mills. In addition, Lincoln Electric secured its own aluminum wire capability and brand through acquisition of Canadian company, Indalco, a manufacturer of aluminum wire and rod. In other global happenings, Lincoln Electric secured a 50% stake in AS Kaynak, a leading Turkish producer of welding consumables and opened a distribution center in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Products abounded with more than 23 new products and services introduced to the market in 1998, including ArcLink the arc welding industry’s first communications protocol, at the annual American Welding Society Exposition.
In 1998, Lincoln Electric also distributed its 65th consecutive bonus to employees and achieved the fifth consecutive year of record financial performance. In investor news, shareholders approved the formation of a holding company, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. With this transition came a conversion from dual class stock (voting and non-voting) to a single-class, all voting stock. This action doubled the number of outstanding shares.

1999[edit]

In January 1999, Lincoln Electric established a majority-held, joint venture electrode plant in the Philippines with distributor partners. During the American Welding Society's International Welding and Fabricating Exposition in St. Louis, Lincoln unveiled some never-before-seen products including the Multi-Weld system, designed for welding large structures, and the Power MIG: The Professional Choice, 255 combination wire feeder/welder. Lincoln Electric also debuted a host of new electrodes.
Also in 1999, the company completed the sale of its motor business to the Marathon Division of Regal-Beloit, preserving Guaranteed Employment Policy through the process.

2000[edit]

Lincoln Electric acquires C.I.F.E. Spa, an Italian manufacturer of welding consumables and Europe’s premier producer of MIG wire. Production begins in Lincoln’s new manufacturing facility in Brazil.

2001[edit]

The Company expands its operations in South America with the acquisition of Messer Soldaduras de Venezuela, the country’s leading manufacturer of consumable welding products. The David C. Lincoln Technology Center is completed, ensuring Lincoln Electric’s leadership position in product development.

2002[edit]

The acquisition of Bester S.A., a welding equipment manufacturer based in Poland, drives the Company’s growth in Eastern Europe. The Company forms Lincoln Electric Welding, Cutting, Tools and Accessories, Inc., dedicated to growing the retail channel.

2003[edit]

Lincoln Electric acquires the Century and Marquette welding and battery charger brands.

2004[edit]

Acquisitions of controlling interests in three welding businesses in China are completed, giving Lincoln Electric a leading share of that growing market. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans visits Lincoln Electric’s Euclid headquarters, citing the Company as a prime example of America’s manufacturing strength.
John M. Stropki is named Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, becoming only the seventh Chairman in the Company’s history.

Lincoln Foundation, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and Lincoln Welding School[edit]
The J.F.Lincoln Foundation is a non-profit, welding education organization founded in 1936 to promote welding as a better method of joining metals and to promote welding as a career choice. It is the only organization in the United States solely dedicated to educating the public about the art and science of arc welding. Formed when the arc welding industry was in its infancy, the Foundation is now in its seventh decade of publishing educational texts and granting cash awards to recognize technical achievements.[10]
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established by Lincoln Electric's founder, John C. Lincoln, in 1946, based on his admiration for the work of Henry George. Today, the think tank still focuses on promoting "creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges." [11]
The Lincoln Electric Welding School was set up in 1917, and has since then instructed over 100,000 men and women in the various methods and techniques of safety and arc welding processes. The school is listed by the Ohio State Board of School and College Registration.[12]

Lincoln Electric is an American multinational and a global manufacturer of welding products, arc welding equipment, welding consumables, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment and robotic welding systems.
The Fortune 1000 company is headquartered in Euclid, Ohio, United States and has a worldwide network of distributors and sales offices covering more than 160 countries. It has 42 manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Latin America. It also operates manufacturing alliances and joint ventures in 19 countries.[1]
Lincoln Electric's business model was listed as one of the most studied by the Harvard Business School and has been featured in many case studies by other business schools around the world. Since 1975, eight cases have been written about Lincoln Electric by the Harvard Business School alone.[2]
The company reported over $2.9 billion sales in 2013, with sales from North America accounting for 50% of it. Lincoln has over 8500+ employees globally and 3000 in the United States alone. Among Lincoln Electric's subsidiaries is The Harris Products Group, which is a manufacturer of Welding Consumables, Gas Apparatus, and other Specialty Products. The Harris Products Group has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Ohio, California, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Italy.
The company was founded in 1895 by John C. Lincoln with a capital investment of $200 to make electric motors he had designed.[3]
History[edit]
1895[edit]

John C. Lincoln founded The Lincoln Electric Company with a capital investment of $200.00. The product: electric motors of his own design.

1900 - 1919[edit]

John C.'s younger brother, James F. Lincoln, joined the Company as a salesman in 1907. Meanwhile, the product line had been expanded to include battery chargers for electric automobiles. A welding set was first made by the Lincoln brothers in 1909. In 1911, Lincoln Electric introduced the first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world.
In 1914, wishing to concentrate on scientific investigation, John C. turned the reins of the Company over to James F. Lincoln. James F. introduced piecework pay and established the Employee Advisory Board, which includes elected representatives from every department and has met every two weeks ever since. By 1915, in a progressive effort for its time, Lincoln Electric employees were covered by group life insurance.
In 1916, The Lincoln Electric Company of Canada was incorporated to distribute the U.S. made products. The next year, The Lincoln Electric Welding School was founded. The school has trained more than 100,000 people since its inception in 1917.

1920 - 1939[edit]

Lincoln Electric's production of welders surpassed that of motors for the first time in 1922, making welding the company's primary business. In 1927, Lincoln Electric introduced the Fleetweld® 5 coated electrode which produced welds with 20 - 50% higher tensile strength and 100% greater ductility than those made with bare electrodes.
Lincoln Electric employees earned paid vacations, among the first in the nation, in 1923. The first Lincoln Electric employee stock ownership plan, one of the first in the country, was initiated in 1925. An employee suggestion program was implemented in 1929. Lincoln Electric employees received their first annual Incentive Bonus in 1934. While the average Lincoln Electric worker's pay more than doubled during the decade of the Great Depression, electrodes which had sold for $0.16/lb in 1929 were selling for less than $0.06/lb by 1942.
After working 12 years to perfect a ductile weld, John Lincoln created a patented flux which, for the first time, made a weld as flexible as steel.
The Procedure Handbook of Arc Welding Design and Practice, first published in 1933, is today in its 14th edition.[4] More than 500,000 copies of this book have been sold.[5] In 1936, The James F. Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation was founded as a nonprofit educational organization to advance arc welding as a leading materials joining process. That same year, a young salesman named William I. Miskoe was sent halfway around the world to establish The Lincoln Electric Company Pty. Ltd. in Australia.

1940 - 1949[edit]

World War II brought a dramatic expansion of Lincoln Electric's business, with welded ship hulls creating an enormous new market for arc welding products. After many Lincoln Electric workers were drafted, the company hired large numbers of women and minority factory workers for the first time. Motor production was suspended to focus resources on supporting the wartime welding product demand.

1950 - 1969[edit]

In 1951, Lincoln Electric constructed a modern plant with unique material handling capabilities in Euclid, Ohio. Lincoln Electric France SA was established in 1953 with the construction of a plant in Rouen, a short trip from Paris. Major innovations of the 1950s included the Jetweld fast-fill low hydrogen stick electrodes and Innershield® self-shielded flux-cored wire electrodes.
James F. Lincoln continued to enhance Incentive Management, adding a cost of living multiplier, formal merit rating, and guaranteed continuous employment. In 1959, John C. Lincoln died.
In the 1960s, motors returned to the company's product line with a new model featuring an extruded aluminum frame and automatically wound stator coils. James F. Lincoln died in 1965.

1970 - 1989[edit]

Lincoln Electric entered a new era of professional management with the promotions of George E. Willis to president and William Irrgang to chairman in 1972. The Mentor, Ohio, electrode plant was started up in 1977 to produce the company's domestic wire consumables products.
The early 1980s were a time of hardship, with Lincoln Electric's sales dropping 40 percent in response to the combined effects of inflation, sharply higher energy costs, and a national recession. Although guaranteed continuous employment received a severe test, not one Lincoln Electric employee was laid off for lack of work.
In 1986, George E. Willis was named chairman and Donald F. Hastings became president. Mr. Willis pursued an energetic course of foreign expansion; eventually, Lincoln Electric obtained a controlling interest in manufacturing operations located in 16 countries.

1990 - 1995[edit]

In, 1992, Mr. Hastings became chairman and Frederick W. Mackenbach was promoted to president. In 1991, an expanded world headquarters facility opened with expanded and renovated Weld Technology and training center operations. Foreign operations were consolidated and reorganized.
In 1993, during the global reorganization, Don Hastings and Fred Mackenbach urged the Company's U.S. employees to pursue record levels of production and sales. In true Lincoln Electric spirit, they responded by voluntarily postponing 614 weeks of vacation in order to meet customer demand for product. Sales records were set every quarter since mid-1993.
Lincoln Electric added more than 600 new employees during 1994. On June 8, 1995, the Company's Centennial year, a new motor facility opened. The Lincoln Electric Company achieved its one billion dollar sales goal during its centennial year.

1996[edit]

The board of directors appointed Anthony A. Massaro as President, succeeding the retiring Frederick W. Mackenbach. On November 1, Mr. Massaro was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hastings remained as Chairman until May, 1997.
A multimillion-dollar expansion and update of domestic research and development facilities was approved by the board. Expansion activities included an acquisition of Electronic Welding Systems (EWS) in Italy, a planned joint venture in China and a manufacturing joint venture in Jakarta, Indonesia.

1997[edit]

The Lincoln Electric Board of Directors announces the appointment of Anthony A. Massaro as chairman of the company, making him the sixth chairman. At the American Welding Society tradeshow in April, the company introduces many products resulting from a new product development process.

1998[edit]

1998 was a year of expansion, acquisition and product development for Lincoln Electric. In the global arena, Lincoln Electric opened an electrode plant in Shanghai, China and acquired Uhrhan & Schwill, of Essen, Germany, a designer and installer of pipe welding systems for pipe mills. In addition, Lincoln Electric secured its own aluminum wire capability and brand through acquisition of Canadian company, Indalco, a manufacturer of aluminum wire and rod. In other global happenings, Lincoln Electric secured a 50% stake in AS Kaynak, a leading Turkish producer of welding consumables and opened a distribution center in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Products abounded with more than 23 new products and services introduced to the market in 1998, including ArcLink the arc welding industry’s first communications protocol, at the annual American Welding Society Exposition.
In 1998, Lincoln Electric also distributed its 65th consecutive bonus to employees and achieved the fifth consecutive year of record financial performance. In investor news, shareholders approved the formation of a holding company, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. With this transition came a conversion from dual class stock (voting and non-voting) to a single-class, all voting stock. This action doubled the number of outstanding shares.

1999[edit]

In January 1999, Lincoln Electric established a majority-held, joint venture electrode plant in the Philippines with distributor partners. During the American Welding Society's International Welding and Fabricating Exposition in St. Louis, Lincoln unveiled some never-before-seen products including the Multi-Weld system, designed for welding large structures, and the Power MIG: The Professional Choice, 255 combination wire feeder/welder. Lincoln Electric also debuted a host of new electrodes.
Also in 1999, the company completed the sale of its motor business to the Marathon Division of Regal-Beloit, preserving Guaranteed Employment Policy through the process.

Lincoln Foundation, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and Lincoln Welding School[edit]
The J.F.Lincoln Foundation is a non-profit, welding education organization founded in 1936 to promote welding as a better method of joining metals and to promote welding as a career choice. It is the only organization in the United States solely dedicated to educating the public about the art and science of arc welding. Formed when the arc welding industry was in its infancy, the Foundation is now in its seventh decade of publishing educational texts and granting cash awards to recognize technical achievements.[10]
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established by Lincoln Electric's founder, John C. Lincoln, in 1946, based on his admiration for the work of Henry George. Today, the think tank still focuses on promoting "creative approaches to land as a solution to economic, social, and environmental challenges." [11]
The Lincoln Electric Welding School was set up in 1917, and has since then instructed over 100,000 men and women in the various methods and techniques of safety and arc welding processes. The school is listed by the Ohio State Board of School and College Registration.[12]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.
