Our Approach

Sageview provides growth capital to small and mid-sized companies in the technology, financial services, and business services sectors. We combine active ownership, industry experience and a partnership approach to drive long-term value for our portfolio companies and investors.READ MORE



Working with Sageview


“We were looking for a capital partner that was different from the other firms we had interacted with, and Sageview’s approach stood out.  They have been engaged in nearly every aspect of our business – strategic discussions, executive hires, financial planning and monitoring, operational efficiency, board composition to name a few – and have constructively supported our growth initiatives.  They are an important part of Avalara’s success.”Scott McFarlane, CEO, Avalara
“Sageview has brought practical, straight-forward thinking to help grow GoPro and take it to the next level.  They know when to be deeply involved and when to apply a deft touch, and have been committed partners since day one.”Nick Woodman, CEO, GoPro
“We’ve worked with many investors over the years and what makes Sageview unique is their approach beyond economics. Their principals make a significant personal investment both financially and intellectually and care deeply about driving the best outcome for all. Their exceptional knowledge of our business to its core, experience and perspective is helping us grow and evolve into one of the dominant and most innovative brands in the wealth counseling business.”Joe Duran, CEO, United Capital
“We chose to partner with Sageview because of their ability to help us grow our business, and their engaged approach was evident from day 1. They helped us map the investments we need to scale the business, then helped us achieve that scale by introducing us to potential Fortune 500 customers.”Prashanth Palakurthi, CEO, Reflexis
“Sageview invested in EverBank in the depth of the financial crisis in 2008.  Making an investment at that time is a testament to the work they put in to understand the business and the management team and our vision for growth.  Since then we have grown from a $6 billion institution to nearly $20 billion today.  Along the way, we have benefited from Sageview’s years of investment experience and board leadership.”Rob Clements, CEO, EverBank
“The team at Sageview has taken a leadership role on the Exaro board from day one, working seamlessly with  management and our other investors.  They have been instrumental in helping us think through various strategic opportunities by combining a rigorous analytical approach and nuanced understanding of the E&P business with the benefit of years of experience as business owners.”Chris Beato, CEO, Exaro
“I joined Cadence when it was started in large part due to Sageview’s involvement. They bring more than capital to the table – they are part of the team and  have an invaluable network.  They have deep experience and expertise and have been tremendously supportive of our management team.  It is valuable for me to have Sageview as a sounding board – it helps me make better decisions. It’s a strong partnership.”Paul Murphy, CEO, CadencePrev

Strategy
November 7th, 2013

Strategy
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services.
Focus on Select Growth Industries
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services. These industries are characterized by above-GDP growth trends and a large number of small and mid-sized companies, creating a robust opportunity set in which attractive investment returns can be achieved without the use of excessive financial leverage.  Sageview’s investment team has deep industry experience and a strong track record in these verticals.
Proactive and Proprietary Sourcing
Sageview focuses primarily on minority investments and other opportunities where governance or structure often fall outside the mandates of traditional private equity and venture capital funds. Sageview’s extensive global relationship network is a valuable sourcing engine, and the majority of our investments are proprietary in nature, with Sageview as the lead or only investor and a member of the Board of Directors.
Asymmetric Risk-Return
Sageview pursues a rigorous underwriting approach that prioritizes capital preservation and risk-mitigation, while maintaining attractive upside optionality.  Sources of downside protection might include recurring cash flow, tangible asset values, structural protections, hedging, or other means.  By investing in equity and equity like securities, Sageview maintains exposure to upside performance.
Active Approach to Ownership
Sageview targets a portfolio of 15-20 total investments, enabling the firm to concentrate efforts on opportunities where Sageview’s capital, expertise and active involvement can have a meaningful impact on value creation.   Sageview looks to partner with founders and management teams who have a demonstrated track record of success, a clear strategy for value creation, and incentives that are aligned with those of other shareholders.
Opportunistic Investing in Public Markets
Sageview opportunistically invests in public companies and special situations, consistent with the firm’s history and experience.  Our focus is primarily on situations where we can be an engaged, impactful anchor shareholder to small and mid-cap public companies.

“Our mission has always been focused on helping our clients succeed by offering exceptional products, and responsive customer service,” said Glen Demetrioff, who founded DMT. “We’ve built a thriving, growing business and we’re ready for the next level. This investment increases our ability to supercharge our R&D efforts and fast track the development of our industry-leading solutions in the area of real-time communication. We believe that Sageview has the domain expertise, resources and shared vision to help us reach our goals for product evolution and market expansion.”
“DMT is very well positioned as a market leader within the rapidly expanding automotive lead management category,” said Scott Stuart, partner at Sageview Capital. “Sageview is focused on providing growth capital to innovative entrepreneurs and bringing our experience to bear in helping them build category-defining businesses. DMT has all the ingredients for a lasting independent company – a proven market opportunity, breakthrough technology and phenomenal management team.”
As part of this investment, Stuart and Sageview partner Jeff Klemens have joined the DMT board of directors, which also includes Glen Demetrioff, founder and CEO, Sharon Demetrioff, co-founder, and Don Lundgren, principal of INSI Management Services. The controlling majority of DMT resides with the founders. Sageview will hold a minority stake in the company.
DMT’s focus on the automotive sector, deep customer relationships, and history of product innovation has resulted in profitable, double-digit growth, year-after-year while maintaining exceptional OEM and dealership retention.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
