 From Now On CD music Product Description

From Now On album for sale by David Rector was released May 23, 2015 on the David Rector label. One of my biggest fans, Fannie Tyler called me after I sent her a preview of the CD, From Now On and said, "I played, I Wonder four times back to back. From Now On buy CD music If I didn't have a appointment to go to I would have played it a 5th. From Now On songs After I got out of my appointment I played it all the way home." From Now On album for sale Donald Boyette said, "Now the men have a man that sings, Ain't No Way for us. From Now On CD music Ain't No Way is magnificent. From Now On buy CD music Not too many people would have the courage to take on the great Aretha Franklin." Yvette Gunn said, "I can't stop playing, Ain't No Way." Nancy Cochran of the South Fulton Neighbor reported, "I thought that I'd play the first song and then skip from one track to the next, but I played all 14 songs back to back. Just when I thought that he couldn't perform a song better than the last song played David's orchestration was only a preview to another great performance."

Editorial Reviews


South Carolina  - Franklin Evans
The laughter and humor, combined with a realistic storyline, hold the reader's attention from page to page and chapter to chapter.  Other characters such as Reverend Gold and Carmen only add zest to this exciting piece of literature of love, romance, and self-discovery.  It is a must-read that will be enjoyed from beginning to end.  Without question, Rector has proven that he is an author with a bright and promising future!
