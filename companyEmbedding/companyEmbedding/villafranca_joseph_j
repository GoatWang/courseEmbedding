 Educational Background



 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.

                  The State University of New York is the largest comprehensive university system in the United States, educating approximately 468,000 students in more than 7,500 degree and certificate programs, and more than 1.8 million NYS citizens in professional development and personal enrichment programs, on 64 college and university campuses. There are nearly 3 million SUNY alumni worldwide.

              Abstract




The goal of this research proposal is to understand the structure and mechanism of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and peptidyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). The former enzyme, DBH, is responsible for the formation of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter, from dopamine. The latter enzyme, PAM, is responsible for the production of bioactive peptide hormones. Both are classified as Cu(II)-activated monooxygenases and they use O2 and ascorbate as cosubstrates. 
The specific aims  with DBH are as follows: 1) to determine the nature of the """"""""activated"""""""" oxygen species and copper centers in the chemical mechanism using alternate substrates, mechanism-based inhibitors and spectroscopic methods (EPR, spin-echo EPR, EXAFS). 2) to isolate and determine the structure of the enzyme adducts (peptides) formed upon inactivation of DBH by several classes of mechanism-based inhibitors. 3) to determine the nature of the """"""""transition-state"""""""" in the C-H bond activation step by determining the intrinsic isotope effect for a series of ring- substituted phenethylamine substrates. 4) to clone DBH, determine the primary amino acid sequence of the enzyme from the DNA sequence and express the active enzyme. 
The specific aims  with PAM as follows: 1) to establish the role of O2 in the initial oxidation reaction. Isotopically labeled (180)O2 and (180)O2 and (18o)H2O will be used to determine if the terminal gly residue of peptides is hydroxylated in the initial step or whether the gly undergoes dehydrogenation (-2H.) by a cofactor followed by hydrolysis of an imine intermediate. 2) to establish stereochemistry of the hydrogen abstraction step by using chirally labeled (R)-3H and (s)-3H gly terminated peptides. 3) to synthesize several alpha-substituted (terminal) gly containing peptides as potential mechanism-based inhibitors with the intention of a) determining mechanistic steps in the reaction and b) isolating and identifying active site amino acid residues. 4) to improve the purification of the enzyme by isolating monoclonal antibodies to PAM for the preparation of antibody-linked Sepharose columns. 5) to establish the stoichiometry of peptide substrate, O2, and ascorbate in the formation of alpha-amide containing peptide and glyoxylate. The role of copper in the reaction will be studied by EPR methods.

 The Company at the Crossroads. Part 1: To Commercialize or Not?BioPharm International - Sep 01, 2008Every biotech company reaches a point in its development where it must decide what path it will take after it passes the start-up phase. This article discusses what the company must consider to decide what business model it will follow. How to Avoid Becoming a Biotech Zombie Part 1BioPharm International - Jan 01, 2008Biotechs can avoid becoming a zombie by having a thorough business plan and a clear focus. Preparing for Your First IND Submission: The Devil is in the DetailsBioPharm International - Jan 01, 2008In the process of developing breakthrough biopharmaceuticals with profound therapeutic promise, the many detailed requirements for a successful investigational new drug (IND) submission may seem petty, but they are not. With an IND, you are essentially moving from the cloistered world of the laboratory into a highly regulated industry where details not only matter, but are also greatly magnified by the overriding requirements of safety and efficacy. Treat those details with forethought and you will eventually succeed. Treat them as an afterthought and all of your pioneering science, state-of-the-art technology, and therapeutic ambition could come to nothing. At the very least, your progress to market could be delayed significantly. And if, like most young biopharmaceutical companies, you are on a short financial leash, such delays can be fatal for securing additional funding.
