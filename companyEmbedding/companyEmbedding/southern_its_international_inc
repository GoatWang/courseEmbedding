Southern ITS International, Inc. (DBA Evolution Enterprises, Inc.) Announces That Evolution Enterprises LLC Has Exceeded Its Revenue Objectives For 2017 Q2 By 40%






GlobeNewswire



Jul 19, 2017 9:16 AM EDT













 




























































 Las Vegas, July 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Southern ITS International, Inc. (DBA Evolution Enterprises, Inc.) announces that Evolution Enterprises LLC has exceeded its revenue objectives for 2017 Q2 by 40%                  Evo Travel Logo            LAS VEGAS, NV--(GlobeNewswire - July 19, 2017) - Evolution Enterprises, Inc. ("SITS") (OTC PINKSHEETS: SITS) announced today that the Company acquired in a recent reverse merger with SITS, Evolution Enterprises LLC (June 30, 2017), has exceeded its Q2 2017 gross revenue projections by 40%.  Evolution Enterprises LLC posted monthly gross revenue during Q2 2017 of $1.4m (April), $1.3m (May), and $1.5m (June). The Company posted actual combined gross revenue of $7.2m for Q1/Q2 2017 exceeding semi-annual projection $6.0M by 21.6%. Company Q2 2017 projections of $3.0m gross revenue were exceeded by 40% with actual gross revenue posted at $4.2m.  Q2 2017 actual gross revenue of $4.2m compared against Q1 2017 levels at $3.0m indicates a $1.3m surge in actual gross revenue quarter to quarter. Q1/Q2 combined actual gross revenue of special importance in light of the Company's projected total annual gross revenue for the fiscal year was $12.0M.  With nearly two full operating quarters left, the Company is tracking toward exceeding its projections.  David McCovy, Chairman and founder of Evolution, stated "We are exceptionally proud of our entire membership team as they have driven our revenue beyond stated targets, surpassing those targets by over 40% quarter on quarter during this first-half of a very successful fiscal year. We have exceeded gross revenues, number of members added and net profits for the first half of 2017.  Our new objective for the Evolution Travel division is to finish 2017 with $15 million in gross revenue, which will be our second full year of operations.  We are now a recognized force in the 8.3 trillion global travel industry and we achieved it in a record time."
