Kenneth A. Bronfin Joins Hearst New Media & Technology as Deputy Group Head

Published on 06.12.96



Share This Page










NEW YORK, June 13,
1996 – Kenneth A. Bronfin will join Hearst New Media & Technology on
June 19 as Deputy Group Head. The appointment was announced today by Alfred C.
Sikes, president of Hearst New Media & Technology, a division of The Hearst
Corporation. "Ken Bronfin has an excellent track record of conceiving
and implementing ambitious interactive media projects," Sikes said.
"His experience encompasses both technology and content, and his proven
skills developed within a major media company will be valuable to Hearst New
Media." Bronfin was general manager of NBC Data Network, a division
of NBC, Inc., and vice president of NBC Cable and Business Development. The NBC
Data Network division, formed in 1994, is responsible for guiding NBC's entry
into digital television and other digital broadcast delivery mediums. Among
other projects, Bronfin supervised NBC's efforts in a partnership with Intel
Corporation to develop the Intercast PC-TV medium, which will use the NBC
Television Network to deliver multimedia information over-the-air to personal
computer users nationwide. Previously, Bronfin was director of business development for
the NBC Technology Group and, before that, was director of NBC's Broadcast
Engineering and Operations Group. He joined NBC as a management associate.
Bronfin began his career as a project manager for Tano Corporation, a New
Orleans-based manufacturer of computer systems for large ships. Bronfin holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
from the University of Virginia and an MBA in management from the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania. Hearst New Media & Technology is the creator of HomeArts
(http://homearts.com), which provides an editorial and feature-rich service
over the Internet about the home and home life. The Division's Hearst New Media
Center produces and markets services for the Internet. Hearst, through its New Media & Technology Division, is
an investor in Books That Work, Inc., a producer of three-dimensional,
home-related CD-ROMs; KidSoft, L.L.C., a direct marketer of children's software
products; Netscape Communications Corp., an Internet software producer; I/Pro,
a provider of Web measurement and analysis; and New Century Network, a
consortium of the nation's leading newspapers developing interactive services
for newspapers. The Hearst Corporation is one of the largest diversified
communications companies in the nation. Its 12 daily and six non-daily
newspapers are among the largest groups in that industry, and its 16 consumer
magazines make Hearst the largest publisher of monthly magazines in the world.
The Company also operates six radio and seven television stations and the
Hearst Book Group. Hearst syndicates newspaper comics and features; produces
and distributes television programming, both domestically and internationally;
and publishes multimedia software for the new media technologies. Hearst is a pioneer in cable television as a founding
partner in the Lifetime, A&E and The History Channel cable networks. The
Company is also a partner in ESPN and ESPN2. Hearst publishes nine monthly magazines in the United
Kingdom through its wholly owned subsidiary, The National Magazine Company
Limited. Hearst Magazines International publishes nearly 70 editions, through
partnerships, joint ventures and licensees, in 16 languages for distribution in
over 80 countries.

Kenneth A. Bronfin is one of
the key forces behind Hearst's transformation from traditional media company to
interactive media leader. Bronfin is a senior managing director for Hearst
Ventures, a team that makes strategic investments in companies operating at the
intersection of media and technology. His primary focus is on the division’s
international investments, and he sits on the boards of several Hearst
Ventures’ portfolio companies.According to Bronfin, Hearst’s interactive philosophy is unique among traditional media companies in that Hearst is building a large portfolio of businesses that leverage the rich media resources of Hearst and each other. “Hearst is much more than a financial investor. We are a partner with many of these portfolio companies—working with them on promotion, sales and development,” he says. “They find big value in integrating their new media assets with Hearst’s media properties and find strength in the fact that Hearst will be there with them as a partner and backer, independent of the variations inherent in the internet public equity market.”Bronfin's education and career experience in technology made him a natural choice to lead Hearst into the world of electronic media. He joined Hearst in June 1996. Prior to joining Hearst, he was with NBC, as a founder of the Interactive Media Group as well as general manager of NBC’s digital television group and vice president of NBC Cable and Business Development. Bronfin was also head of business development for NBC Technology and was director of NBC's Broadcast Engineering Group, which was responsible for the research and development associated with NBC’s technical infrastructure. He joined NBC as part of its Management Associate Program.Bronfin holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia and an MBA in management from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He also holds patents in the field of television technology.
