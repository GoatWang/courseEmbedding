PogoTec, Inc. Key Developments

PogoTec Announces Introduction of PogoLoop
Mar 31 17
PogoTec announced the introduction of PogoLoop, a proprietary adapter that allows almost all eyewear to attach PogoCam, attachable eyewear camera. With PogoLoop, it’s possible to attach PogoCam to user current eyeglass frame or to other new eyeglass frames not equipped with PogoTrack. First unveiled at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, PogoCam is designed to magnetically attach to frames equipped with PogoTrack, a proprietary platform that maintains the fashion look of eyewear. PogoTrack will also support the attachment of future electronic wearable devices beyond the PogoCam camera. PogoLoop is a newly developed method of attaching electronic wearable devices to eyewear. It is a proprietary, patent-pending universal connector easily installed by opticians and consumers that supports the magnetic attachment of PogoCam and future eye wearables to almost all frames available on the market today. PogoLoop can remain attached to one’s eyeglass frame, thus providing the ability to quickly attach a camera for those photo moments one does not want to miss. It can also be removed and reinstalled as desired.


PogoTec Appoints John Blake as Senior Director of Optical Channel
Mar 31 17
PogoTec announced the appointment of John Blake as Senior Director of the Optical channel. John will work to bring awareness of PogoTec products to the optical industry and implement product sales in vision care offices across the country. Before joining PogoTec, Blake served for more than 40 years at the Italian frame manufacturer and distributor, Safilo. John most recently served as sales director for Safilo overseeing 100 professionals in 20 state territories.


Vista Eyewear Announces Strategic Partnership with PogoTec
Jan 4 17
Vista Eyewear announced a strategic partnership with PogoTec to design and manufacture eyewear featuring the PogoTrack™ wearable technology platform. Eyewear with PogoTrack is designed to serve as a universal platform for a wide range of future electronic wearable devices. Unveiled for the first time at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, the first such device is PogoCam™, the world’s smallest wearable camera that attaches to fashionable eyewear. Future wearables for the platform may include an alertness monitor to prevent drivers from falling asleep and a UV meter to prevent sunburn by alerting users when exposed to damaging rays. Partnering with PogoTec to incorporate PogoTrack capability into modern Italian handmade frames creates a unique combination of beauty, design and technology.

PogoTec™ Launch to Target 100,000 Retail Locations Globally



Share Article


















PogoTec™ is targeting the initial launch of its proprietary products at Vision Expo East (VEE) 2017 in New York City,







PogoTec™

We are very pleased with well- known brands and quality companies who will partner with us for our launch.


Roanoke, VA (PRWEB)
April 13, 2016
 PogoTec™ Inc. http://www.PogoTec.com announced today that it has lined up channel partners with the opportunity to launch PogoTec™ licensed products into approximately 100,000 retail locations around the world. Non-licensed products will be sold on the PogoTec™ planned ecommerce website. PogoTec™ is targeting the initial launch of its proprietary products at Vision Expo East (VEE) 2017 in New York City and will continue to line up additional license partners for 2017 and 2018. 
PogoTec™ operates at the nexus of 4 huge, global multi-billion dollar growing markets. These markets are; 1) electronic wearable devices (EWDs), 2) wireless power, 3) wearable cameras and 4) eyewear. The EWD market is experiencing explosive growth (43% CAGR) and is projected to grow from today’s $8 Billion annual sales to $75 Billion annual sales in less than 10 years. The wireless power market is forecast to grow rapidly from $2 Billion to $8 Billion annual sales in less than 5 years. The wearable camera market is forecast to grow from 12 Million wearable cameras shipped today to 30 Million in less than 5 years. Today’s eyewear market generates approximately 300 Million new pairs of eyewear sales each year globally, with approximately 2 Billion eyeglass wearers worldwide. This does not include non- prescription sunglasses. 
Dr. Ron Blum, Founder and President of PogoTec™ stated, "We are very pleased with well- known brands and quality companies who will partner with us for our launch. We intend to introduce these partners and our innovative products at the Consumer Electronics’ Show’s Press Event (Show Stoppers) held in Las Vegas in January, 2017. These channel partners provide broad coverage across optical shops, eye care professional offices, the mass market, department stores and sporting goods stores.” 
Several weeks ago, PogoTec™ unveiled its proprietary Pogo-Track™; a standardized track that allows electronic wearable devices (EWDs) to be easily and conveniently attached to prescription and non-prescription eyewear while preserving the design integrity of the frame.   Examples of EWDs that can be easily attached to eyewear include an ultraviolet meter, alertness monitor, pedometer, GPS, wearable camera, infra-red sensor, air quality sensor, radiation detector, audio device, heads up display and hearing aids.  The proprietary Pogo-Track™ feature can appear as an accent color or be designed to blend with the color of the eyeglass frame that will be virtually imperceptible to the wearer. Pogo-Track™ does not add to the thickness or weight of the eyewear. This allows Pogo-Track™ eyewear to be sold as an attractive option for all consumers, even if an EWD is not attached to the frame.   
PogoTec™ has also invented, developed, and plans to commercialize in 2017: Pogo-Power™ a proprietary mobile wireless power system designed specifically for EWDs and Pogo-Cam™ - the world’s smallest “look and shoot” camera attachable to eyewear.  PogoTec™ has been very diligent in protecting its intellectual property. To date, PogoTec™ has filed over 100 provisional patent applications covering its product offerings that will be combined into numerous comprehensive patent applications. 
“PogoTec™ is poised to provide unprecedented advantages to the fast-growing electronic wearable device market” said Read Ziegler, Managing Partner of Vantedge Group and a PogoTec™ board member. “PogoTec™ has a broad and distinguished set of partners to help ensure these advantages reach consumers through their purchase channel of choice.” 
About PogoTec™ Inc 
PogoTec™ Inc is a privately owned company incorporated in Delaware. Its core initiative is to enable electronic wearable devices with a special focus on eyewear. PogoTec™ product offerings consist of, Pogo-Track™ - a proprietary attachment means for attaching electronic wearable devices to eyewear while maintaining the fashion look of eyewear, Pogo-Cam™ - the world’s smallest “look and shoot” camera attachable to eyewear, and Pogo-Power™ - a unique wireless power transfer system for powering / charging electronic wearable devices of all types. The PogoTec™ management team and Board of Directors have extensive experience in creating and commercializing innovation. PogoTec™ has been extremely diligent in protecting its intellectual property and has numerous patent applications filed. For more information about PogoTec™, please visit http://www.PogoTec.com

Pogo-Track™ Connects Electronic Wearable Devices to Eyewear while Preserving Design Integrity







Pogo-Track™

Eyewear provides the perfect location for Electronic Wearable Devices since it is located close to one’s key senses; sight, hearing, smell and taste.


Roanoke, VA (PRWEB)
March 23, 2016
 PogoTec™, Inc. (http://www.PogoTec.com) unveiled its proprietary Pogo-Track™ today. Pogo-Track™ is a standardized track that allows electronic wearable devices (EWDs) to be easily and conveniently attached to prescription and non-prescription eyewear while preserving design integrity and fashion style. Examples of EWDs that can be easily attached to eyewear include a: UV meter, alertness monitor, pedometer, GPS, wearable camera, IR sensor, air quality sensor, radiation detector, audio device, heads up display and hearing aid just to mention a few.
The standardized Pogo-Track™ can be designed to match or blend with the color of the eyeglass frame or utilized as an accent color. Pogo-Track™ does not add to the thickness or weight of the eyewear.  The proprietary track appears as a design element incorporated into both eyewear temples and is virtually imperceptible to the wearer. This allows eyewear with Pogo-Tracks™ to be sold as an attractive option for all consumers, regardless of their intent to attach EWDs. 
The electronic wearable device (EWD) industry is forecast to grow from today’s ~$8.0 Billion to ~$75.0 Billion in less than 10 years.  In terms of units, the EWD industry is forecast to grow from today’s ~80 Million units shipped globally to over ~500 Million units by 2021. Within the eyewear industry there are ~300 Million pairs of new eyewear sold each year globally and there are presently ~ 2 Billion eyeglass wearers in the world today.  
Dr. Ron Blum, Founder and President of PogoTec™ stated, "Eyewear provides the perfect location for EWDs since it is located close to one’s key senses; sight, hearing, smell and taste.  In addition, eyewear is conveniently located for monitoring one’s mood, alertness, movement, location, health and the safety of the immediate environment.  By applying EWDs to eyewear everyone wins; the consumer, the eyewear industry and the EWD industry”.
In addition to Pogo-Track, PogoTec™ has also invented, developed and plans to commercialize in 2017 Pogo-Power™ (a proprietary mobile wireless power system for EWDs) and Pogo-Cam™ (the world’s smallest look and shoot camera attachable and detachable to / from eyewear).  PogoTec™ has been very diligent in protecting its intellectual property.  To date PogoTec™ has filed over 100 provisional patent applications covering its product offerings that will be combined into numerous comprehensive patent applications. 
Dr. Richard Clompus, VP of communication at PogoTec™ stated, “Pogo-Track™ has been designed with one standardized track for all eyewear.  By having one standardized track it is believed that EWD companies will find it easy to develop devices to attach to eyewear, while also significantly increasing the value of eyewear for the consumer”.  Dr. Clompus further stated, “Eyewear represents an untapped 2 Billion unit market for EWD companies and we believe EWDs can be a catalyst of new growth for the Optical Industry”.  
PogoTec™ is presently licensing eyewear companies with Pogo-Track™.  The company anticipates launching its product offerings in 2017 with multiple well known eyewear companies and brands. Presently, PogoTec™ has lined up a variety of eyewear companies in support of having its product offerings available (within the first year of launch) in the following channels across the US and in some cases around the world: eye care professional offices, high end department stores, certain sporting goods stores and the mass market.
