Mangrove Information
Fund Information







Mangrove Partners is a value-oriented investment manager. Our investment objective is to organically compound net worth while minimizing the chances of a permanent loss of capital.






The Mangrove Name
Mangroves are a shrub and tree species that are remarkably tough. Most live on muddy soil, but some also grow on sand, peat, and coral rock. They live in water up to 100 times saltier than most other plants can tolerate. Growing where land and water meet, mangroves bear the brunt of ocean-borne storms and hurricanes. Similarly, Mangrove Partners seeks to be resilient in its hostile environment, the financial markets.

Mangrove Capital leads $12 mln round for Moov


October 20, 2016
By Iris Dorbian






San Francisco-based Moov, a provider of a wearable that helps users during workouts, has raised $12 million in Series B financing. Mangrove Capital led the round with participation from BOE Technology Group.
PRESS RELEASE
SAN MATEO, CA (October 19, 2016) – Forty minutes at the gym might feel like a sufficient workout, but unless you’re pushing through every squat, burpee and sprint within your target heart rate zone, you’re doing it all wrong. That’s why Moov, the company that introduced AI-powered voice coaching, is launching the first wearable that guides you through a variety of calorie-torching, high intensity workouts based on heart rate with Moov HR™. Designed to be worn on the head as either a sweatband (Moov HR Sweat™) or swim cap (Moov HR Swim™), Moov HR™ is a tiny, lightweight sensor that monitors heart rate with the utmost accuracy to optimize every workout.
While they might be all the rage, wrist-worn heart rate monitors are prone to false reads due to muscle constriction, sweat, and even light. Developed by ex-Apple and Microsoft engineers, Moov HR’s PulseVision™ technology uses LED lights and optical sensors to measure blood density around the temples (tested at University of California, San Francisco’s Human Performance Center against EKG machines), which determines heart rate with ultra-fine precision.
From there, Moov’s real-time audio feedback coaches you through a variety of HIIT workouts within your target heart rate zone — or the upper limit of what your cardiovascular system can handle during physical activity — so that you can burn more calories in less time, and melt fat long after your workout is complete. 





“Accuracy is critical for efficient training based on heart rate zones, and too many wearables that claim to measure heart rate give false reads. If you’re basing your workouts on the wrong HR data, you’re probably over or under training” said Moov’s co-founder and CEO, Meng Li. “After extensive research and testing, we’ve determined that the best location for accurate pulse reading is the head. That’s why we’ve developed technology around these findings, so that anyone, regardless of their fitness level or goals, can get the most out of every workout for a fraction of the cost other wearables and gyms charge.”
See how Moov HR™ coaches you through workouts based on heart rate by watching the video here: http://bit.ly/2editqa
Moov HR™ is compatible with the Moov Personal Coach app (available on iOS and Android) and will launch with all new heart-rate driven, move-by-move voice coaching experiences in HIIT Run, HIIT Indoor Cycling and Bodyweight Circuit programs that focus on isolation and mobility to build strength. In all other Moov workouts, which includes Swim, Outdoor Cycling, and Cardio Boxing, Moov HR™ will serve as a heart rate monitor measuring beats per minute (BPMs) without the heart rate based HIIT audio coaching.
Other features and benefits of Moov HR:
EKG-level Accuracy: Moov HR is the first heart rate monitor app experience to show how your heart rate appears in both waveform representation (like an EKG line seen on hospital monitors) and numerical data. 





Customizable: Choose between Moov HR Sweat™ and Moov HR Swim™ to get the most out of every workout — both in and out of water.
Social: Stay competitive by sharing accomplishments on the Moov Leaderboard™. After completing any Moov HR™ Workout, your workout report can be shared freely across any channel of social media.
Affordable: Moov HR can be purchased as either a headband or swim cap for a limited-time pricing of $59.95 (buy both for only $99.90 while supplies last) so that anyone can get the most out of their workouts without having to join a gym or hire a personal trainer.
In addition to launching their third product in less than three years, Moov has secured $12 million in Series B financing led by Mangrove Capital and joined by BOE Technology Group. “As with their first two products, Moov is creating an entirely new wearable experience that provides actionable data in line with the current fitness trends,” said Stanley Wang, founding partner at Mangrove Capital. “People have savvied up to what constitutes a good workout and are flocking to boutique gyms where professionals coach them through high-intensity workouts. It’s not about tracking steps, but basing workouts on physiological patterns like heart rate, and Moov’s technology is delivering on just that.”
For a limited time only, Moov HR™ is available for purchase as either a headband or swim cap at $59.95 each. Take part in Moov’s special launch price and get both for $99.90 while supplies last. To purchase your device and choice of headband, Moov HR Sweat™ (headband) or Moov HR Swim™ (swim cap), please visit: www.moov.cc/MoovHr

By combining artificial intelligence and gameplay into wearable devices, including Moov, Moov Now, and Moov HR, Moov is fitness training taken to the next level.

Mangrove Capital Raises $170 Million for Startups, Not Sell Outs - Bloomberg






























































  
















There’s an Investor Raising Money for Startups That Don’t Sell Out
By Jeremy Kahn

                Fund is the fifth for the Luxembourg-based venture firm
            



                Past successes include investments in Skype, Wix.com
            



Mangrove Capital Partners, the Luxembourg-based venture capital firm, has raised a $170 million fund to invest in European startups. But its outspoken founder has no interest in startups looking for a quick buck.The fund, which is Mangrove’s fifth since its founding 17 years ago, will invest in early stage companies, said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Tluszcz in an interview.Mangrove was one of the first investors in Skype, turning a $2 million investment into a $200 million gain, according to the firm. It was also an early backer of Israeli-based Wix.com, which helps small businesses manage websites. Mangrove’s initial $8 million investment in Wix.com was worth $550 million after its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2013, Mangrove said. Mangrove remains Wix.com’s biggest shareholder and Tluszcz serves as the company’s chairman.








"Our early success with Skype created a culture of risk-taking in the firm," he said, adding that it has given Mangrove the confidence to encourage entrepreneurs not to sell out too early. He says that in the past, a lack of ambition and pressure from less aggressive venture capital firms has often resulted in European technology founders selling their companies too soon. He says this is one reason Europe has not produced a company to rival U.S. technology giants such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc., he said.Mangrove now manages more than $1 billion. With an investment team of 12 with offices in Berlin and Tel Aviv in addition to Luxembourg, the investor has backed a total of 130 start ups.

Tluszcz is known for his sometimes controversial stances. He has been an outspoken critic of many so-called "unicorns" -- private companies valued at more than $1 billion -- saying that these companies were "fake unicorns," having inflated their valuations with financial engineering and accounting gimmicks. Last year, he also warned of a dangerous bubble among financial technology startups, saying that many of these companies would not result in big pay days for investors.While a number of European venture capital firms have been increasing the size of the funds they raise and have begun putting money into later stage companies, Tluszcz said that Mangrove purposefully chose to keep its overall fund size relatively small.He said this enabled the firm to stay focused on early-stage investments -- where most funding rounds are less than $10 million -- while still reserving enough money in the fund to enable it to build up a significant stake in successful businesses throughout their growth.




Staying relatively small also allows the fund to potentially rack up bigger percentage gains from its most successful investments. "Rather than becoming a larger fund, we have opted to stay small to maximize the performance of our fund," he said, adding that studies have shown that larger funds tend to result in diminishing returns. "We don’t want to change a recipe that works very well for us."Mangrove raised the new fund in two months, Tluszcz said, with 90 percent of money coming from investors that had backed previous funds. While he declined to name these investors citing confidentiality agreements, Tluszcz said that they included about 20 pension funds and high-net worth individuals, half of which are located in the U.S., 40 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Asia.
