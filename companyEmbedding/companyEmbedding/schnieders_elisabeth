      ■ Richard J. Schnieders spent his career in the food-service
      industry, eventually becoming the chairman and chief executive officer for
      SYSCO Corporation, the largest distributor and marketer of food-service
      products and services in North America. After he graduated from the
      University of Iowa in 1970, he worked in management with several companies
      in the food-service industry before he was hired in 1982 by
      Hardin's Sysco of Memphis, Tennessee, a subsidiary of SYSCO. He
      worked at the Memphis facility for 10 years, including four as chairman,
      chief executive officer, and president. The company moved him to its
      headquarters in Houston, Texas, in 1992 as a senior vice president. He
      assumed the position of president and chief operating officer in 2000, and
      three years later he became the company's chairman and CEO.
      Schnieders, like his predecessors, promised that the company would
      continue to be ambitious in its pursuit of growth.
    

      HIRED AT SYSCO IN MEMPHIS
    

      Schnieders was born in Remsen, Iowa, in 1948 and grew up in Iowa. He
      graduated from the University of Iowa with a bachelor of arts degree in
      mathematics in 1970. For the next 12 years he served in various management
      capacities for other companies within the food industry. He caught the
      attention of Charles H. Cotros, who wanted to hire Schnieders at
      Hardin's Sysco, SYSCO's operation in Memphis, Tennessee.
      Though the Memphis subsidiary did not have an opening at the time, Cotros
      decided to create the position of vice president of business development,
      hiring Schnieders in 1982. Schnieders "was on his own from
      there," Cotros told the 
      
        Houston Chronicle
      
       (March 19, 2002).
    

      After starting in SYSCO's executive development program in Memphis,
      Schnieders moved on to positions as director of supplies and equipment,
      vice president of merchandising services, and executive vice president.
      During Schnieders's tenure at Hardin's Sysco, its parent
      company continued to grow at a steady pace. By 1988 SYSCO was the largest
      food-service distributor in North America, and it continued to grow. In
      1988 the company acquired one if its competitors, CFS Continental, adding
      a large truck fleet and significantly increasing the geographic scope of
      its business.
    

      Schnieders's rise to the top of the ladder at the Memphis facility
      became complete when he was promoted to president and chief executive
      officer of the local branch of the company. He was later named chairman.
      He ran the Hardin's Sysco operation for four years.
    

      MOVING TO SYSCO'S CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
    

      In 1992 SYSCO moved Schnieders to its company headquarters in Houston,
      appointing him to the position of senior vice president of merchandising
      services. After he had spent five years in that position, his
      responsibilities increased to include oversight of multiunit sales. In
      1997 he was elected to SYSCO's board of directors. During the
      following year, he continued his rise through the company when SYSCO
      announced his appointment as executive vice president for food-service
      operations. In this position he was responsible for overseeing five senior
      vice presidents of operations, who were each responsible for about
      one-sixth of the SYSCO operating companies in the United States and
      Canada. He assumed this position on January 1, 1999.
    

      SYSCO's growth continued through the 1990s, and the company made a
      number of significant acquisitions in 1999. Annual sales continued to
      increase, jumping from $15 billion in 1998 to $22.6 billion in 2001. In
      1999 the company announced that Cotros would replace Bill Lindig as
      SYSCO's chief executive officer in 2000. SYSCO selected Schnieders
      to replace Cotros as the company's president and chief operating
      officer.
    

      CONTINUING SYSCO'S SUCCESS AS PRESIDENT AND CEO
    

      By 2000 SYSCO was providing services and products to approximately 400,000
      customers, including restaurants, health-care and educational
      institutions, and other operations in food services. During
      Schnieders's tenure as the company's president and COO, the
      economy of the United States suffered a significant downturn. Schnieders
      recognized that the growth of his company, as well as the food-service
      industry in general, related to the "ability of several other
      industries to prosper" (Business Wire, May 16, 2002). Nevertheless,
      SYSCO continued its steady growth. During fiscal year 2002 the company
      experienced five record-breaking sales weeks, including sales of more than
      $500 million during the week preceding Mother's Day, representing
      the first time that the company's sales had surpassed a
      half-billion dollars in a single week.
    

      Cotros, who worked in the food-service industry for more than 30 years,
      announced his retirement in March 2002. The company selected Schnieders to
      succeed Cotros as the company's chairman and chief executive
      officer, the fifth in the company's history. Like Cotros,
      Schnieders promised that the company would continue to be ambitious
      regarding its growth. "The industry we serve is now approaching
      $200 billion annually and I am bullish on the future of our
      industry," Schnieders said in a company press release. "I am
      equally excited about the opportunities that [lie] ahead for SYSCO"
      (March 18, 2002).
    

      Analysts said that Schnieders had reason for optimism. SYSCO's plan
      for success involved a series of acquisitions as well as continued
      expansion of its products and services. Industry insiders marveled at
      SYSCO's achievements in the marketplace, with one executive
      commenting to the 
      
        New York Times
      
       that SYSCO "is one of the great uninterrupted growth stories in
      American business" (April 27, 2003).
    

      Schnieders said he would stay the course in leading the company.
      "We will continue to operate with the same direction and same
      strategy as we have in the past," he said in an article in 
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
       in April 2003. "Our biggest opportunity is to sell more to our
      existing customers and find new, good customers. We also want to identify
      good acquisition candidates that match up well to our business"
      (April 14, 2003). Schnieders surprised some industry analysts in 2003 by
      claiming that the company could double its revenues by 2008.
    

      In addition to his position with SYSCO, Schnieders served on the boards of
      Aviall and the NRA Education Foundation.
