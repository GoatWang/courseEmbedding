San Juan Asset Management is an SEC registered investment advisor based in San Juan. The firm was begun in 2005 by Jose A. Vizcarrondo as the investment management arm of a highly successful family office responsible for managing family generational wealth more than a century old. San Juan Asset Management’s investment professionals offer years of successful global investing experience in emerging and developed markets. The firm is committed to achieving attractive risk adjusted returns through its investment strategy that combines top-down (macro) and bottom-up (fundamental) approaches to investing in equities in developed and emerging markets worldwide. The investment team takes a dynamic approach of investing across countries, strategies, and companies to take advantage of global macroeconomic trends as their effects become widely manifested. San Juan Asset Management offers global long/short and long only investment strategies on a separate account basis or through its Global Opportunities Capital Appreciation Fund.









San Juan Asset Management was founded in 2005 as a San Juan, Puerto Rico domiciled investment advisor focusing on emerging and developed markets. The firm employs a team of two senior investment professionals and support staff operating out of offices in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the firm is based. San Juan Asset Management was started by Jose A. Vizcarrondo who together with Fernando Padro have a long and distinguished track record in international investment management, research, and analysis.

                          San Juan Asset Management’s edge is its ability to leverage the international investment experience and global multi-asset class insights of its investment professionals.  The result: a broader view of potential investment opportunities and deeper level of expertise, allowing for strong theme/idea generation that translates into superior returns for San Juan Asset Management investors.

                          Collaboration is integral to interdisciplinary communication, firm-wide risk management and the discovery of new opportunities.  Underpinning the spirit of collaboration across our organization is an incentive model for all San Juan Asset Management employees based on overall firm performance.  The managerial encouragement and financial incentives to share and implement promising ideas overwhelm tendencies to silo information. 

                          A disciplined risk control process, refined with years of practical experience, is an integral part of the firm's investment process and the resulting attractive risk-adjusted return profiles of our fund products.  For certain qualified investors we also offer separate accounts. 

                          Our clients include banks,  institutional investors, accredited individual investors and public pension funds.  Since its inception, San Juan Asset Management has been a Registered Investment Adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Our office is authorized and regulated by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico. 

 As of December 2012, assets under management totaled US$130 million.
