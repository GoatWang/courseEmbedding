                          Zero-Sort Recycling
                      





































Zero-Sort® recycling: No sorting of recyclable material on your end makes recycling quick and easy. Just focus on filling the bin and we take care of the rest. Our Zero-Sort facilities handle many types of recyclables including cardboard, paper, plastic, metal and glass that is baled, remarketed and transformed into new products.

Continuous Improvement: A Focus on Quality
Our goal with recycling is to produce high-quality materials that manufacturers actively seek out for their products. We take pride in the quality of our recycled material, and to protect it, we are willing to invest considerable time and energy. This is an essential component of building a thriving recycling industry.
One challenge that all recycling facility operators face is the presence of residue, or non-recyclable materials, mixed in with the inbound recyclables. Residue can diminish the quality of the recycling stream, impede sorting processes, increase operating costs, and potentially damage processing equipment or put facility employees at risk. Residue occurs when generators don't know what belongs in their recycling bin or don't appreciate the importance of proper sorting. Do your part to recycle correctly. Download a recycling brochure below to learn more about what can and can't go into your recycling bin.

We therefore have a strong environmental and financial incentive to reduce our dependency on diesel by running a more efficient vehicle fleet. Our improvements over recent years have included the modernization of our fleet as well as using alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and biodiesel in select markets.
Across the company, we continue to modernize our fleet by retiring older vehicles and replacing them with newer, more efficient vehicles. These improvements will increase our overall operating efficiency, reduce our emissions, and provide our operators with better tools to do their work.
We also run a portion of our fleet on compressed natural gas (CNG), which has a lower carbon footprint, emits less air pollution, and runs more quietly than diesel. Today, we are running 35 CNG-fueled trash and recycling vehicles from our hauling operations in Burlington, VT; Fort Edward, NY; Geneva, NY; and Horseheads, NY. These fleets have enabled us to replace nearly 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel with CNG.
In Portland, ME, our customers help fuel our trucks. Here's how it works: several of our restaurant customers in Portland set aside their used vegetable oil for recycling. Maine Standard Biofuels pays them for the oil, which they collect and refine into biodiesel. We then buy and blend the fuel into our tanks to replace a portion of our diesel usage. Our Portland fleet runs on 20% biodiesel, and saved about 30,000 gallons of regular diesel last year.
In addition to these measures, we are conducting demonstration tests to evaluate the cutting edge new technologies of the future. One such demonstration will be a hydraulic hybrid launch truck, which is estimated to consume 44% less diesel than current 2010 diesel technology. Another demonstration project will assess a fuel saving technology that manages engine power to optimize fuel efficiency and performance, with fuel economy benefits of up to 10%.

                          History
                      






































Casella Waste Systems, Inc. and its predecessor companies were founded in 1975 as Casella's Refuse Removal in Rutland, Vermont. On a chilly day in early April, Doug Casella began picking up garbage from a few customers in the Rutland and Killington region with a pickup truck he had bought with money saved from jobs he’d had as a kid in high school. Because the service was good, the small enterprise grew, and John Casella joined his younger brother a year later to help run the business.
The brothers, influenced not only by that unique spirit of New England frugality, could also see the future – and in 1977 built the company's first, and the state's first, recycling facility in Vermont. It was an inspired vision, one that anticipated the opportunities around resource renewal as well as viewing waste management as an integrated set of services – collection, recycling, transfer, and disposal.
The belief in this approach, and changes in public policy, fueled a period of rapid growth, as the company built an unparalleled waste and resource management infrastructure throughout the northeastern U.S.
In 1997, the company undertook an initial public offering of its stock. Trading of Casella stock began the day after one of the largest collapses in U.S. stock market history, and, despite general investor jitters about the market as a whole, the company's IPO became one of the most successful in industry history. The company is now publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “CWST.”
Since 2000, the company has moved more aggressively to supplement traditional waste management services with its expertise in resource renewal and sustainability. It has consistently led the industry in offering services and infrastructure that help communities and customers sustain – economically as well as environmentally – the planet’s limited resources.
Today, with a clear strategy to serve our customers with integrated services, we continue to lead the solid waste industry with an innovative business strategy that seeks to create sustainable value beyond the traditional waste disposal model. We view waste as a resource for producing renewable energy and as a raw material for manufacturing new products.
And, just like our early days, we believe that if the service is good, the enterprise will thrive.

                          Recycling
                      





















































Recycling provides a perfect example of the teamwork involved in successful resource management. Households and businesses do their part to separate recyclable materials from their trash, and we do our part to collect, sort, and process them into high-quality raw materials for manufacturers to use in new products. Recycling works best when we all play our parts well.

We live in a closed-loop environment. Everything is connected. An innovative approach to managing today’s waste includes the realization that renewing the life-cycle of the products we consume is a critical step in reducing waste. The concept of managing solid waste means giving trash new purpose and a new life. It’s about turning waste into a resource.
From our first recycling center in Vermont in 1977, to our current infrastructure of seven recycling facilities, Casella has pioneered the recycling processing field. Today, Casella is leading the industry with investments in recycling infrastructure, research and development driving the next generation of recycling technologies, and innovative recycling programs that are making recycling easier for our customers.

Brokerage Services
Are you managing a distribution center, municipality or retail location that bales its own commodities such as cardboard, paper or plastic? If so, consider using our brokerage service to manage your recycling service needs. Casella manages nearly 800,000 tons of recyclables each year, making us the largest recycler in the Northeast.  Leveraging our vast network of recycling buyers and end-sites to which we market material, Casella is the premier partner to broker small or large quantities of material directly to our proprietary network of mills. Please call us at 888-499-7720 to learn more.
















Industrial/Specialty Recycling 
Whether you are a manufacturer, institution, municipality or other commercial generator, you likely generate difficult to manage or non-traditional recyclables not acceptable in Zero-Sort Recycling programs.  Casella partners with our customers to determine viable solutions – economic and environmental – to managing these streams.  Coupled with our ability to manage recycling solutions for non-salable consumer products, Casella can work with your location to find effective solutions for your streams – whether the material is loose in gaylords, palletized, baled, or packaged. 
We collect, separate and process over 100 commodities on behalf of our customers, packaged and delivered in myriad forms and consistencies.  Some of the more common streams we deal with are the following:

- Scrap metals, ferrous and non-ferrous
- PP, PS, HDPE, LDPE, PET, Nylon, Cotton
- Kraft bags, butt rolls, cores  
- Reels, hosing, films

















Managing Non-Salable Consumer Goods 
A resource solution to maximize material recovery and specialty processing or disposal of off-spec, expired or otherwise non-salable consumer goods. Casella provides depackaging and disposal services for a wide range of manufactured consumer products. We work with a proprietary network of facilities and logistics partners across the country to offer this service to customers as part of our comprehensive resource solutions.
Casella will arrange and manage all freight and logistics, identify and qualify outlets for disposal or recovery, generate certificates of destruction and comply with all local, state or federal regulations and requirements.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
