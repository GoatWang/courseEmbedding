As a percentage of RMR's recent stock price of $34.00, this dividend works out to approximately 0.74%, so look for shares of The Rmr Group Class A to trade 0.74% lower — all else being equal — when RMR shares open for trading on 7/20/16.

Reit Management & Research Inc. Changes Name To "The RMR Group Inc." And Announces Filing Of Initial Registration Statement For Proposed Distribution






Business Wire




Oct 15, 2015 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Reit Management & Research Inc. today announced that it has changed its name to "The RMR Group Inc."  The company also announced that it has filed an initial Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in connection with the proposed distribution of shares of its class A common stock by each of Government Properties Income Trust (NYSE: GOV), Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE: HPT), Select Income REIT (NYSE: SIR) and Senior Housing Properties Trust (NYSE: SNH). The RMR Group Inc. plans to apply to list its shares on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ, under the ticker "RMR" upon the registration statement being declared effective by the SEC. The proposed distribution is expected to occur after the registration statement is declared effective.  The RMR Group primarily provides management services to publicly owned real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and real estate operating companies. The RMR Group is headquartered in Newton, MA.  This press release refers to a distribution of shares of The RMR Group Inc. that GOV, HPT, SIR and SNH propose to make. A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC, but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. The distribution will be made only by means of a prospectus after the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC. A copy of the prospectus related to the distribution may be obtained, when available, from: Investor Relations, The RMR Group at ir@rmrgroup.com or by calling 617-796-8230. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that state or jurisdiction.  WARNING REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS PRESS RELEASE INCLUDES FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. ALSO, WHENEVER WE USE WORDS SUCH AS BELIEVE, EXPECT, INTEND, ANTICIPATE OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CURRENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND THEY MAY NOT OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING SOME REASONS WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE:   THIS PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT THE RMR GROUP INC. HAS FILED A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ITS SHARES AND THAT SHARES OF THE RMR GROUP INC. ARE EXPECTED TO BE LISTED ON THE NASDAQ. THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE SEC STAFF, WHICH MAY ALSO TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME. THE LISTING OF THE SHARES ON THE NASDAQ IS SUBJECT TO THE RMR GROUP INC.'S SATISFACTION OF THE LISTING REQUIREMENTS AND APPROVAL OF THE NASDAQ. THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE WHEN OR IF THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT WILL BE DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC, THAT THE SHARES WILL BE APPROVED FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ OR WHEN OR IF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RMR GROUP INC. SHARES WILL OCCUR.   THE DISTRIBUTION IS SUBJECT TO AUTHORIZATION BY EACH OF GOV, HPT, SIR AND SNH. WHILE GOV, HPT, SIR AND SNH HAVE EACH AGREED TO MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION, THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE WHEN OR IF IT WILL BE MADE.

The RMR Group Inc. (Nasdaq: RMR) today announced its financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.Adam Portnoy, President and Chief Executive Officer, made the following statement regarding the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results: “Total revenues grew 17.0% on a quarterly basis and 38.4% on an annual basis compared to last year, which contributed to continued increases in net income and Adjusted EBITDA. Net income was $18.8 million, or $0.46 per share, for the fourth quarter, a 15.0% increase compared to last year, and Adjusted EBITDA was $27.4 million for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we also closed the acquisition of Tremont Realty Capital, and we expect this business may provide RMR a platform for growth in the commercial real estate finance industry. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents having grown over the past year to $65.8 million and no indebtedness at September 30, 2016. We believe this makes us well positioned to take advantage of possible future growth opportunities."Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Highlights:•As of September 30, 2016, The RMR Group Inc. had approximately $26.9 billion of total assets under management for all client companies.

rmr_10k_2016-12-15_55_87Financial - ExpenseGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $1,406 primarily due to $5,454 of transaction related costs associated with the Up-C Transaction in fiscal year 2015, compared to $1,966 of transaction and acquisition related costs in fiscal year 2016.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_56_90Financial - ExpenseDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $349 primarily as a result of certain equipment and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated subsequent to October 1, 2015, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets related to our 2016 Tremont business acquisition.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_82_124Financial - IncomeInterest and other income increased $1,235 primarily due to increased dividends received from the Managed REITs and EQC on common shares of the Managed REITs and EQC we owned, as well as interest on a larger amount of investable cash we had during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_85_132Financial - Shares / EquityEquity in earnings of investee represents our proportionate share of earnings from our investment in AIC for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and the change represents the decrease in AICs profits in fiscal year 2015 compared to 2014.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_49_249Revenue - ProductManagement services revenue increased $64,334 primarily due to a $62,263 annual incentive business management fee earned on December 31, 2015, an increase of $7,829 in base business management fees at the Managed REITs
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_97_264Financial - Cash FlowOur changes in cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to the comparable prior year period were as follows: i cash provided from operating activities decreased from $102,080 in fiscal year 2015 to $98,824 in
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_53_79Financial - ExpenseCompensation and benefits consist of employee salaries and other employment related costs, including health insurance expenses, contributions related to our employee retirement plan, and in fiscal 2016, the value of vested shares granted to certain of our employees under our 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_99_166Financial - IncomeThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects increased operating income generated in fiscal year 2016 primarily offset by the net effect of changes in our working capital activities between the two periods, including the collection of accounts receivable from EQC during the fiscal year 2015 period and the payment of amounts due to related parties during the fiscal year 2016.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_52_77Revenue - ProductThese fees increased by $240, primarily due to $250 of revenue earned by the Tremont business subsequent to our August 2016 acquisition.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_51_74Financial - ExpenseReimbursable payroll and related costs revenue increased $9,430 due primarily to increases in value of share grants to some of our employees by certain of our Client Companies, increases in the number of properties we manage for the Managed REITs since October 1, 2014, and the related increase in the number of employees since that date and their associated compensation and benefits as well as regular increases in employee compensation and benefits for which we receive reimbursement.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_102_171Other - OtherThe increase in cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflects changes in our working capital accounts in fiscal year 2015, including the collection of accounts receivable from an unrelated party i.e., from EQC, which ceased to be a related party to us after it experienced a change of control in March 2014.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_23_233Financial - ExpenseIncludes business management fees and property management fees, including construction supervision fees, if any, earned during the applicable period and excludes reimbursable payroll and related costs.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_77_113Financial - ExpenseCompensation and benefits expense decreased $44,385 primarily due to a decrease in the number of property management personnel after our property management services to EQC ended on September 30, 2014 and a decrease in the value of certain shares granted to our employees by certain of our Client Companies and EQC, partially offset by the accelerated vesting of certain EQC share grants in March 2014.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_108_183Financial - Shares / EquityWe believe our cash and short term investments are not subject to any material interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk or other market risk.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_91_147Financial - ExpenseWe expect that our future working capital needs will relate largely to our operating expenses, primarily consisting of employee compensation and benefits costs, our obligation to make quarterly tax distributions to the members of RMR LLC, our obligation to make payments to ABP Trust under the Tax Receivable Agreement, our plan to make quarterly distributions on our Class A Common Shares and Class B-1 Common Shares and our plan to pay quarterly distributions to the members of RMR LLC in connection with the quarterly dividend to RMR Inc. shareholders.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_58_94Financial - Shares / EquityUnrealized losses attributable to changes in fair value of stock accounted for under the fair value option in fiscal year 2015 consists of net unrealized losses on the common shares of the Managed REITs we owned before the Up-C Transaction based on changes in quoted market prices between the beginning and end of the applicable period.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_90_144Other - OtherThe increase in cash and cash equivalents principally reflects cash generated from operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including RMR LLCs portion of the calendar year 2015 incentive business management fee that it received in January 2016.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_13_13Financial - ExpenseBase business management fees payable to us by the Managed REITs are calculated monthly based upon the lesser of the average historical cost of each Managed REITs assets under management or its average total market capitalization, as calculated in accordance with the applicable business management agreement, for each month.
rmr_10k_2016-12-15_113_199Other - OtherWe consider them to be critical because of their significance to our financial statements and the possibility that future events may cause differences from current judgments or because the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
