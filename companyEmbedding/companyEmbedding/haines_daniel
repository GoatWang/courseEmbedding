              Abstract




9410189 Haines The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and graduate student engineers to provide prototype "custom designed" devices and software to aid persons with disabilities. The primary goal of this thrust is to provide meaningful design experience for the engineering student that will directly aid a specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at Manhattan College which will ensure satisfactory progress is attained on these projects. A group of students and the investigators on the grant will work with a number of collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects. Forty projects are planned during the three year duration of this award, and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual publication. Once completed, each project will be given to the person for whom it is designed. The hope is that this "real world" experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and raise student interest in graduate education. This type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation devices. ***

Rivers Divided
Indus Basin Waters in the Making of India and Pakistan
Daniel Haines


Daniel Haines uncovers the history of one of the most important factors in relations between these two South Asian powers -- water
A new approach that contextualizes the Indus conflict in terms of decolonization and Cold War policies
Emphasizes how critical the Indus Basin river system is to both India and Pakistan and how the treaty failed to resolve all conflict








Rivers Divided
Indus Basin Waters in the Making of India and Pakistan
Daniel Haines



Description



The Indus Waters Treaty is considered a key example of India-Pakistan cooperation, but less has been said about its critical influence on state-making in both countries. Rivers Divided reveals the importance of the Indus Basin river system, and thus control over it, for Indian and Pakistani claims to sovereignty after South Asia's Partition in 1947. Securing water flows was a key aim for both governments. In 1960 the Indus Waters Treaty ostensibly settled the dispute, but in fact failed to address critical sources of tension. Examples include the role of water in the Kashmir conflict and the riverine geography of Punjab's militarised border zone. Despite the recent resurgence of disputes over water-sharing in South Asia, the historical causes and consequences of the region's flagship natural resources treaty remain little understood. Based on new research in South Asia, the United States and United Kingdom, this book places the Indus dispute, for the first time, in the context of decolonisation and Cold War-era development politics. It examines the discord at local, national and international levels, arguing that we can only explain its importance and longevity in light of India and Pakistan's state-building initiatives after independence.

Rivers Divided
Indus Basin Waters in the Making of India and Pakistan
Daniel Haines


Reviews and Awards


"Competition for water in the Indus Valley has been a major example of competition for this key resource in the modern world. In this outstanding book, Haines demonstrates the local, national and international forces at work in producing the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. It is a major contribution to the history of both decolonisation and the environment." -- Francis Robinson, Professor of the History of South Asia, Royal Holloway, University of London
"Rivers Divided deftly takes a history of rivers into the realms of state-building, sovereignty negotiation and national identity. Sensitive to the distinctive post-colonial and Cold War contexts, Haines' unique contribution lies in addressing longer-term processes, not iconic events, intensively exploiting newly available archives in India, Pakistan, the U.K. and U.S." -- Philip Brown, Professor of History, Ohio State University

Daniel Edward “Nick” Knowlton



Born in Lewiston, July 16, 1951, he was the son of Carmella and Clinton Knowlton. He attended Lewiston High School. Daniel was widowed in 2007 with his wife, Joye, passing at the age of 52. Together they had two children, Krista and Nicholas, both of Lewiston.
Daniel “Nick” was a well-known entertainer throughout Maine and much of New England. His musical career started in the early '60s with his first band, Terry & the Telstars. He performed in several bands through the years, including Katahdin, Katfish, Good n’ Plenty, Eye 2 Eye, Next Exit, Speed Limit, U.S. Pure and Phoenix, to name a few. In 1975, he had a Billboard top 100 hit with his remake of The Beatles’ “Dear Prudence” with the band Katfish. Nick’s career included traveling the country to open for major acts such as Jimi Hendrix, Cheap Trick, The Cars, The Marshall Tucker Band and several more. He went on to deejay hundreds of weddings over the past several years and was dubbed “The Original Wedding Singer.” Among his proudest moments was his ability to coordinate the PAL Hop Reunion in 2010, an event that drew thousands to see rock bands from the Lewiston-Auburn area from the '50s, '60s and '70s, hosted at the Colisee. He is well-known for his voice on many radio jingles, including Marden’s, Sam’s, VIP Auto, Gipper’s Sports Grill, Lost Valley, Northern Mattress & Furniture, Delekto Bros. and Lewiston Maineiacs. He also wrote and sang the jingles for Champoux Insurance and Community Credit Union.
He was also recognized for his volunteerism in the Lewiston-Auburn community. He was a key member of boards and campaigns for many local organizations, including the Liberty Festival, Great Falls Balloon Festival, March of Dimes, Friends of Pettingill and United Way. He was instrumental in creating the U Booze U Looze campaign against underage drinking. He was also part of the 2007 All-America City Campaign for the city of Lewiston. He often volunteered his musical services to several festivals, parades and memorial services throughout Lewiston-Auburn. During his illness, the city of Lewiston proclaimed March 12 “Nick Knowlton Day” in the city, an honor he was very humbled by.
Among his likes and passions, he enjoyed golfing with his best friend, Doug Haines, and camping with his family. Daniel was most proud of his family, including his two children and five grandchildren.
In 2012, Daniel moved to Largo, Fla., to continue entertaining with his musical talents year-round. He entertained thousands of vacation goers and residents. While in Largo, Daniel found love again with Robin “Mollie” Grondin. They together shared a love of music and entertainment and had future plans. Mollie was the primary caregiver for Daniel during his illness and was at his side around the clock with unwavering love and support.
Daniel is survived by his daughter, Krista, her love, Zachary Pomelow, and her three children, Madison, Zakary and Ava; his son, Nicholas, wife, Brie, and their children, Evan and Natalee; his sisters, Elaine Poulin and Diane Knowlton; brothers, Clint and Steve Knowlton; his girlfriend, Robin “Mollie” Grondin; and many cousins, nieces, nephews and extended family.
Daniel was predeceased by his mother, Carmella; his father, Clinton; and his wife, Joye.
