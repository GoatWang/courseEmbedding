FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

THE FUNDS AT A GLANCE                                                           
MANAGEMENT: Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (FMR) is the             
management arm of Fidelity Investments, which was established in 1946 and       
is now America's largest mutual fund manager. FMR Texas Inc. (FTX), a           
subsidiary of FMR, chooses investments for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money      
Market.                                                                         
As with any mutual fund, there is no assurance that a fund will achieve its     
goal.                                                                           
SPARTAN ARIZONA MONEY                                                           
GOAL: High current tax-free income for Arizona residents while maintaining      
a stable share price.                                                           
STRATEGY: Invests in high-quality, short-term securities whose interest is      
free from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax.                   
SPARTAN ARIZONA INCOME                                                          
GOAL: High current tax-free income for Arizona residents.                       
STRATEGY: Invests mainly in long-term, investment-grade securities whose        
interest is free from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax.       
WHO MAY WANT TO INVEST                                                          
These non-diversified funds may be appropriate for investors in higher tax      
brackets who seek high current income that is free from federal income tax      
and Arizona personal income tax. Each fund's level of risk, and potential       
reward, depends on the quality and maturity of its investments. Spartan         
Arizona Municipal Money Market is managed to keep its share price stable at     
$1.00. Spartan Arizona Municipal Income, with its broader range of              
investments, has the potential for higher yields, but also carries a higher     
degree of risk.                                                                 
By themselves, these funds do not constitute a balanced investment plan.        
The value of the funds' investments and the income they generate will vary      
from day to day, generally reflecting changes in interest rates, market         
conditions, and other federal and state political and economic news. When       
you sell shares of Spartan Arizona Municipal Income, they may be worth more     
or less than what you paid for them.                                            
The Spartan family of funds is designed for cost-conscious investors            
looking for higher yields through lower costs. The Spartan                      
Approach(Registered trademark) requires investors to make high minimum          
investments and, in some cases, to pay for individual transactions.

ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES are paid out of each fund's assets. Each         
fund pays a management fee to FMR. Expenses are factored into each fund's       
share price or dividends and are not charged directly to shareholder            
accounts (see page ).

EXAMPLES: Let's say, hypothetically, that each fund's annual return is 5%       
and that its operating expenses are exactly as just described. For every        
$1,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses after      
the number of years indicated, first assuming that you leave your account       
open, and then assuming that you close your account at the end of the           
period:

These examples illustrate the effect of expenses, but are not meant to          
suggest actual or expected costs or returns, all of which may vary.             
FMR has voluntarily agreed to temporarily limit Spartan Arizona Municipal       
Money Market's operating expenses to .00% of its average net assets, and        
Spartan Arizona Municipal Income's operating expenses to .00% of its            
average net assets. If this agreement were not in effect, the management        
fee, other expenses, and total operating expenses would be .50%, .00%, and      
.50%, respectively, for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market, and .55%,       
.00%, and .55%, respectively, for Spartan Arizona Municipal Income.             
Expenses eligible for reimbursement do not include interest, taxes,             
brokerage commissions, or extraordinary expenses.

This section would normally show how each fund has performed over time.         
Because the funds were new when this prospectus was printed, their              
performance is not included. Twice a year, you will receive a report            
detailing each fund's recent strategies, performance, and holdings. For         
current performance or a free annual report, call 1-800-544-8888.               
EXPLANATION OF TERMS                                                            
TOTAL RETURN is the change in value of an investment in a fund over a given     
period, assuming reinvestment of any dividends and capital gains. A             
CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN reflects actual performance over a stated period of     
time. An AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN is a hypothetical rate of return that,     
if achieved annually, would have produced the same cumulative total return      
if performance had been constant over the entire period. Average annual         
total returns smooth out variations in performance; they are not the same       
as actual year-by-year results. Average annual total returns covering           
periods of less than one year assume that performance will remain constant      
for the rest of the year.                                                       
YIELD refers to the income generated by an investment in a fund over a          
given period of time, expressed as an annual percentage rate. When a money      
market fund yield assumes that income earned is reinvested, it is called an     
EFFECTIVE YIELD. A TAX-EQUIVALENT YIELD shows what an investor would have       
to earn before taxes to equal a tax-free yield. Yields for the bond fund        
are calculated according to a standard that is required for all stock and       
bond funds. Because this differs from other accounting methods, the quoted      
yield may not equal the income actually paid to shareholders.                   

UNDERSTANDING

YIELD illustrates the income

EACH FUND IS A MUTUAL FUND: an investment that pools shareholders' money        
and invests it toward a specified goal. In technical terms, Spartan Arizona     
Municipal Money Market is currently a non-diversified fund of Fidelity          
Union Street Trust II, and Spartan Arizona Municipal Income is currently a      
non-diversified fund of Fidelity Union Street Trust. Both trusts are            
open-end management investment companies. Fidelity Union Street Trust II        
was organized as a Delaware business trust on June 20, 1991. Fidelity Union     
Street Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on March 1,        
1974. There is a remote possibility that one fund might become liable for a

EACH FUND IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES, which is responsible for          
protecting the interests of shareholders. The trustees are experienced          
executives who meet throughout the year to oversee the funds' activities,       
review contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the     
funds, and review performance. The majority of trustees are not otherwise       
affiliated with Fidelity.                                                       
THE FUNDS MAY HOLD SPECIAL MEETINGS AND MAIL PROXY MATERIALS. These             
meetings may be called to elect or remove trustees, change fundamental          
policies, approve a management contract, or for other purposes.                 
Shareholders not attending these meetings are encouraged to vote by proxy.      
Fidelity will mail proxy materials in advance, including a voting card and      
information about the proposals to be voted on. For Spartan Arizona             
Municipal Money, you are entitled to one vote for each share you own. For       
Spartan Arizona Municipal Income, the number of votes you are entitled to       
is based upon the dollar value of your investment.

The funds are managed by FMR, which chooses their investments and handles       
their business affairs. FTX has primary responsibility for providing            
investment management services for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market.      
Anne Punzak is manager of Spartan Arizona Income, which she has managed         
since September 1994. Ms. Punzak also manages Aggressive Tax-Free,  High        
Yield Tax-Free, Spartan Aggressive Municipal Income and Spartan Florida         
Municipal Income. She joined Fidelity in 1984.                                  
Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) distributes and markets Fidelity's      
funds and services. Fidelity Service Co. (FSC) performs transfer agent          
servicing functions for the funds.                                              
FMR Corp. is the parent company of these organizations. Through ownership       
of voting common stock, Edward C. Johnson 3d (President and a trustee of        
the trusts), Johnson family members, and various trusts for the benefit of      
the Johnson family form a controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.           
United Missouri Bank, N.A., is each fund's transfer agent, although it          
employs FSC to perform these functions for the funds. It is located at 1010     
Grand Avenue, Kansas City, Missouri.                                            
To carry out the funds' transactions, FMR may use its broker-dealer             
affiliates and other firms that sell fund shares, provided that a fund          
receives services and commission rates comparable to those of other             
broker-dealers.                                                                 
INVESTMENT PRINCIPLES AND RISKS                                                 
SPARTAN ARIZONA MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET seeks high current income that is        
free from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax while              
maintaining a stable $1.00 share price by investing in high-quality,            
short-term municipal securities of all types. As a result, when you sell        
your shares, they should be worth the same amount as when you bought them.      
Of course, there is no guarantee that the fund will maintain a stable $1.00     
share price. FMR normally invests at least 65% of the fund's total assets       
in state tax-free securities, and normally invest at least 80% of the           
fund's assets in municipal securities whose interest is free from federal       
income tax.                                                                     
The fund follows industry-standard guidelines on the quality and maturity       
of its investments, which are designed to help maintain a stable $1.00          
share price. The fund will purchase only high-quality securities that FMR       
believes present minimal credit risks and will observe maturity                 
restrictions on securities it buys. It is possible that a major change in       
interest rates or a default on the fund's investments could cause its share     
price (and the value of your investment) to change.                             
SPARTAN ARIZONA MUNICIPAL INCOME seeks high current income that is free         
from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax by investing            
primarily in municipal securities judged by FMR to be of investment-grade       
quality, although it can invest in some lower-quality securities. The fund      
has no restrictions on maturity, but it generally invests in long-term          
bonds and maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 15 years or           
longer. FMR normally invests at least 65% of the fund's total assets in         
state tax-free securities, and normally invests at least 80% of the fund's      
assets in municipal securities whose interest is free from federal income       
tax.                                                                            
EACH FUND'S yield and the bond fund's share price change daily based on         
changes in interest rates, market conditions, other political and economic      
news, and on the quality and maturity of its investments. In general, bond      
prices rise when interest rates fall, and vice versa. This effect is            
usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Lower-quality               
securities offer higher yields, but also carry more risk.                       
Each fund's performance is closely tied to the economic and political           
conditions within the state of Arizona. The rate of growth in Arizona           
slowed in the late '80s and early '90s, and assessed valuations in many         
areas have declined, putting pressure on state and local budgets. However,      
the state's growth in population and employment and other economic              
indicators continues to outpace that of the nation as a whole. Economic         
conditions within the state are expected to reflect moderate growth through     
1994.                                                                           
If you are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax, you should note      
that each fund may invest all of its assets in municipal securities issued      
to finance private activities. The interest from these investments is a         
tax-preference item for purposes of the tax.                                    
FMR normally invests each fund's assets according to its investment             
strategy. The funds do not expect to invest in federally taxable                
obligations, and Spartan Arizona Municipal Income does not expect to invest     
in state taxable obligations. Each fund also reserves the right to invest       
without limitation in short-term instruments, to hold a substantial amount      
of uninvested cash, or to invest more than normally permitted in taxable        
obligations for temporary, defensive purposes.                                  
SECURITIES AND INVESTMENT PRACTICES                                             
The following pages contain more detailed information about types of            
instruments in which a fund may invest, and strategies FMR may employ in        
pursuit of a fund's investment objective. A summary of risks and                
restrictions associated with these instrument types and investment              
practices is included as well. Policies and limitations are considered at       
the time of purchase; the sale of instruments is not required in the event      
of a subsequent change in circumstances.                                        
FMR may not buy all of these instruments or use all of these techniques to      
the full extent permitted unless it believes that doing so will help the        
funds achieve their goals. As a shareholder, you will receive financial         
reports every six months detailing fund holdings and describing recent          
investment activities.                                                          
DEBT SECURITIES. Bonds and other debt instruments are used by issuers to        
borrow money from investors. The issuer pays the investor a fixed or            
variable rate of interest, and must repay the amount borrowed at maturity.      
Some debt securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current             
interest, but are purchased at a discount from their face values. Debt          
securities have varying degrees of quality and varying levels of                
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Longer-term bonds are generally       
more sensitive to interest rate changes than short-term bonds.                  
Lower-quality debt securities (sometimes called "municipal junk bonds") may     
have speculative characteristics, and involve greater risk of default or        
price changes due to changes in the issuer's creditworthiness. The market       
prices of these securities may fluctuate more than higher-quality               
securities and may decline significantly in periods of general or regional      
economic difficulty.

RESTRICTIONS: Spartan Arizona Municipal Income does not currently intend to     
invest more than one-third of its assets in non-investment grade debt           
securities (investment grade debt securities are those rated Baa or above       
by Moody's or BBB by S&amp;P, and unrated securities judegd by FMR to be of     
equivalent quality). The fund currently intends to limit its investments in     
debt securities to those rated B or above, and unrated securities judged by     
FMR to be of equivalent quality.                                                
MUNICIPAL SECURITIES are issued to raise money for a variety of public          
purposes, including general financing for state and local governments, or       
financing for specific projects or public facilities. Municipal securities      
may be issued in anticipation of future revenues, and may be backed by the      
full taxing power of a municipality, the revenues from a specific project,      
or the credit of a private organization. A security's credit may be             
enhanced by a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution. A        
fund may own a municipal security directly or through a participation           
interest.                                                                       
STATE TAX-FREE SECURITIES include municipal obligations issued by the state     
of Arizona or its counties, municipalities, authorities, or other               
subdivisions. The ability of issuers to repay their debt can be affected by     
many factors that impact the economic vitality of either the state or a         
region within the state.                                                        
Other state tax-free securities include general obligations of U.S.             
territories and possessions such as Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto        
Rico, and their political subdivisions and public corporations. The economy     
of Puerto Rico is closely linked to the U.S. economy, and will depend on        
the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, the price stability of oil     
imports, and the continued existence of favorable tax incentives. Recent        
legislation reduced these incentives, but it is impossible to predict what      
impact the changes will have.                                                   
MUNICIPAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS are used by municipalities to acquire land,         
equipment, or facilities. If the municipality stops making payments or          
transfers its obligations to a private entity, the obligation could lose        
value or become taxable.                                                        
PRIVATE ENTITIES may be involved in some municipal securities. For example,     
industrial revenue bonds are backed by private entities, and resource           
recovery bonds often involve private corporations. The viability of a           
project or tax incentives could affect the value and credit quality of          
these securities.                                                               
ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES may include pools of purchase contracts, financing      
leases, or sales agreements entered into by municipalities. These               
securities usually rely on continued payments by a municipality, and may        
also be subject to prepayment risk.                                             
VARIABLE- AND FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENTS may have interest rates that move       
in tandem with a benchmark, helping to stabilize their prices. Inverse          
floaters have interest rates that move in the opposite direction from the       
benchmark, making the instrument's market value more volatile.                  
PUT FEATURES entitle the holder to put (sell back) an instrument to the         
issuer or a financial intermediary. In exchange for this benefit, a fund        
may pay periodic fees or accept a lower interest rate. Demand features,         
standby commitments, and tender options are types of put features.              
ADJUSTING INVESTMENT EXPOSURE. A fund can use various techniques to             
increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices, interest         
rates,  or other factors that affect security values. These techniques may      
involve derivative transactions such as buying and selling options and          
futures contracts and purchasing indexed securities.                            
FMR can use these practices to adjust the risk and return characteristics       
of a fund's portfolio of investments. If FMR judges market conditions           
incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with the         
fund's investments, these techniques could result in a loss, regardless of      
whether the intent was to reduce risk or increase return. These techniques      
may increase the volatility of the fund and may involve a small investment      
of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed. In addition, these       
techniques could result in a loss if the counterparty to the transaction        
does not perform as promised.                                                   
WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED-DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS are trading practices in          
which payment and delivery for the securities take place at a future date.      
The market value of a security could change during this period, which could     
affect a fund's yield or the market value of its assets.                        
ILLIQUID AND RESTRICTED SECURITIES. Some investments may be determined by       
FMR, under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, to be illiquid, which      
means that they may be difficult to sell promptly at an acceptable price.       
The sale of other securities, including illiquid securities, may be subject     
to legal restrictions. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a         
loss or may be costly to a fund.                                                
RESTRICTIONS: A fund may not purchase a security if, as a result, more than     
10% of its assets would be invested in illiquid securities.                     
DIVERSIFICATION. Diversifying a fund's investment portfolio can reduce the      
risks of investing. This may include limiting the amount of money invested      
in any one issuer or, on a broader scale, in any one industry or type of        
project. Economic, business, or political changes can affect all securities     
of a similar type. A fund that is not diversified may be more sensitive to      
these changes, and also to changes in the market value of a single issuer       
or industry.                                                                    
RESTRICTIONS: The funds are considered non-diversified. Generally, to meet      
federal tax requirements at the close of each quarter, a fund does not          
invest more than 25% of its total assets in any one issuer and, with            
respect to 50% of total assets, does not invest more than 5% of its total       
assets in any one issuer. These limitations do not apply to U.S. government     
securities. A fund may invest more than 25% of its total assets in tax-free     
securities that finance similar types of projects.                              
BORROWING. A fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by FMR,     
or through reverse repurchase agreements. If a bond fund borrows money, its     
share price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is        
paid off. If the fund makes additional investments while borrowings are         
outstanding, this may be considered a form of leverage.                         
RESTRICTIONS: A fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, but        
not in an amount exceeding 33% of its total assets.                             
FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS                                
Some of the policies and restrictions discussed on the preceding pages are      
fundamental, that is, subject to change only by shareholder approval. The       
following paragraphs restate all those that are fundamental. All policies       
stated throughout this prospectus, other than those identified in the           
following paragraphs, can be changed without shareholder approval.              
SPARTAN ARIZONA MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET seeks as high a level of current         
income exempt from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax, as       
is consistent with preservation of capital.                                     
SPARTAN ARIZONA MUNICIPAL INCOME seeks a high level of current income,          
exempt from federal income tax and Arizona personal income tax.                 
EACH FUND normally invests at least 80% of its assets in municipal              
securities whose interest is free from federal income tax. Each fund may        
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, but not in an amount exceeding      
33% of its total assets.                                                        
BREAKDOWN OF EXPENSES                                                           
Like all mutual funds, the funds pay fees related to their daily                
operations. Expenses paid out of a fund's assets are reflected in its share     
price or dividends; they are neither billed directly to shareholders nor        
deducted from shareholder accounts.                                             
Each fund pays a MANAGEMENT FEE to FMR for managing its investments and         
business affairs. FMR in turn pays fees to an affiliate who provides            
assistance with these services for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market.      
FMR may, from time to time, agree to reimburse the funds for management         
fees above a specified limit. FMR retains the ability to be repaid by a         
fund if expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the         
fiscal year. Reimbursement arrangements, which may be terminated at any         
time without notice, can decrease a fund's expenses and boost its               
performance.                                                                    
MANAGEMENT FEE                                                                  
The management fee is calculated and paid to FMR every month. Each fund         
pays a management fee at a fixed annual rate of its average net assets:         
.50% for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market and .55% for Spartan            
Arizona Municipal Income.                                                       
FMR HAS A SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT with FTX, which has primary responsibility     
for providing investment management for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money         
Market, while FMR retains responsibility for providing other management         
services. FMR pays FTX 50% of its management fee (before expense                
reimbursements) for these services.                                             
FSC performs many transaction and accounting functions for the funds. These     
services include processing shareholder transactions and calculating each       
fund's share price. FMR, and not the funds, pays for these services.            
To offset shareholder service costs, FMR or its affiliates also collect the     
funds' $5.00 exchange fee, $5.00 account closeout fee, $5.00 fee for wire       
purchases and redemptions, and, for Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market,     
the $2.00 checkwriting charge.                                                  
Each fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan. These plans              
recognize that FMR may use its resources, including management fees, to pay     
expenses associated with the sale of fund shares. This may include payments     
to third parties, such as banks or broker-dealers, that provide shareholder     
support services or engage in the sale of the fund's shares. It is              
important to note, however, that the funds do not pay FMR any separate fees     
for this service.

SPARTAN APPROACH(Registered trademark)                                          
Fidelity's Spartan Approach is                                                  
based on the principle that                                                     
lower fund expenses can                                                         
increase returns. The Spartan                                                   
funds keep expenses low in                                                      
two ways. First, higher                                                         
investment minimums reduce                                                      
the effect of a fund's fixed                                                    
costs, many of which are paid                                                   
on a per-account basis.                                                         
Second, unlike most mutual

As with any investment, you should consider how an investment in a tax-free     
fund could affect you. Below are some of the funds' tax implications.           
TAXES ON DISTRIBUTIONS. Interest income that a fund earns is distributed to     
shareholders as income dividends. Interest that is federally tax-free           
remains tax-free when it is distributed.                                        
However, gain on the sale of tax-free bonds results in taxable                  
distributions. Short-term capital gains and a portion of the gain on bonds      
purchased at a discount are taxed as dividends. Long-term capital gain          
distributions are taxed as long-term capital gains. These distributions are     
taxable when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them.     
However, distributions declared in December and paid in January are taxable     
as if they were paid on December 31. Fidelity will send you and the IRS a       
statement showing the tax status of the distributions paid to you in the        
previous year.                                                                  
The interest from some municipal securities is subject to the federal           
alternative minimum tax. Each fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in       
these securities. Individuals who are subject to the tax must report this       
interest on their tax returns.                                                  
To the extent a fund's income dividends are derived from Arizona state          
tax-free investments, they will be free from Arizona state income tax.          
TAXES ON TRANSACTIONS. Your bond fund redemptions - including exchanges to      
other Fidelity funds - are subject to capital gains tax. A capital gain or      
loss is the difference between the cost of your shares and the price you        
receive when you sell them.                                                     
Whenever you sell shares of a fund, Fidelity will send you a confirmation       
statement showing how many shares you sold and at what price. You will also     
receive a consolidated transaction statement every January. However, it is      
up to you or your tax preparer to determine whether this sale resulted in a     
capital gain and, if so, the amount of tax to be paid. Be sure to keep your     
regular account statements; the information they contain will be essential      
in calculating the amount of your capital gains.                                
"BUYING A DIVIDEND." If you buy shares just before a fund deducts a capital     
gain distribution from its NAV, you will pay the full price for the shares      
and then receive a portion of the price back in the form of a taxable           
distribution.                                                                   
TRANSACTION DETAILS                                                             
THE FUNDS ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)     
is open. Fidelity normally calculates each fund's NAV as of the close of        
business of the NYSE, normally 4 p.m. Eastern time.                             
EACH FUND'S NAV is the value of a single share. The NAV is computed by          
adding the value of the fund's investments, cash, and other assets,             
subtracting its liabilities, and then dividing the result by the number of      
shares outstanding.                                                             
The money market fund values the securities it owns on the basis of             
amortized cost. This method minimizes the effect of changes in a security's     
market value and helps the fund to maintain a stable $1.00 share price. For     
the bond fund, assets are valued primarily on the basis of market               
quotations, if available. Since market quotations are often unavailable,        
assets are usually valued by a method that the Board of Trustees believes       
accurately reflects fair value.                                                 
EACH FUND'S OFFERING PRICE (price to buy one share) and REDEMPTION PRICE        
(price to sell one share) are its NAV.                                          
WHEN YOU SIGN YOUR ACCOUNT APPLICATION, you will be asked to certify that       
your Social Security or taxpayer identification number is correct and that      
you are not subject to 31% backup withholding for failing to report income      
to the IRS. If you violate IRS regulations, the IRS can require a fund to       
withhold 31% of your taxable distributions and redemptions.                     
YOU MAY INITIATE MANY TRANSACTIONS BY TELEPHONE. Note that Fidelity will        
not be responsible for any losses resulting from unauthorized transactions      
if it follows reasonable procedures designed to verify the identity of the      
caller. Fidelity will request personalized security codes or other              
information, and may also record calls. You should verify the accuracy of       
your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them. If you do      
not want the ability to redeem and exchange by telephone, call Fidelity for     
instructions.                                                                   
IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO REACH FIDELITY BY PHONE (for example, during periods       
of unusual market activity), consider placing your order by mail or by          
visiting a Fidelity Investor Center.                                            
EACH FUND RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND THE OFFERING OF SHARES for a period     
of time. Each fund also reserves the right to reject any specific purchase      
order, including certain purchases by exchange. See "Exchange Restrictions"     
on page . Purchase orders may be refused if, in FMR's opinion, they would       
disrupt management of a fund.                                                   
WHEN YOU PLACE AN ORDER TO BUY SHARES, your order will be processed at the      
next offering price calculated after your order is received and accepted.       
Note the following:                                                             
(bullet)  All of your purchases must be made in U.S. dollars and checks         
must be drawn on U.S. banks.                                                    
(bullet)  Fidelity does not accept cash.                                        
(bullet)  When making a purchase with more than one check, each check must      
have a value of at least $50.                                                   
(bullet)  Each fund reserves the right to limit the number of checks            
processed at one time.                                                          
(bullet)  If your check does not clear, your purchase will be cancelled and     
you could be liable for any losses or fees a fund or its transfer agent has     
incurred.                                                                       
(bullet)  You begin to earn dividends as of the first business day              
following the day of your purchase.                                             
TO AVOID THE COLLECTION PERIOD associated with check and Money Line             
purchases, consider buying shares by bank wire, U.S. Postal money order,        
U.S. Treasury check, Federal Reserve check, or direct deposit instead.          
YOU MAY BUY OR SELL SHARES OF THE FUNDS THROUGH A BROKER, who may charge        
you a fee for this service. If you invest through a broker or other             
institution, read its program materials for any additional service features     
or fees that may apply.                                                         
CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS that have entered into sales agreements with     
FDC may enter confirmed purchase orders on behalf of customers by phone,        
with payment to follow no later than the time when a fund is priced on the      
following business day. If payment is not received by that time, the            
financial institution could be held liable for resulting fees or losses.        
WHEN YOU PLACE AN ORDER TO SELL SHARES, your shares will be sold at the         
next NAV calculated after your request is received and accepted. Note the       
following:                                                                      
(bullet)  Normally, redemption proceeds will be mailed to you on the next       
business day, but if making immediate payment could adversely affect a          
fund, it may take up to seven days to pay you.                                  
(bullet)  Shares will earn dividends through the date of redemption;            
however, shares redeemed on a Friday or prior to a holiday will continue to     
earn dividends until the next business day.                                     
(bullet)  Fidelity Money Line redemptions generally will be credited to         
your bank account on the second or third business day after your phone          
call.                                                                           
(bullet)  Each fund may hold payment on redemptions until it is reasonably      
satisfied that investments made by check or Fidelity Money Line have been       
collected, which can take up to seven business days.                            
(bullet)  Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the      
NYSE is closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE      
is restricted, or as permitted by the SEC.                                      
(bullet)  If you sell shares by writing a check and the amount of the check     
is greater than the value of your account, your check will be returned to       
you and you may be subject to additional charges.                               
THE REDEMPTION FEE for Spartan Arizona Municipal Income, if applicable,         
will be deducted from the amount of your redemption. This fee is paid to        
the fund rather than FMR, and it does not apply to shares that were             
acquired through reinvestment of distributions. If shares you are redeeming     
were not all held for the same length of time, those shares you held            
longest will be redeemed first for purposes of determining whether the fee      
applies.                                                                        
THE FEES FOR INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS are waived if your account balance at      
the time of the transaction is $50,000 or more. Otherwise, you should note      
the following:                                                                  
(bullet)  The $2.00 checkwriting charge will be deducted from your account.     
(bullet)  The $5.00 exchange fee will be deducted from the amount of your       
exchange.                                                                       
(bullet)  The $5.00 wire fee will be deducted from the amount of your wire.     
(bullet)  The $5.00 account closeout fee does not apply to exchanges or         
wires, but it will apply to checkwriting.                                       
IF YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE FALLS BELOW $5,000 ($10,000 for Spartan Arizona         
Municipal Money Market), you will be given 30 days' notice to reestablish       
the minimum balance. If you do not increase your balance, Fidelity reserves     
the right to close your account and send the proceeds to you. Your shares       
will be redeemed at the NAV on the day your account is closed and the $5.00     
account closeout fee will be charged.                                           
FIDELITY MAY CHARGE A FEE FOR SPECIAL SERVICES, such as providing               
historical account documents, that are beyond the normal scope of its           
services.                                                                       
EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS                                                           
As a shareholder, you have the privilege of exchanging shares of a fund for     
shares of other Fidelity funds. However, you should note the following:         
(bullet)  The fund you are exchanging into must be registered for sale in       
your state.                                                                     
(bullet)  You may only exchange between accounts that are registered in the     
same name, address, and taxpayer identification number.                         
(bullet)  Before exchanging into a fund, read its prospectus.                   
(bullet)  If you exchange into a fund with a sales charge, you pay the          
percentage-point difference between that fund's sales charge and any sales      
charge you have previously paid in connection with the shares you are           
exchanging. For example, if you had already paid a sales charge of 2% on        
your shares and you exchange them into a fund with a 3% sales charge, you       
would pay an additional 1% sales charge.                                        
(bullet)  Exchanges may have tax consequences for you.                          
(bullet)  Because excessive trading can hurt fund performance and               
shareholders, each fund reserves the right to temporarily or permanently        
terminate the exchange privilege of any investor who makes more than four       
exchanges out of the fund per calendar year. Accounts under common              
ownership or control, including accounts with the same taxpayer                 
identification number, will be counted together for purposes of the four        
exchange limit.                                                                 
(bullet)  Each fund reserves the right to refuse exchange purchases by any      
person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund would be unable to invest       
the money effectively in accordance with its investment objective and           
policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.                 
(bullet)  Your exchanges may be restricted or refused if a fund receives or     
anticipates simultaneous orders affecting significant portions of the           
fund's assets. In particular, a pattern of exchanges that coincide with a       
"market timing" strategy may be disruptive to a fund.                           
Although the funds will attempt to give you prior notice whenever they are      
reasonably able to do so, they may impose these restrictions at any time.       
The funds reserve the right to terminate or modify the exchange privilege       
in the future.                                                                  
OTHER FUNDS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS, and may impose            
administrative fees of up to $7.50 and redemption fees of up to 1.50% on        
exchanges. Check each fund's prospectus for details.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS                                             
The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in the        
Prospectus. Unless otherwise noted, whenever an investment policy or            
limitation states a maximum percentage of a fund's assets that may be           
invested in any security or other asset, or sets forth a policy regarding       
quality standards, such standard or percentage limitation will be               
determined immediately after and as a result of the fund's acquisition of       
such security or other asset. Accordingly, any subsequent change in values,     
net assets, or other circumstances will not be considered when determining      
whether the investment complies with the fund's investment policies and         
limitations.                                                                    
A fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be changed      
without approval of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" (as       
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)) of the fund.      
However, except for the fundamental investment limitations set forth below,     
the investment policies and limitations described in this Statement of          
Additional Information are not fundamental and may be changed without           
shareholder approval.

LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THEIR ENTIRETY. THE FUND MAY NOT:                      
(1) issue senior securities, except as permitted under the Investment           
Company Act of 1940;                                                            
(2) borrow money, except that the fund may borrow money for temporary or        
emergency purposes (not for leveraging or investment) in an amount not          
exceeding 33 1/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less      
liabilities (other than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed         
this amount will be reduced within three days (not including Sundays and        
holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;        
(3) underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the       
fund may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the               
Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities;             
(4) purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or      
guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or                     
instrumentalities, or tax-exempt obligations issued or guaranteed by a U.S.     
territory or possession or a state or local government, or a political          
subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as a result, more than 25% of the      
fund's total assets would be invested in securities of companies whose          
principal business activities are in the same industry;                         
(5) purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership       
of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent the fund         
from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or      
securities of companies engaged in the real estate business);                   
(6) purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of        
ownership of securities or other instruments; or                                
(7) lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33      
1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other parties, but this               
limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase      
agreements.                                                                     
(8) The fund may, notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy       
or limitation, invest all of its assets in the securities of a single           
open-end management investment company with substantially the same              
fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.        
THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS ARE NOT FUNDAMENTAL AND MAY BE CHANGED     
WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.                                                   
(i)  To meet federal tax requirements for qualification as a "regulated         
investment company," the fund limits its investments so that at the close       
of each quarter of its taxable year: (a) with regard to at least 50% of         
total assets, no more than 5% of total assets are invested in the               
securities of a single issuer, and (b) no more than 25% of total assets are     
invested in the securities of a single issuer. Limitations (a) and (b) do       
not apply to "Government securities" as defined for federal tax purposes.       
(ii) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short, unless it     
owns or has the right to obtain securities equivalent in kind and amount to     
the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures            
contracts and options are not deemed to constitute selling securities           
short.                                                                          
(iii) The fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin,      
except that the fund may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary        
for the clearance of transactions, and provided that margin payments in         
connection with futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall        
not constitute purchasing securities on margin.                                 
(iv)  The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered       
investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as         
investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with     
any party (reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings for          
purposes of fundamental investment limitation (2)). The fund will not           
purchase any security while borrowings representing more than 5% of its         
total assets are outstanding. The fund will not borrow from other funds         
advised by FMR or its affiliates if total outstanding borrowings                
immediately after such borrowing would exceed 15% of the fund's total           
assets.                                                                         
(v)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a       
result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in securities         
that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or             
contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be sold or            
disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices      
at which they are valued.                                                       
(vi) The fund does not currently intend to invest more than 25% of its          
total assets in industrial revenue bonds related to a single industry.          
(vii)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase or sell futures           
contracts or call options. This limitation does not apply to options            
attached to, or acquired or traded together with, their underlying              
securities, and does not apply to securities that incorporate features          
similar to options or futures contracts.                                        
(viii)  The fund does not currently intend to engage in repurchase              
agreements or make loans, but this limitation does not apply to purchases       
of debt securities.                                                             
(ix)  The fund does not currently intend to (a) purchase securities of          
other investment companies, except in the open market where no commission       
except the ordinary broker's commission is paid, or (b) purchase or retain      
securities issued by other open-end investment companies. Limitations (a)       
and (b) do not apply to securities received as dividends, through offers of     
exchange, or as a result of a reorganization, consolidation, or merger.         
(x)  The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the      
securities of a single open-end management investment company with              
substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies, and          
limitations as the fund.                                                        
For purposes of limitations (4) and (i), FMR identifies the issuer of a         
security depending on its terms and conditions. In identifying the issuer,      
FMR will consider the entity or entities responsible for payment of             
interest and repayment of principal and the source of such payments; the        
way in which assets and revenues of an issuing political subdivision are        
separated from those of other political entities; and whether a                 
governmental body is guaranteeing the security.                                 
For the money market fund's limitations on quality and maturity, see the        
section entitled "Quality and Maturity" on page __.                             
INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS OF SPARTAN ARIZONA MUNICIPAL INCOME PORTFOLIO            
(INCOME FUND)                                                                   
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE INCOME FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS SET      
FORTH IN THEIR ENTIRETY. THE FUND MAY NOT:                                      
(1) issue senior securities, except as permitted under the Investment           
Company Act of 1940;                                                            
(2) borrow money, except that the fund may borrow money for temporary or        
emergency purposes (not for leveraging or investment) in an amount not          
exceeding 33 1/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less      
liabilities (other than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed         
this amount will be reduced within three days (not including Sundays and        
holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;        
(3) underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the       
fund may be considered an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities      
Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities;                        
(4) purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or      
guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or                     
instrumentalities, or tax-exempt obligations issued or guaranteed by a U.S.     
territory or possession or a state or local government, or a political          
subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as a result, more than 25% of the      
fund's total assets would be invested in securities of companies whose          
principal business activities are in the same industry;                         
(5) purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership       
of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent the fund         
from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or      
securities of companies engaged in the real estate business);                   
(6) purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of        
ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent        
the fund from purchasing or selling options and futures contracts or from       
investing in securities or other instruments backed by physical                 
commodities); or                                                                
(7) lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33      
1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other parties, but this               
limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase      
agreements.                                                                     
(8) The fund may, notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy       
or limitation, invest all of its assets in the securities of a single           
open-end management investment company with substantially the same              
fundamental investment objectives, policies, and limitations as the fund.       
THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS ARE NOT FUNDAMENTAL AND MAY BE CHANGED     
WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.                                                   
(i) To meet federal tax requirements for qualification as a "regulated          
investment company," the fund limits its investments so that at the close       
of each quarter of its taxable year: (a) with regard to at least 50% of         
total assets, no more than 5% of total assets are invested in the               
securities of a single issuer, and (b) no more than 25% of total assets are     
invested in the securities of a single issuer. Limitations (a) and (b) do       
not apply to "government securities" as defined for federal tax purposes.       
(ii) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short, unless it     
owns or has the right to obtain securities equivalent in kind and amount to     
the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures            
contracts and options are not deemed to constitute selling securities           
short.                                                                          
(iii) The fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin,      
except that the fund may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary        
for the clearance of transactions, and provided that margin payments in         
connection with futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall        
not constitute purchasing securities on margin.                                 
(iv) The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered        
investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as         
investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with     
any party (reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings for          
purposes of fundamental investment limitation (2)). The fund will not           
purchase any security while borrowings representing more than 5% of its         
total assets are outstanding. The fund will not borrow from other funds         
advised by FMR or its affiliates if total outstanding borrowings                
immediately after such borrowing would exceed 15% of the fund's total           
assets.                                                                         
(v) The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a        
result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in securities         
that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or             
contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be sold or            
disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices      
at which they are valued.                                                       
(vi) The fund does not currently intend to invest more than 25% of its          
total assets in industrial revenue bonds related to a single industry.          
(vii) The fund does not currently intend to engage in repurchase agreements     
or make loans, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt          
securities.                                                                     
(viii) The fund does not currently intend to (a) purchase securities of         
other investment companies, except in the open market where no commission       
except the ordinary broker's commission is paid, or (b) purchase or retain      
securities issued by other open-end investment companies. Limitations (a)       
and (b) do not apply to securities received as dividends, through offers of     
exchange, or as a result of a reorganization, consolidation, or merger.         
(ix) The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the      
securities of a single open-end management investment company with              
substantially the same fundamental investment objectives, policies, and         
limitations as the fund.                                                        
For purposes of limitations (4) and (i), FMR identifies the issuer of a         
security depending on its terms and conditions. In identifying the issuer,      
FMR will consider the entity or entities responsible for payment of             
interest and repayment of principal and the source of such payments; the        
way in which assets and revenues of an issuing political subdivision are        
separated from those of other political entities; and whether a                 
governmental body is guaranteeing the security.                                 
For the income fund's limitations on futures and options transactions, see      
the section entitled "Limitations on Futures and Options Transactions"          
beginning on page 8.                                                            
AFFILIATED BANK TRANSACTIONS. A fund may engage in transactions with            
financial institutions that are, or may be considered to be, "affiliated        
persons" of the fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These            
transactions may include repurchase agreements with custodian banks;            
short-term obligations of, and repurchase agreements with, the 50 largest       
U.S. banks (measured by deposits); municipal securities; U.S. government        
securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers      
in these securities; short-term currency transactions; and short-term           
borrowings. In accordance with exemptive orders issued by the Securities        
and Exchange Commission, the Board of Trustees has established and              
periodically reviews procedures applicable to transactions involving            
affiliated financial institutions.                                              
QUALITY AND MATURITY (MONEY MARKET FUND ONLY). Pursuant to procedures           
adopted by the Board of Trustees, the fund may purchase only high-quality       
securities that FMR believes present minimal credit risks. To be considered     
high-quality, a security must be a U.S. government security; rated in           
accordance with applicable rules in one of the two highest categories for       
short-term securities by at least two nationally recognized rating services     
(or by one, if only one rating service has rated the security); or, if          
unrated, judged to be of equivalent quality by FMR.                             
The fund currently intends to limit its investments to securities with          
remaining maturities of 397 days or less, and to maintain a dollar-weighted     
average maturity of 90 days or less.                                            
DELAYED-DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. Each fund may buy and sell securities on a       
delayed-delivery or when-issued basis. These transactions involve a             
commitment by a fund to purchase or sell specific securities at a               
predetermined price or yield, with payment and delivery taking place after      
the customary settlement period for that type of security (and more than        
seven days in the future). Typically, no interest accrues to the purchaser      
until the security is delivered. The income fund may receive fees for           
entering into delayed-delivery transactions.                                    
When purchasing securities on a delayed-delivery basis, each fund assumes       
the rights and risks of ownership, including the risk of price and yield        
fluctuations. Because a fund is not required to pay for securities until        
the delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated with     
the fund's other investments. If a fund remains substantially fully             
invested at a time when delayed-delivery purchases are outstanding, the         
delayed-delivery purchases may result in a form of leverage. When               
delayed-delivery purchases are outstanding, the fund will set aside             
appropriate liquid assets in a segregated custodial account to cover its        
purchase obligations. When a fund has sold a security on a delayed-delivery     
basis, the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with            
respect to the security. If the other party to a delayed-delivery               
transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities, the fund could miss     
a favorable price or yield opportunity, or could suffer a loss.                 
Each fund may renegotiate delayed-delivery transactions after they are          
entered into, and may sell underlying securities before they are delivered,     
which may result in capital gains or losses.                                    
REFUNDING CONTRACTS. The income fund may purchase securities on a               
when-issued basis in connection with the refinancing of an issuer's             
outstanding indebtedness. Refunding contracts require the issuer to sell        
and the fund to buy refunded municipal obligations at a stated price and        
yield on a settlement date that may be several months or several years in       
the future. The fund generally will not be obligated to pay the full            
purchase price if it fails to perform under a refunding contract. Instead,      
refunding contracts generally provide for payment of liquidated damages to      
the issuer (currently 15-20% of the purchase price). The fund may secure        
its obligations under a refunding contract by depositing collateral or a        
letter of credit equal to the liquidated damages provisions of the              
refunding contract. When required by SEC guidelines, the fund will place        
liquid assets in a segregated custodial account equal in amount to its          
obligations under refunding contracts.                                          
INVERSE FLOATERS. The income fund may invest in inverse floaters, which are     
instruments whose interest rates bear an inverse relationship to the            
interest rate on another security or the value of an index. Changes in the      
interest rate on the other security or index inversely affect the residual      
interest rate paid on the inverse floater, with the result that the inverse     
floater's price will be considerably more volatile than that of a               
fixed-rate bond. For example, a municipal issuer may decide to issue two        
variable-rate instruments instead of a single long-term, fixed-rate bond.       
The interest rate on one instrument reflects short-term interest rates,         
while the interest rate on the other instrument (the inverse floater)           
reflects the approximate rate the issuer would have paid on a fixed-rate        
bond, multiplied by two, minus the interest rate paid on the short-term         
instrument. Depending on market availability, the two portions may be           
recombined to form a fixed-rate municipal bond. The market for inverse          
floaters is relatively new.                                                     
VARIABLE OR FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS bear variable or floating interest        
rates and carry rights that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid      
principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain             
financial intermediaries. Floating rate instruments have interest rates         
that change whenever there is a change in a designated base rate while          
variable rate instruments provide for a specified periodic adjustment in        
the interest rate. These formulas are designed to result in a market value      
for the instrument that approximates its par value.                             
With respect to the money market fund, a demand instrument with a               
conditional demand feature must have received both a short-term and a           
long-term high-quality rating or, if unrated, have been determined to be of     
comparable quality pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.     
A demand instrument with an unconditional demand feature may be acquired        
solely in reliance upon a short-term high-quality rating or, if unrated,        
upon a finding of comparable short-term quality pursuant to procedures          
adopted by the Board of Trustees.                                               
The funds may invest in fixed-rate bonds that are subject to third party        
puts and in participation interests in such bonds held in trust or              
otherwise. These bonds and participation interests have tender options or       
demand features that permit a fund to tender (or put) the bonds to an           
institution at periodic intervals and to receive the principal amount           
thereof. A fund considers variable rate instruments structured in this way      
(Participating VRDOs) to be essentially equivalent to other VRDOs it            
purchases. The IRS has not ruled whether the interest on Participating          
VRDOs is tax-exempt and, accordingly, a fund intends to purchase these          
instruments based on opinions of bond counsel.                                  
The money market fund may invest in variable or floating rate instruments       
that ultimately mature in more than 397 days, if the fund acquires a right      
to sell the instruments that meets certain requirements set forth in Rule       
2a-7. Variable rate instruments (including instruments subject to a demand      
feature) that mature in 397 days or less may be deemed to have maturities       
equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest       
rate. Other variable rate instruments with demand features may be deemed to     
have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next adjustment of      
the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be     
recovered through demand. A floating rate instrument subject to a demand        
feature may be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining          
until the principal amount can be recovered through demand.                     
TENDER OPTION BONDS are created by coupling an intermediate- or long-term,      
fixed-rate, tax-exempt bond (generally held pursuant to a custodial             
arrangement) with a tender agreement that gives the holder the option to        
tender the bond at its face value. As consideration for providing the           
tender option, the sponsor (usually a bank, broker-dealer, or other             
financial institution) receives periodic fees equal to the difference           
between the bond's fixed coupon rate and the rate (determined by a              
remarketing or similar agent) that would cause the bond, coupled with the       
tender option, to trade at par on the date of such determination. After         
payment of the tender option fee, a fund effectively holds a demand             
obligation that bears interest at the prevailing short-term tax-exempt          
rate. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, the money market fund      
may buy tender option bonds if the agreement gives the fund the right to        
tender the bond to its sponsor no less frequently than once every 397 days.     
In selecting tender option bonds for the funds, FMR will consider the           
creditworthiness of the issuer of the underlying bond, the custodian, and       
the third party provider of the tender option. In certain instances, a          
sponsor may terminate a tender option if, for example, the issuer of the        
underlying bond defaults on interest payments.                                  
ZERO COUPON BONDS do not make regular interest payments. Instead, they are      
sold at a deep discount from their face value and are redeemed at face          
value when they mature. Because zero coupon bonds do not pay current            
income, their prices can be very volatile when interest rates change. In        
calculating its daily dividend, a fund takes into account as income a           
portion of the difference between a zero coupon bond's purchase price and       
its face value.                                                                 
STANDBY COMMITMENTS are puts that entitle holders to same-day settlement at     
an exercise price equal to the amortized cost of the underlying security        
plus accrued interest, if any, at the time of exercise. Each fund may           
acquire standby commitments to enhance the liquidity of portfolio               
securities, but, in the case of the money market fund, only when the            
issuers of the commitments present minimal risk of default.                     
Ordinarily a fund will not transfer a standby commitment to a third party,      
although it could sell the underlying municipal security to a third party       
at any time. A fund may purchase standby commitments separate from or in        
conjunction with the purchase of securities subject to such commitments. In     
the latter case, the fund would pay a higher price for the securities           
acquired, thus reducing their yield to maturity. Standby commitments will       
not affect the dollar-weighted average maturity of the money market fund,       
or the valuation of the securities underlying the commitments.                  
Issuers or financial intermediaries may obtain letters of credit or other       
guarantees to support their ability to buy securities on demand. FMR may        
rely upon its evaluation of a bank's credit in determining whether to           
support an instrument supported by a letter of credit. In evaluating a          
foreign bank's credit, FMR will consider whether adequate public                
information about the bank is available and whether the bank may be subject     
to unfavorable political or economic developments, currency controls, or        
other governmental restrictions that might affect the bank's ability to         
honor its credit commitment.                                                    
Standby commitments are subject to certain risks, including the ability of      
issuers of standby commitments to pay for securities at the time the            
commitments are exercised; the fact that standby commitments are not            
marketable by the funds; and the possibility that the maturities of the         
underlying securities may be different from those of the commitments.           
MUNICIPAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS. Each fund may invest a portion of its assets       
in municipal leases and participation interests therein. These obligations,     
which may take the form of a lease, an installment purchase, or a               
conditional sale contract, are issued by state and local governments and        
authorities to acquire land and a wide variety of equipment and facilities.     
Generally, the funds will not hold such obligations directly as a lessor of     
the property, but will purchase a participation interest in a municipal         
obligation from a bank or other third party. A participation interest gives     
a fund a specified, undivided interest in the obligation in proportion to       
its purchased interest in the total amount of the obligation.                   
Municipal leases frequently have risks distinct from those associated with      
general obligation or revenue bonds. State constitutions and statutes set       
forth requirements that states or municipalities must meet to incur debt.       
These may include voter referenda, interest rate limits, or public sale         
requirements. Leases, installment purchases, or conditional sale contracts      
(which normally provide for title to the leased asset to pass to the            
governmental issuer) have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to        
acquire property and equipment without meeting their constitutional and         
statutory requirements for the issuance of debt. Many leases and contracts      
include "non-appropriation clauses" providing that the governmental issuer      
has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract           
unless money is appropriated for such purposes by the appropriate               
legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis. Non-appropriation         
clauses free the issuer from debt issuance limitations.                         
FEDERALLY TAXABLE OBLIGATIONS. The funds do not intend to invest in             
securities whose interest is federally taxable; however, from time to time,     
each fund may invest a portion of its assets on a temporary basis in            
fixed-income obligations whose interest is subject to federal income tax.       
For example, each fund may invest in obligations whose interest is              
federally taxable pending the investment or reinvestment in municipal           
securities of proceeds from the sale of its shares or sales of portfolio        
securities.                                                                     
Should a fund invest in federally taxable obligations, it would purchase        
securities that in FMR's judgment are of high quality. These would include      
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or      
instrumentalities; obligations of domestic banks; and repurchase                
agreements. The income fund's standards for high quality, taxable               
obligations are essentially the same as those described by Moody's              
Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) in rating corporate obligations within        
its two highest ratings of Prime-1 and Prime-2, and those described by          
Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (S&amp;P) in rating corporate obligations     
within its two highest ratings of A-1 and A-2. The money market fund will       
purchase taxable obligations only if they meet its quality requirements.        
Proposals to restrict or eliminate the federal income tax exemption for         
interest on municipal obligations are introduced before Congress from time      
to time. Proposals also may be introduced before the Arizona legislature        
that would affect the state tax treatment of the funds' distributions. If       
such proposals were enacted, the availability of municipal obligations and      
the value of the funds' holdings would be affected and the Trustees would       
reevaluate the funds' investment objectives and policies.                       
Each fund anticipates being as fully invested as practicable in municipal       
securities; however, there may be occasions when, as a result of maturities     
of portfolio securities, sales of fund shares, or in order to meet              
redemption requests, a fund may hold cash that is not earning income. In        
addition, there may be occasions when, in order to raise cash to meet           
redemptions, a fund may be required to sell securities at a loss.               
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. In a repurchase agreement, a fund purchases a            
security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller       
at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon date within a number of days from     
the date of purchase. The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an      
agreed-upon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or         
maturity of the purchased security. A repurchase agreement is a taxable         
obligation which involves the obligation of the seller to pay the               
agreed-upon price, which obligation is in effect secured by the value (at       
least equal to the amount of the agreed-upon resale price and marked to         
market daily) of the underlying security. Each fund may engage in               
repurchase agreements with respect to any security in which it is               
authorized to invest even if, with respect to the money market fund, the        
underlying security matures in more than 397 days. While it does not            
presently appear possible to eliminate all risks from these transactions        
(particularly the possibility of a decline in the market value of the           
underlying securities, as well as delays and costs to the fund in               
connection with bankruptcy proceedings), it is each fund's current policy       
to limit repurchase agreements to parties whose creditworthiness has been       
reviewed and found satisfactory by FMR.                                         
REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. In a reverse repurchase agreement, a fund        
sells a portfolio instrument to another party, such as a bank or                
broker-dealer, in return for cash and agrees to repurchase the instrument       
at a particular price and time. While a reverse repurchase agreement is         
outstanding, the fund will maintain appropriate liquid assets in a              
segregated custodial account to cover its obligation under the agreement. A     
fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only with parties whose      
creditworthiness has been found satisfactory by FMR. Such transactions may      
increase fluctuations in the market value of a fund's assets and may be         
viewed as a form of leverage.                                                   
ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS are investments that cannot be sold or disposed of in      
the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they       
are valued. Under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, FMR determines      
the liquidity of a fund's investments and, through reports from FMR, the        
Board monitors investments in illiquid instruments. In determining the          
liquidity of a fund's investments, FMR may consider various factors,            
including (1) the frequency of trades and quotations, (2) the number of         
dealers and prospective purchasers in the marketplace, (3) dealer               
undertakings to make a market, (4) the nature of the security (including        
any demand or tender features), and (5) the nature of the marketplace for       
trades (including the ability to assign or offset a fund's rights and           
obligations relating to the investment).                                        
FMR may determine some restricted securities and municipal lease                
obligations to be illiquid for each fund. Investments currently considered      
by the income fund to be illiquid include over-the-counter options.             
However, with respect to over-the-counter options the income fund writes,       
all or a portion of the value of the underlying instrument may be illiquid      
depending on the assets held to cover the option and the nature and terms       
of any agreement the fund may have to close out the option before               
expiration.                                                                     
In the absence of market quotations, illiquid investments are valued for        
purposes of monitoring amortized cost valuation (money market fund) or          
priced (income fund) at fair value as determined in good faith by a             
committee appointed by the Board of Trustees. If through a change in            
values, net assets, or other circumstances, a fund were in a position where     
more than 10% of its net assets were invested in illiquid securities, it        
would seek to take appropriate steps to protect liquidity.                      
RESTRICTED SECURITIES generally can be sold in privately negotiated             
transactions, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the              
Securities Act of 1933, or in a registered public offering. Where               
registration is required, a fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the     
registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time      
it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a      
security under an effective registration statement. If, during such a           
period, adverse market conditions were to develop, a fund might obtain a        
less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of     
the security. However, in general, the money market fund anticipates            
holding restricted securities to maturity or selling them in an exempt          
transaction.                                                                    
INDEXED SECURITIES. The income fund may purchase securities whose prices        
are indexed to the prices of other securities, securities indices, or other     
financial indicators. Indexed securities typically, but not always, are         
debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is           
determined by reference to a specific instrument or statistic. Indexed          
securities have principal payments as well as coupon payments that depend       
on the performance of one or more interest rates. Their coupon rates or         
principal payments may change by several percentage points for every 1%         
interest rate change. One example of indexed securities is inverse              
floaters.                                                                       
The performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the          
performance of the security or other instrument to which they are indexed,      
and may also be influenced by interest rate changes. At the same time,          
indexed securities are subject to the credit risks associated with the          
issuer of the security, and their values may decline substantially if the       
issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates. Indexed securities may be more          
volatile than the underlying instruments.                                       
LOWER-QUALITY MUNICIPAL SECURITIES. The income fund may invest a portion of     
its assets in lower-quality municipal securities as described in the            
Prospectus.                                                                     
While the market for Arizona municipals is considered to be adequate,           
adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the ability      
of outside pricing services used by the fund to value its portfolio             
securities, and the fund's ability to dispose of lower-quality bonds. The       
outside pricing services are monitored by FMR and reported to the Board to      
determine whether the services are furnishing prices that accurately            
reflect fair value. The impact of changing investor perceptions may be          
especially pronounced in markets where municipal securities are thinly          
traded.                                                                         
The fund may choose, at its expense or in conjunction with others, to           
pursue litigation or otherwise exercise its rights as a security holder to      
seek to protect the interests of security holders if it determines this to      
be in the best interest of the fund's shareholders.                             
INTERFUND BORROWING PROGRAM. Each fund has received permission from the SEC     
to lend money to and borrow money from other funds advised by FMR or its        
affiliates, but will participate in the interfund borrowing program only as     
a borrower. Interfund loans normally will extend overnight, but can have a      
maximum duration of seven days. A fund will borrow through the program only     
when the costs are equal to or lower than the costs of bank loans. Loans        
may be called on one day's notice, and the fund may have to borrow from a       
bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not            
renewed.                                                                        
ELECTRIC UTILITIES INDUSTRY. The electric utilities industry has been           
experiencing, or may experience in the future, problems, including (a) the      
effects of inflation upon construction and operating costs, (b) the             
availability and cost of fuel, (c) the availability and cost of capital,        
(d) the effects of conservation on energy demand, (e) the effects of            
rapidly changing environmental, safety, and licensing requirements, and         
other federal, state, and local regulations, (f) timely and sufficient rate     
increases, (g) opposition to nuclear power, and (h) increased competition.      
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. The health care industry is subject to regulatory         
action by a number of private and governmental agencies, including federal,     
state, and local governmental agencies. A major source of revenues for the      
health care industry is payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.       
As a result, the industry is sensitive to legislative changes and               
reductions in governmental spending for such programs. Numerous other           
factors may affect the industry, such as general and local economic             
conditions; demand for services; expenses (including malpractice insurance      
premiums); and competition among health care providers. In the future, the      
following elements may adversely affect health care facility operations:        
adoption of legislation proposing a national health insurance program;          
medical and technological advances which dramatically alter the need for        
health services or the way in which such services are delivered; and            
efforts by employers, insurers, and governmental agencies to reduce the         
costs of health insurance and healthcare services.                              
HOUSING. Housing revenue bonds are generally issued by a state, county,         
city, local housing authority, or other public agency. They are secured by      
the revenues derived from mortgages purchased with the proceeds from the        
bond issue. It is extremely difficult to predict the supply of available        
mortgages to be purchased with the proceeds of an issue or the future cash      
flow from the underlying mortgages. Consequently, there are risks that          
proceeds will exceed supply, resulting in early retirement of bonds, or         
that the homeowner repayments will create an irregular cash flow.               
Many factors may affect the financing of multi-family housing projects,         
including acceptable completion of construction, proper management,             
occupancy and rent levels, economic conditions, and changes to current laws     
and regulations.                                                                
EDUCATION.  In general, there are two types of education-related bonds;         
those issued to finance projects for public colleges and universities, and      
those representing pooled interests in student loans.  Bonds issued to          
supply public educational institutions with funds are subject to the risk       
of unanticipated revenue decline. Among the factors that may affect             
enrollment are restrictions on students' ability to pay tuition,                
availability of state and federal funding, and general economic conditions.     
Student loan revenue bonds are backed by pools of student loans and are         
generally offered by state (or substate) authorities or commissions.            
Student loans are guaranteed by state guarantee agencies and reinsured by       
the Department of Education.  The risks associated with these issues is         
that default on the student loans may result in prepayment to bondholders       
and an earlier-than-anticipated retirement of the bond.                         
INVESTMENT POLICIES FOR INCOME FUND ONLY                                        
LIMITATIONS ON FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS. The fund intends to file a     
notice of eligibility for exclusion from the definition of the term             
"commodity pool operator" with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission         
(CFTC) and the National Futures Association, which regulate trading in the      
futures markets before engaging in any purchases or sales of futures            
contracts or options on futures contracts. The fund intends to comply with      
Rule 4.5 under the Commodity Exchange Act, which limits the extent to which     
the fund can commit assets to initial margin deposits and option premiums.      
In addition, the fund will not: (a) sell futures contracts, purchase put        
options, or write call options if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's     
total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal              
conditions; (b) purchase futures contracts or write put options if, as a        
result, the fund's total obligations upon settlement or exercise of             
purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed 25% of its     
total assets; or (c) purchase call options if, as a result, the current         
value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would           
exceed 5% of the fund's total assets. These limitations do not apply to         
options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying        
securities, and do not apply to securities that incorporate features            
similar to options.                                                             
The above limitations on the fund's investments in futures contracts and        
options, and the fund's policies regarding futures contracts and options        
discussed elsewhere in this Statement of Additional Information, may be         
changed as regulatory agencies permit.                                          
FUTURES CONTRACTS. When the fund purchases a futures contract, it agrees to     
purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date. When     
the fund sells a futures contract, it agrees to sell the underlying             
instrument at a specified future date. The price at which the purchase and      
sale will take place is fixed when the fund enters into the contract. Some      
currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities,         
such as U.S. Treasury bonds or notes, and some are based on indices of          
securities prices, such as the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index. Futures can     
be held until their delivery dates, or can be closed out before then if a       
liquid secondary market is available.                                           
The value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem        
with the value of its underlying instrument. Therefore, purchasing futures      
contracts will tend to increase the fund's exposure to positive and             
negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument, much as if it had     
purchased the underlying instrument directly. When the fund sells a futures     
contract, by contrast, the value of its futures position will tend to move      
in a direction contrary to the market. Selling futures contracts,               
therefore, will tend to offset both positive and negative market price          
changes, much as if the underlying instrument had been sold.                    
FUTURES MARGIN PAYMENTS. The purchaser or seller of a futures contract is       
not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the         
contract is held until the delivery date. However, both the purchaser and       
seller are required to deposit "initial margin" with a futures broker,          
known as a futures commission merchant (FCM), when the contract is entered      
into. Initial margin deposits are typically equal to a percentage of the        
contract's value. If the value of either party's position declines, that        
party will be required to make additional "variation margin" payments to        
settle the change in value on a daily basis. The party that has a gain may      
be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount. Initial and             
variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin     
for purposes of the fund's investment limitations. In the event of the          
bankruptcy of an FCM that holds margin on behalf of a fund, the fund may be     
entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount        
received by the FCM's other customers, potentially resulting in losses to       
the fund.                                                                       
PURCHASING PUT AND CALL OPTIONS. By purchasing a put option, the fund           
obtains the right (but not the obligation) to sell the option's underlying      
instrument at a fixed strike price. In return for this right, the fund pays     
the current market price for the option (known as the option premium).          
Options have various types of underlying instruments, including specific        
securities, indices of securities prices, and futures contracts. The fund       
may terminate its position in a put option it has purchased by allowing it      
to expire or by exercising the option. If the option is allowed to expire,      
the fund will lose the entire premium it paid. If the fund exercises the        
option, it completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike        
price. The fund may also terminate a put option position by closing it out      
in the secondary market at its current price, if a liquid secondary market      
exists.                                                                         
The buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security      
prices fall substantially. However, if the underlying instrument's price        
does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option, a put         
buyer can expect to suffer a loss (limited to the amount of the premium         
paid, plus related transaction costs).                                          
The features of call options are essentially the same as those of put           
options, except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to        
purchase, rather than sell, the underlying instrument at the option's           
strike price. A call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential       
price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost      
of the option if security prices fall. At the same time, the buyer can          
expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to          
offset the cost of the option.                                                  
WRITING PUT AND CALL OPTIONS. When the fund writes a put option, it takes       
the opposite side of the transaction from the option's purchaser. In return     
for receipt of the premium, the fund assumes the obligation to pay the          
strike price for the option's underlying instrument if the other party to       
the option chooses to exercise it. When writing an option on a futures          
contract, the fund will be required to make margin payments to an FCM as        
described above for futures contracts. The fund may seek to terminate its       
position in a put option it writes before exercise by closing out the           
option in the secondary market at its current price. If the secondary           
market is not liquid for a put option the fund has written, however, the        
fund must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option      
is outstanding, regardless of price changes, and must continue to set aside     
assets to cover its position.                                                   
If security prices rise, a put writer generally would expect to profit,         
although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it              
received. If security prices remain the same over time, it is likely that       
the writer will also profit, because it should be able to close out the         
option at a lower price. If security prices fall, the put writer would          
expect to suffer a loss. This loss should be less than the loss from            
purchasing the underlying instrument directly, however, because the premium     
received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline.     
Writing a call option obligates the fund to sell or deliver the option's        
underlying instrument, in return for the strike price, upon exercise of the     
option. The characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of     
writing put options, except that writing calls generally is a profitable        
strategy if prices remain the same or fall. Through receipt of the option       
premium, a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline. At the         
same time, because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying     
instrument in return for the strike price, even if its current value is         
greater, a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security         
price increases.                                                                
COMBINED POSITIONS. The fund may purchase and write options in combination      
with each other, or in combination with futures or forward contracts, to        
adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position. For         
example, the fund may purchase a put option and write a call option on the      
same underlying instrument, in order to construct a combined position whose     
risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract.      
Another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at       
one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price, in order to         
reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial        
price increase. Because combined options positions involve multiple trades,     
they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open       
and close out.                                                                  
CORRELATION OF PRICE CHANGES. Because there are a limited number of types       
of exchange-traded options and futures contracts, it is likely that the         
standardized contracts available will not match the fund's current or           
anticipated investments exactly. The fund may invest in options and futures     
contracts based on securities with different issuers, maturities, or other      
characteristics from the securities in which it typically invests, which        
involves a risk that the options or futures position will not track the         
performance of the fund's other investments.                                    
Options and futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their            
underlying instruments, even if the underlying instruments match the fund's     
investments well. Options and futures prices are affected by such factors       
as current and anticipated short-term interest rates, changes in volatility     
of the underlying instrument, and the time remaining until expiration of        
the contract, which may not affect security prices the same way. Imperfect      
correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options      
and futures markets and the securities markets, from structural differences     
in how options and futures and securities are traded, or from imposition of     
daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts. The fund may purchase or       
sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the      
securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to     
compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the           
securities, although this may not be successful in all cases. If price          
changes in the fund's options or futures positions are poorly correlated        
with its other investments, the positions may fail to produce anticipated       
gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other                 
investments.                                                                    
LIQUIDITY OF OPTIONS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS. There is no assurance a liquid      
secondary market will exist for any particular options or futures contract      
at any particular time. Options may have relatively low trading volume and      
liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying                
instrument's current price. In addition, exchanges may establish daily          
price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts, and may halt        
trading if a contract's price moves upward or downward more than the limit      
in a given day. On volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit       
is reached or a trading halt is imposed, it may be impossible for the fund      
to enter into new positions or close out existing positions. If the             
secondary market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation      
limits or otherwise, it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable         
positions, and potentially could require the fund to continue to hold a         
position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value.       
As a result, the fund's access to other assets held to cover its options or     
futures positions could also be impaired.                                       
OTC OPTIONS. Unlike exchange-traded options, which are standardized with        
respect to the underlying instrument, expiration date, contract size and        
strike price, the terms of over-the-counter options (options not traded on      
exchanges) generally are established through negotiation with the other         
party to the option contract. While this type of arrangement allows the         
fund greater flexibility to tailor an option to their needs, OTC options        
generally involve greater credit risk than exchange-traded options, which       
are guaranteed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are     
traded.                                                                         
ASSET COVERAGE FOR FUTURES AND OPTIONS POSITIONS. The fund will comply with     
guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission with           
respect to coverage of options and futures strategies by mutual funds, and      
if the guidelines so require will set aside appropriate liquid assets in a      
segregated custodial account in the amount prescribed. Securities held in a     
segregated account cannot be sold while the futures or option strategy is       
outstanding, unless they are replaced with other suitable assets. As a          
result, there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of        
the fund's assets could impede portfolio management or the fund's ability       
to meet redemption requests or other current obligations.                       
SPECIAL FACTORS AFFECTING ARIZONA                                               
Certain Arizona constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive      
orders, administrative regulations, and voter initiatives, as discussed         
below, could adversely affect the market values and marketability of, or        
result in default of, existing obligations, including obligations that may      
be held by the funds.  Obligations of the state or local governments may        
also be affected by budgetary pressures affecting the State and economic        
conditions in the State. The following highlights only some of the more         
significant financial trends, and is based on information drawn from            
official statements and prospectuses relating to securities offerings of or     
on behalf of the State of Arizona,  its agencies, instrumentalities and         
political subdivisions, and other publicly available documents, as              
available on the date of this Statement of Additional Information.  FMR has     
not independently verified any of the information contained in such             
official statements and other publicly available documents, but is not          
aware of any fact which would render such information inaccurate.               
CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON TAXES,                                            
EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE INCREASES                                              
LIMITATIONS ON TAXES.  Certain obligations held by the funds may be             
obligations of issuers that rely in whole or in part, directly or               
indirectly, on ad valorem property taxes as a source of revenue.  The           
taxing powers of Arizona local governments and districts are limited by         
Arizona Law.  Arizona's property tax system was substantially revised by        
1980 amendments to the Arizona Constitution and implementing legislation.       
There are two separate tax systems: a Primary system for taxes levied to        
pay current operation and maintenance expenses; and a Secondary system for      
taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bonded indebtedness, special      
district assessments and tax overrides. There are specific provisions under     
each system governing property value, the basis of assessment and maximum       
annual tax levies.                                                              
Under the Primary system, property value is the basis for determining           
primary property taxes of locally assessed real property and may increase       
by more than 10% per year only under certain circumstances. Under the           
Secondary system, there is no limitation on annual increases in full cash       
value of any property.                                                          
Under the Primary system, annual tax levies are limited based on the nature     
of the property being taxed, and the nature of the taxing authority.  Taxes     
levied for Primary purposes on residential property only are limited to 1%      
of the full cash value of such property. In addition, taxes levied for          
Primary purposes on all types of property by counties, cities, towns and        
community college districts are limited to a maximum increase of 2% over        
the prior year's levy, plus any amount directly attributable to new             
construction and annexation and involuntary tort judgments.  The 2%             
limitation does not apply to taxes levied for Primary purposes on behalf of     
local school districts. Annual tax levies for bonded indebtedness and           
special district assessments are unlimited under the secondary system.          
EXPENDITURES LIMITS.  Provisions of the Arizona Constitution and Arizona        
legislation limit increases in annual expenditures by counties, cities and      
towns and community college districts and school districts to an amount         
determined by the Arizona Economic Estimates Commission.  This limitation       
is based on the entity's actual expenditures for fiscal year 1979-80, with      
this base adjusted annually to reflect changes in population, cost of           
living and boundaries.                                                          
LIMITATIONS ON REVENUE INCREASES.  In November of 1992 an amendment to the      
Constitution of Arizona was approved by the voters and signed by the            
Governor.  The amendment states that any legislation that provides for a        
net increase in State revenues will be effective only on the affirmative        
vote of two-thirds of the members of each house of the State Legislature,       
and Gubernatorial approval. If the Governor vetoes the measure, then the        
legislation shall not become effective unless the legislation is approved       
by an affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of each house. The       
constitutional amendment does not apply to the effects of inflation,            
increasing assessed valuation or any other similar effect that increases        
State revenue but which is not caused by an affirmative act of the              
Legislature.                                                                    
The enacted fiscal year 1993-94 and 1994-95 budgets did not provide for any     
increases in State revenues that required an approval from two-thirds of        
the State Legislature.                                                          
OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA                                             
Under the Arizona Constitution, the State's power to contract debt is           
limited to an amount of not more than $350,000 to supply casual deficits or     
failures in revenues or to meet expenses not otherwise provided for.  In        
addition to that authority, the State may borrow money to repel invasion,       
suppress insurrection or defend the State in time of war.                       
Certain State agencies and instrumentalities may issue debt secured by          
limited special revenue sources.  Additionally, obligations such as             
lease-purchase agreements and Certificates of Participation that are            
subject to annual appropriation are not debt within the meaning of              
Arizona's constitutional and statutory limitations.  As of June 30, 1993,       
various State agencies, boards, departments and instrumentalities               
(including the Department of Transportation and State educational               
institutions) had approximately $2.087 billion of bonded indebtedness.          
Certificates of Participation of State agencies and instrumentalities           
outstanding at June 30, 1993 totalled approximately $411.4 million.             
ECONOMY                                                                         
Arizona has been, and is projected to continue to be, one of the fastest        
growing areas in the United States.  Over the last several decades the          
State has outpaced most other states in virtually every major category of       
growth, including population, personal income, gross state product and job      
creation.  From 1981 to 1992, the State's population grew 31.13% and is         
currently estimated to be 4 million.                                            
Geographically, Arizona is the nation's sixth largest state. The State is       
divided into fifteen counties.  Two of these counties, Maricopa County          
(including Phoenix) and Pima County (including Tucson), are more urban in       
nature and account for approximately 76% of total population and 82% of         
total wage and salary employment in Arizona. Significant job growth has         
occurred in the areas of aerospace and high technology, construction,           
finance, insurance and real estate. Major employers include Motorola,

RECENT STATE FINANCIAL RESULTS                                                  
REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.  For fiscal year 1993, sales and use taxes and       
other excise taxes accounted for approximately 46% of general fund              
revenues, while income taxes represented approximately 38%, property taxes      
provided approximately 6%, and other taxes represented approximately 10%.       
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, actual State revenues exceeded         
budgeted revenues by more than 5%, while actual expenditures were               
approximately 1% higher than budgeted expenditures, resulting in a fund         
balance of approximately $86 million at year end.                               
Total general fund revenues increased 10.8% from $3.40 billion for the          
fiscal year ended June 30, 1992 to $3.77 billion for the fiscal year ended      
June 30, 1993.  During the same period, the portion of general fund             
revenues derived from taxes increased 10.0%.                                    
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, total general fund expenditures        
were $3.7 billion. These expenditures fell into the following major             
categories:  education (approximately 54%), health and welfare                  
(approximately 29%), protection and safety (approximately 9%), general          
government (approximately 6%) and inspection and regulation, natural            
resources and transportation (approximately 2%).                                
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY.    The State's financial statements are            
currently prepared on a cash basis; however, the State is in the process of     
implementing an accrual basis reporting system, which is required to            
conform with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). It is           
anticipated that the State will begin accrual basis reporting, in addition      
to cash basis reporting, during fiscal year 1994.                               
1993-94 BUDGET.  As of April 1, 1994, the State's general fund revenues for     
fiscal year 1993-94 were projected at $3.75 billion, which is 3.0% more         
than budgeted general fund revenues for fiscal year 1992-93 and 0.5% less       
than the actual general fund revenues collected for fiscal year 1992-93.        
Total general fund expenditures for fiscal year 1993-94 were budgeted at        
$3.8 billion, which is a 1.0% increase over budgeted general fund               
expenditures for fiscal year 1992-93 and a 2.6% increase over the actual        
total general fund expenditures for fiscal year 1992-93.  This would result     
in a budgeted fund balance of approximately $80 million at the 1993-94          
fiscal year end.                                                                
SPENDING DECREASES.  State legislation enacted in connection with the 1994      
budget is expected to cut spending in the following areas:  $94 million in      
Education, $52 million in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System       
(AHCCCS), the State's indigent health care program, and $29 million in          
reduced contributions into the Arizona State Retirement System.                 
REVENUE DECREASES.  The State enacted a series of tax reductions, increases     
in income tax exemptions and deductions that are estimated to reduce            
revenue by a total of $18.7 million.                                            
CERTAIN LITIGATION.  Based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the State     
has determined to refund $197 million, including statutory interest, in         
State income taxes previously collected on Federal retirees pensions.  This     
payment will be made over a four-year period beginning with approximately       
$14.6 million in tax refunds in fiscal year 1993-94.                            
OBLIGATIONS OF OTHER ISSUERS                                                    
ASSESSMENT BONDS. Municipal obligations which are assessment bonds or           
community facilities district bonds may be adversely affected by a general      
decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity.      
In many cases, such bonds are secured by land which is undeveloped at the       
time of issuance but anticipated to be developed within a few years after       
issuance. In the event of such reduction or slowdown, such development may      
not occur or may be delayed, thereby increasing the risk of a default on        
the bonds. The lien on the property is the only security for such bonds.        
LEASE-PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. Certain Arizona lease-purchase obligations,         
though payable from the general fund of the municipality, are subject to        
annual appropriation by the governing body of the municipality in amounts       
sufficient to pay the lease. Nonappropriation is legally not a default and      
there may be no adequate remedies available to the holders of the               
certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event nonappropriation      
occurs.                                                                         
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.  The repayment of mortgage revenue bonds or other         
obligations secured by real property may be affected by laws limiting           
creditors' rights and subject to the exercise of judicial discretion.           
Health care and hospital securities may be affected by changes in State         
regulations governing cost reimbursements to health care providers under        
AHCCCS (the State's indigent health care program).                              
In recent years many cities, towns and counties have experienced declines       
or slowing growth in the Secondary assessed valuation, causing a reduction      
or slower growth in property tax receipts and putting pressure on local         
budgets and capital improvement projects supported by such receipts.            
Municipalities are responding to these developments by a variety of methods     
including increasing the Secondary property tax rate, deferring property        
tax-supported bond projects and using other revenue sources to fund             
projects.                                                                       
Legislation has been or may be introduced which would modify existing taxes     
or other revenue-raising measures. It is not presently possible to predict      
the extent to which any such legislation will be enacted, or if enacted,        
how it would affect Arizona municipal obligations.                              
SPECIAL FACTORS AFFECTING PUERTO RICO                                           
The following only highlights some of the more significant financial trends     
and problems affecting the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Commonwealth"      
or "Puerto Rico"), and is based on information drawn from official              
statements and prospectuses relating to the securities offerings of Puerto      
Rico, its agencies and instrumentalities, as available on the date of this      
Statement of Additional Information. FMR has not independently verified any     
of the information contained in such official statements, prospectuses and      
other publicly available documents, but is not aware of any fact which          
would render such information materially inaccurate.                            
The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked with that of the United            
States, and in fiscal 1992 trade with the United States accounted for           
approximately 88% of Puerto Rico's exports and approximately 68% of its         
imports. In this regard, in fiscal 1992 Puerto Rico experienced a               
$2,940,300,000 positive adjusted merchandise trade balance. Since fiscal        
1987 personal income, both aggregate and per capita, have increased             
consistently each fiscal year. In fiscal 1992 aggregate personal income was     
$22.7 billion and personal per capita income was $6,360. Gross domestic         
product in fiscal 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 was $19,954,000, $21,619,000,       
22,857,000, and $23,620,000, respectively. For fiscal 1993, an increase in      
gross domestic product of 2.9% over fiscal 1992 is forecasted. However,         
actual growth in the Puerto Rico economy will depend on several factors         
including the condition of the U.S. economy, the exchange rate for the U.S.     
dollar, the price stability of oil imports, and interest rates. Due to          
these factors there is no assurance that the economy of Puerto Rico will        
continue to grow.                                                               
Puerto Rico has made marked improvements in fighting unemployment.              
Unemployment is at a low level compared to that of the late 1970s, but it       
still remains significantly above the United States average. Despite long       
term improvements the unemployment rate rose from 15.2% to 16.5% from           
fiscal 1991 to fiscal 1992. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1993      
the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico stood at 17.3%. There is a possibility     
that the unemployment rate will continue to increase.                           
The economy of Puerto Rico has undergone a transformation in the later half     
of this century from one centered around agriculture, to one dominated by       
the manufacturing and service industries. Manufacturing is the cornerstone      
of Puerto Rico's economy, accounting for $13.2 billion or 38.7% of gross        
domestic product in 1992. However, manufacturing has experienced a basic        
change over the years as a result of the influx of higher wage, high            
technology industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, electronics,         
computers, micro-processors, scientific instruments and high technology         
machinery. The service sector, which includes wholesale and retail trade,       
finance and real estate, ranks second in its contribution to gross domestic     
product and is the sector that employs the greatest number of people. In        
fiscal 1992, the service sector generated $13.0 billion in gross domestic       
product or 38.3% of the total and employed over 449,000 workers providing       
46% of total employment. The government sector and tourism also contribute      
to the island economy each accounting for $3.7 billion and $1.5 billion in      
fiscal 1992, respectively.                                                      
Much of the development of the manufacturing sector of the economy of           
Puerto Rico is attributable to federal and Commonwealth tax incentives,         
most notably section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended       
("Section 936") and the Commonwealth's Industrial Incentives Program.           
Section 936 currently grants U.S. corporations that meet certain criteria       
and elect its application a credit against their U.S. corporate income tax      
on the portion of the tax attributable to (i) income derived from the           
active conduct of a trade or business in Puerto Rico ("active income"), or      
from the sale or exchange of substantially all the assets used in the           
active conduct of such trade or business, and (ii) qualified possession         
source investment income ("passive income"). The Industrial Incentives          
Program, through the 1987 Industrial Incentives Act, grants corporations        
engaged in certain qualified activities a fixed 90% exemption from              
Commonwealth income and property taxes and a 60% exemption from municipal       
license taxes.                                                                  
On August 16, 1993, President Clinton signed a bill amending Section 936.       
Under the amendments, U.S. corporations with operations in Puerto Rico can      
elect to receive a federal income tax credit equal to: 40% of the credit        
currently available, phased in over a five year period, starting at 60% of      
the current credit, or a credit based on investment and wages. The              
investment and wage credit would equal the sum of (i) 60% of qualified          
compensation to employees, (ii) a specified percentage of depreciation          
deductions with respect to tangible property located in Puerto Rico, and        
(iii) a portion of income taxed paid to Puerto Rico, up to a 9% effective       
tax rate, subject to certain requirements. It is not possible to determine      
at this time whether the reductions in tax incentives for operations in         
Puerto Rico will have a significant impact on the economy of Puerto Rico or     
the time period in which such impact would arise.                               
PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS                                                          
All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on       
behalf of the funds by FMR (either directly or through affiliated               
sub-advisers) pursuant to authority contained in the management contracts.      
With respect to the money market fund, since FMR has granted investment         
management authority to the sub-adviser (see the section entitled               
"Management Contracts"), the sub-adviser is authorized to place orders for      
the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, and will do so in accordance     
with the policies described below.  FMR is also responsible for the             
placement of transaction orders for other investment companies and accounts     
for which it or its affiliates act as investment adviser. Securities            
purchased and sold by the money market fund generally will be traded on a       
net basis (i.e., without commission). In selecting broker-dealers, subject      
to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws, FMR will consider     
various relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the size and type      
of the transaction; the nature and character of the markets for the             
security to be purchased or sold; the execution efficiency, settlement          
capability, and financial condition of the broker-dealer firm; the              
broker-dealer's execution services rendered on a continuing basis; and the      
reasonableness of any commissions.                                              
The funds may execute portfolio transactions with broker-dealers who            
provide research and execution services to the funds or other accounts over     
which FMR or its affiliates exercise investment discretion. Such services       
may include advice concerning the value of securities; the advisability of      
investing in, purchasing, or selling securities; the availability of            
securities or the purchasers or sellers of securities; furnishing analyses      
and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors        
and trends, portfolio strategy, and performance of accounts; and effecting      
securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto (such       
as clearance and settlement). FMR maintains a listing of broker-dealers who     
provide such services on a regular basis. However, as many transactions on      
behalf of the money market fund are placed with broker-dealers (including       
broker-dealers on the list) without regard to the furnishing of such            
services, it is not possible to estimate the proportion of such                 
transactions directed to such broker-dealers solely because such services       
were provided. The selection of such broker-dealers is generally made by        
FMR (to the extent possible consistent with execution considerations) based     
upon the quality of research and execution services provided.                   
The receipt of research from broker-dealers that execute transactions on        
behalf of the funds may be useful to FMR in rendering investment management     
services to the funds or its other clients, and, conversely, such research      
provided by broker-dealers who have executed transaction orders on behalf       
of other FMR clients may be useful to FMR in carrying out its obligations       
to the funds. The receipt of such research has not reduced FMR's normal         
independent research activities; however, it enables FMR to avoid the           
additional expenses that could be incurred if FMR tried to develop              
comparable information through its own efforts.                                 
Subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws,               
broker-dealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that are in      
excess of the amount of commissions charged by other broker-dealers in          
recognition of their research and execution services. In order to cause a       
fund to pay such higher commissions, FMR must determine in good faith that      
such commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage       
and research services provided by such executing broker-dealers, viewed in      
terms of a particular transaction or FMR's overall responsibilities to the      
funds and its other clients. In reaching this determination, FMR will not       
attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research          
services provided, or to determine what portion of the compensation should      
be related to those services.                                                   
FMR is authorized to use research services provided by and to place             
portfolio transactions with brokerage firms that have provided assistance       
in the distribution of shares of the funds or shares of other Fidelity          
funds to the extent permitted by law. FMR may use research services             
provided by and place agency transactions with Fidelity Brokerage Services,     
Inc. (FBSI), a subsidiary of FMR Corp., if the commissions are fair,            
reasonable, and comparable to commissions charged by non-affiliated,            
qualified brokerage firms for similar services.                                 
Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits members of       
national securities exchanges from executing exchange transactions for          
accounts which they or their affiliates manage, except if certain               
requirements are satisfied. Pursuant to such requirements, the Board of         
Trustees has authorized FBSI to execute fund portfolio transactions on          
national securities exchanges in accordance with approved procedures and        
applicable SEC rules.                                                           
Each fund's Trustees periodically review FMR's performance of its               
responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions     
on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by each fund over         
representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in           
relation to the benefits to the fund.                                           
From time to time the Trustees will review whether the recapture for the        
benefit of the funds of some portion of the brokerage commissions or            
similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally             
permissible and advisable. Each fund seeks to recapture soliciting              
broker-dealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities, but at present no     
other recapture arrangements are in effect. The Trustees intend to continue     
to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally         
permissible and, if so, to determine in the exercise of their business          
judgment whether it would be advisable for each fund to seek such               
recapture.                                                                      
Although the Trustees and officers of the funds are substantially the same      
as those of other funds managed by FMR, investment decisions for each fund      
are made independently from those of other funds managed by FMR or accounts     
managed by FMR affiliates. It sometimes happens that the same security is       
held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or accounts.              
Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and accounts        
are managed by the same investment adviser, particularly when the same          
security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or      
account.                                                                        
When two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale       
of the same security, the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance        
with a formula considered by the officers of the funds involved to be           
equitable to each fund. In some cases, this system could have a detrimental     
effect on the price or value of the security as far as each fund is             
concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the funds to participate     
in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the        
funds. It is the current opinion of the Board of Trustees that the              
desirability of retaining FMR as investment adviser to each fund outweighs      
any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous       
transactions.                                                                   
VALUATION OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES                                               
INCOME FUND. Valuations of portfolio securities furnished by the pricing        
service employed by the fund are based upon a computerized matrix system or     
appraisals by the pricing service, in each case in reliance upon                
information concerning market transactions and quotations from recognized       
municipal securities dealers. The methods used by the pricing service and       
the quality of valuations so established are reviewed by officers of the        
fund and FSC under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. There      
are a number of pricing services available, and the Trustees, or officers       
acting on behalf of the Trustees, on the basis of on-going evaluation of        
these services, may use other pricing services or discontinue the use of        
any pricing service in whole or in part.                                        
MONEY MARKET FUND. The money market fund values its investments on the          
basis of amortized cost. This technique involves valuing an instrument at       
its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount       
rather than its value based on current market quotations or appropriate         
substitutes which reflect current market conditions. The amortized cost         
value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price the fund would     
receive if it sold the instrument.                                              
Valuing the money market fund's instruments on the basis of amortized cost      
and use of the term "money market fund" are permitted by Rule 2a-7 under        
the 1940 Act. The fund must adhere to certain conditions under Rule 2a-7.       
The Board of Trustees of the fund oversees FMR's adherence to SEC rules         
concerning money market funds, and has established procedures designed to       
stabilize the fund's NAV at $1.00. At such intervals as they deem               
appropriate, the Trustees consider the extent to which NAV calculated by        
using market valuations would deviate from $1.00 per share. If the Trustees     
believe that a deviation from the fund's amortized cost per share may           
result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders, the        
Trustees have agreed to take such corrective action, if any, as they deem       
appropriate to eliminate or reduce, to the extent reasonably practicable,       
the dilution or unfair results. Such corrective action could include            
selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or     
losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity; withholding dividends;         
redeeming shares in kind; establishing NAV by using available market            
quotations; and such other measures as the Trustees may deem appropriate.       
During periods of declining interest rates, the money market fund's yield       
based on amortized cost may be higher than the yield based on market            
valuations. Under these circumstances, a shareholder in the fund would be       
able to obtain a somewhat higher yield than would result if the fund            
utilized market valuations to determine its NAV. The converse would apply       
in a period of rising interest rates.                                           
PERFORMANCE                                                                     
The funds may quote performance in various ways. All performance                
information supplied by the funds in advertising is historical and is not       
intended to indicate future returns. The income fund's share price, and         
each fund's yields and total returns fluctuate in response to market            
conditions and other factors, and the value of the income fund's shares         
when redeemed may be more or less than their original cost.                     
YIELD CALCULATIONS. To compute the money market fund's yield for a period,      
the net change in value of a hypothetical account containing one share          
reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the       
one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and        
any additional shares. The net change is then divided by the value of the       
account at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return. This     
base period return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield. The      
money market fund also may calculate a compound effective yield by              
compounding the base period return over a one-year period. In addition to       
the current yield, the money market fund may quote yields in advertising        
based on any historical seven-day period.  Yields for the money market fund     
are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds, as required       
by regulation.                                                                  
For the income fund, yields used in advertising are computed by dividing        
the fund's interest income for a given 30-day or one-month period, net of       
expenses, by the average number of shares entitled to receive dividends         
during the period, dividing this figure by the fund's net asset value per       
share at the end of the period, and annualizing the result (assuming            
compounding of income) in order to arrive at an annual percentage rate.         
Yields do not reflect the fund's .50% redemption fee, which applies to          
shares held less than 180 days. Income is calculated for purposes of the        
fund's yield quotations in accordance with standardized methods applicable      
to all stock and bond funds. In general, interest income is reduced with        
respect to bonds trading at a premium over their par value by subtracting a     
portion of the premium from income on a daily basis, and is increased with      
respect to bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion of the discount      
to daily income. Capital gains and losses generally are excluded from the       
calculation.                                                                    
Income calculated for the purposes of calculating the income fund's yield       
differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes. Because of     
the different accounting methods used, and because of the compounding of        
income assumed in yield calculations, the income fund's yield may not equal     
its distribution rate, the income paid to your account, or the income           
reported in the fund's financial statements.                                    
A fund's tax-equivalent yield is the rate an investor would have to earn        
from a fully taxable investment after taxes to equal the fund's tax-free        
yield. Tax-equivalent yields are calculated by dividing a fund's yield by       
the result of one minus a stated federal or combined federal and state tax      
rate. If only a portion of the fund's yield is tax-exempt, only that            
portion is adjusted in the calculation.                                         
The following tables show the effect of a shareholder's tax status on the       
effective yield under federal and state income tax laws for 1994. They show     
the approximate yield a taxable security must provide at various income         
brackets to produce after-tax yields equivalent to those of tax-exempt          
obligations yielding from 2% to 7%. Of course, no assurance can be given        
that the funds will achieve any specific tax-exempt yield. While the funds      
invest principally in obligations whose interest is exempt from federal and     
state income tax, other income received by the funds may be taxable. The        
funds do not take into account local taxes, if any, payable on fund             
distributions.                                                                  
Use the first table to find your approximate effective tax bracket taking

Each fund may invest a portion of its assets in obligations that are            
subject to state or federal income taxes. When the fund invests in these        
obligations, its tax-equivalent yields will be lower. In the table above,       
tax-equivalent yields are calculated assuming investments are 100%              
federally and state tax-free.                                                   
TOTAL RETURN CALCULATIONS. Total returns quoted in advertising reflect all      
aspects of a fund's returns, including the effect of reinvesting dividends      
and capital gain distributions, and any change in the fund's NAV over a         
stated period. Average annual total returns are calculated by determining       
the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in a     
fund over a stated period, and then calculating the annually compounded         
percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of         
growth or decline in value had been constant over the period. For example,      
a cumulative total return of 100% over ten years would produce an average       
annual return of 7.18%, which is the steady annual rate that would equal        
100% growth on a compounded basis in ten years.  Average annual returns         
covering periods less than one year are calculated by determining a fund's      
total return for the period, extending that return for a full year              
(assuming that return remains constant over the year), and quoting the          
result as an annual return.  While average annual returns are a convenient      
means of comparing investment alternatives, investors should realize that a     
fund's performance is not constant over time, but changes from year to          
year, and that average annual total returns represent averaged figures as       
opposed to the actual year-to-year performance of the fund.                     
In addition to average annual returns, a fund may quote unaveraged or           
cumulative total returns reflecting the simple change in value of an            
investment over a stated period. Average annual and cumulative total            
returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount, and may be         
calculated for a single investment, a series of investments, or a series of     
redemptions, over any time period. Total returns may be broken down into        
their components of income and capital (including capital gains and changes     
in share price) in order to illustrate the relationship of these factors        
and their contributions to total return.  Total returns may be quoted on a      
before-tax or after-tax basis, and may or may not include the income fund's     
.50% redemption fee on shares held less than 180 days.  Excluding the           
redemption fee from a total return calculation produces a higher total          
return figure.  Omitting fees and charges will cause the funds' total           
return figures to be higher.  Total returns, yields, and other performance      
information may be quoted numerically or in a table, graph, or similar          
illustration, and may omit or include the effects of each fund's $5.00          
account closeout fee.                                                           
NET ASSET VALUE. Charts and graphs using a fund's net asset value, adjusted     
net asset values, and benchmark indices may be used to exhibit performance.     
An adjusted NAV includes any distributions paid by a fund and reflects all      
elements of its return. Unless otherwise indicated, a fund's adjusted NAVs      
are not adjusted for sales charges, if any.                                     
Each fund may compare its return to the record of the Standard &amp; Poor's     
500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&amp;P 500(Registered trademark)), the        
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and the cost of living (measured by        
the Consumer Price Index, or CPI) over the same period. The S&amp;P 500 and     
DJIA comparisons would show how each fund's total return compared to the        
record of a broad average of common stocks and a narrower set of stocks of      
major industrial companies, respectively, over the same period.  Of course,     
since the income fund invests in fixed-income securities, and the money         
market fund invests in short-term fixed-income securities, common stocks        
represent a different type of investment from the fund.  Common stocks          
generally offer greater growth potential than the fund, but generally           
experience greater price volatility, which means greater potential for          
loss.  In addition, common stocks generally provide lower income than a         
fixed-income investment such as the funds.  Figures for the S&amp;P 500 and     
DJIA are based on the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and, unlike the      
fund's returns, their returns do not include the effect of paying brokerage     
commissions or other costs of investing.                                        
A fund's performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual         
funds in general, or to the performance of particular types of mutual           
funds.   These comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings             
prepared by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. (Lipper), an independent           
service located in Summit, New Jersey that monitors the performance of          
mutual funds.  Lipper generally ranks funds on the basis of total return,       
assuming reinvestment of distributions, but does not take sales charges or      
redemption fees into consideration, and is prepared without regard to tax       
consequences.  Lipper may also rank funds based on yield.  In addition to       
the mutual fund rankings, a fund's performance may be compared to stock,        
bond, and money market mutual fund performance indices prepared by Lipper       
or other organizations. When comparing these indices, it is important to        
remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment.        
For example, while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns,       
they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility. Likewise,         
money market funds may offer greater stability of principal, but generally      
do not offer the higher potential returns from stock mutual funds.              
From time to time, a fund's performance may also be compared to other           
mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals.     
For example, the fund may quote Morningstar, Inc. in its advertising            
materials. Morningstar, Inc. is a mutual fund rating service that rates         
mutual funds on the basis of risk-adjusted performance. Rankings that           
compare the performance of Fidelity funds to one another in appropriate         
categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising.     
A fund may be compared in advertising to Certificates of Deposit (CDs) or       
other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions. Mutual      
funds differ from bank investments in several respects. For example, a fund     
may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than CDs, the fund      
does not guarantee your principal or your return, and fund shares are  not      
FDIC insured.                                                                   
Fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand        
their investment goals and explore various financial strategies.  Such          
information may include materials that describe general principles of           
investing, such as asset allocation, diversification, risk tolerance, and       
goal setting; questionnaires designed to help create a personal financial       
profile; a worksheet used to project savings needs based on assumed rates       
of inflation and hypothetical rates of return; and action plans offering        
investment alternatives.  Materials may also include discussions of             
Fidelity's asset allocation funds and other Fidelity funds, products, and       
services.                                                                       
Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois (Ibbotson) provides historical         
returns of the capital markets in the United States, including common           
stocks, small capitalization stocks, long-term corporate bonds,                 
intermediate-term government bonds, long-term government bonds, Treasury        
bills, the U.S. rate of inflation (based on the CPI), and combinations of       
various capital markets. The performance of these capital markets is based      
on the returns of different indices.                                            
Fidelity funds may use the performance of these capital markets in order to     
demonstrate general risk-versus-reward investment scenarios. Performance        
comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment in any      
of these capital markets. The risks associated with the security types in       
any capital market may or may not correspond directly to those of the           
funds. Ibbotson calculates total returns in the same method as the funds.       
The funds may also compare performance to that of other compilations or         
indices that may be developed and made available in the future.                 
A fund may compare its performance or the performance of securities in          
which it may invest to averages published by IBC USA (Publications), Inc.

REPORT(trademark), covers over ___ tax-free bond funds. When evaluating         
comparisons to money market funds, investors should consider the relevant       
differences in investment objectives and policies. Specifically, money          
market funds invest in short-term, high-quality instruments and seek to         
maintain a stable $1.00 share price. The income fund, however, invests in       
longer-term instruments and its share price changes daily in response to a      
variety of factors.                                                             
The income fund may compare and contrast in advertising the relative            
advantages of investing in a mutual fund versus an individual municipal         
bond. Unlike tax-free mutual funds, individual municipal bonds offer a          
stated rate of interest and, if held to maturity, repayment of principal.       
Although some individual municipal bonds might offer a higher return, they      
do not offer the reduced risk of a mutual fund that invests in many             
different securities. The initial investment requirements and sales charges     
of many tax-free mutual funds are lower than the purchase cost of               
individual municipal bonds, which are generally issued in $5,000                
denominations and are subject to direct brokerage costs.                        
In advertising materials, Fidelity may reference or discuss its products        
and services, which may include: other Fidelity funds; retirement               
investing; brokerage products and services; the effects of periodic             
investment plans and dollar cost averaging; saving for college; charitable      
giving; and the Fidelity credit card.  In addition, Fidelity may quote or       
reprint financial or business publications and periodicals, including model     
portfolios or allocations, as they relate to fund management, portfolio         
composition, investment philosophy, investment techniques, the desirability     
of owning a particular mutual fund, and Fidelity services and products.         
Fidelity may also reprint, and use as advertising and sales literature,         
articles from Fidelity Focus, a quarterly magazine provided free of charge      
to Fidelity fund shareholders.                                                  
A fund may present its fund number, Quotron(trademark) number, and CUSIP        
number, and discuss or quote its current portfolio manager.                     
VOLATILITY.  The income fund may quote various measures of volatility and       
benchmark correlation in advertising.  In addition, the fund may compare        
these measures to those of other funds.  Measures of volatility seek to         
compare the fund's historical share price fluctuations or total returns to      
those of a benchmark.  Measures of benchmark correlation indicate how valid     
a comparative benchmark may be.  All measures of volatility and correlation     
are calculated using averages of historical data. In advertising, a fund        
may also discuss or illustrate examples of interest rate sensitivity.           
MOMENTUM INDICATORS indicate a fund's price movements over specific periods     
of time.  Each point on the momentum indicator represents the fund's            
percentage change in price movements over that period.                          
The income fund may advertise examples of the effects of periodic               
investment plans, including the principle of dollar cost averaging. In such     
a program, an investor invests a fixed dollar amount in a fund at periodic      
intervals, thereby purchasing fewer shares when prices are high and more        
shares when prices are low. While such a strategy does not assure a profit      
or guard against loss in a declining market, the investor's average cost        
per share can be lower than if fixed numbers of shares are purchased at the     
same intervals. In evaluating such a plan, investors should consider their      
ability to continue purchasing shares during periods of low price levels.       
As of August 31, 1994, FMR advised over $__ billion in tax-free fund            
assets, $__ billion in money market fund assets, $___ billion in equity         
fund assets, $__ billion in international fund assets, and $___ billion in      
Spartan fund assets.  The funds may reference the growth and variety of         
money market mutual funds and the adviser's innovation and participation in     
the industry.  The equity funds under management figure represents the          
largest amount of equity fund assets under management by a mutual fund          
investment adviser in the United States, making FMR America's leading           
equity (stock) fund manager.  FMR, its subsidiaries, and affiliates             
maintain a worldwide information and communications network for the purpose     
of researching and managing investments abroad, with over __ employees in       
over __ foreign countries.                                                      
In addition to performance rankings, each fund may compare its total            
expense ratio to the average total expense ratio of similar funds tracked       
by Lipper. A fund's total expense ratio is a significant factor in              
comparing bond and money market investments because of its effect on yield.     

ADDITIONAL PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION INFORMATION                                  
Each fund is open for business and its net asset value per share (NAV) is       
calculated each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open for trading.     
The NYSE has designated the following holiday closings for 1994:                
Washington's Birthday (observed), Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed),         
Independence Day (observed), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day     
(observed). Although FMR expects the same holiday schedule, with the            
addition of New Year's Day, to be observed in the future, the NYSE may          
modify its holiday schedule at any time.                                        
FSC normally determines each fund's NAV as of the close of the NYSE             
(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time). However, NAV may be calculated earlier       
if trading on the NYSE is restricted or as permitted by the SEC. To the         
extent that portfolio securities are traded in other markets on days when       
the NYSE is closed, a fund's NAV may be affected on days when investors do      
not have access to the fund to purchase or redeem shares. In addition,          
trading in some of a fund's portfolio securities may not occur on days when     
the fund is open for business.                                                  
If the Trustees determine that existing conditions make cash payments           
undesirable, redemption payments may be made in whole or in part in             
securities or other property, valued for this purpose as they are valued in     
computing a fund's NAV. Shareholders receiving securities or other property     
on redemption may realize a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will incur       
any costs of sale, as well as the associated inconveniences.                    
Pursuant to Rule 11a-3 under the 1940 Act, each fund is required to give        
shareholders at least 60 days' notice prior to terminating or modifying its     
exchange privilege. Under the Rule, the 60-day notification requirement may     
be waived if (i) the only effect of a modification would be to reduce or        
eliminate an administrative fee, redemption fee, or deferred sales charge       
ordinarily payable at the time of an exchange, or (ii) the fund suspends        
the redemption of the shares to be exchanged as permitted under the 1940        
Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, or the fund to be acquired         
suspends the sale of its shares because it is unable to invest amounts          
effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies.           
In the Prospectus, each fund has notified shareholders that it reserves the     
right at any time, without prior notice, to refuse exchange purchases by        
any person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund would be unable to          
invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective and              
policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.                 
DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                                         
DISTRIBUTIONS. If you request to have distributions mailed to you and the       
U.S. Postal Service cannot deliver your checks, or if your checks remain        
uncashed for six months, Fidelity may reinvest your distributions at the        
then-current NAV. All subsequent distributions will then be reinvested          
until you provide Fidelity with alternate instructions.                         
DIVIDENDS. To the extent that each fund's income is derived from federally      
tax-exempt interest, the daily dividends declared by each fund are also         
federally tax-exempt. The funds will send each shareholder a notice in          
January describing the tax status of dividends and capital gain                 
distributions (if any) for the prior year.                                      
Shareholders are required to report tax-exempt income on their federal tax      
returns. Shareholders who earn other income, such as social security            
benefits, may be subject to federal income tax on up to one half of such        
benefits to the extent that their income, including tax-exempt income,          
exceeds certain base amounts.                                                   
The funds purchase municipal obligations based on opinions of bond counsel      
regarding the federal income tax status of the obligations. These opinions      
generally will be based upon covenants by the issuers regarding continuing      
compliance with federal tax requirements. If the issuer of an obligation        
fails to comply with its covenants at any time, interest on the obligation      
could become federally taxable retroactive to the date the obligation was       
issued.                                                                         
As a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, interest on certain "private         
activity" securities (referred to as "qualified bonds" in the Internal          
Revenue Code) is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT),          
although the interest continues to be excludable from gross income for          
other purposes.  Interest from private activity securities will be              
considered tax-exempt for purposes of each fund's policy of investing so        
that at least 80% of its assets are in municipal securities whose interest      
is free from federal income tax. Interest from private activity securities      
is a tax preference item for the purposes of determining whether a taxpayer     
is subject to the AMT and the amount of AMT tax to be paid, if any. Private     
activity securities issued after August 7, 1986 to benefit a private or         
industrial user or to finance a private facility are affected by this rule.     
Corporate investors should note that an adjustment for purposes of the          
corporate AMT is 75% of the amount by which adjusted current earnings           
(which includes tax-exempt interest) exceeds alternative minimum taxable        
income of the corporation.                                                      
If a shareholder receives an exempt-interest dividend and sells shares at a     
loss after holding them for a period of six months or less, the loss will       
be disallowed to the extent of the amount of exempt-interest dividend.          
CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS. Long-term capital gains earned by the income        
fund on the sale of securities and distributed to shareholders are              
federally taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of the length of       
time that shareholders have held their shares. If a shareholder receives a      
long-term capital gain distribution on shares of the fund and such shares       
are held six months or less and are sold at a loss, the portion of the loss     
equal to the amount of the long-term capital gain distribution will be          
considered a long-term loss for tax purposes.                                   
A portion of the gain on bonds purchased at a discount after April 30, 1993     
and short-term capital gains distributed by the funds are federally taxable     
to shareholders as dividends, not as capital gains. Distributions from          
short-term capital gains do not qualify for the dividends-received              
deduction. Dividend distributions resulting from a recharacterization of        
gain from the sale of bonds purchased at a discount after April 30, 1993        
are not considered income for purposes of the funds' policy of investing so     
that at least 80% of their assets are in municipal securities whose             
interest is free from federal income tax. The money market fund may             
distribute any net realized short-term capital gains once a year or more        
often as necessary to maintain its net asset value at $1.00 a share.            
TAX STATUS OF THE FUNDS. Each fund has qualified and intends to continue to     
qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" for tax purposes so       
that it will not be liable for federal tax on income and capital gains          
distributed to shareholders. In order to qualify as a regulated investment      
company and avoid being subject to federal income or excise taxes at the        
fund level, each fund intends to distribute all of its net investment           
income and net realized capital gains (if any) within each calendar year as     
well as on a fiscal year basis. Each fund intends to comply with other tax      
rules applicable to regulated investment companies, including a requirement     
that capital gains from the sale of securities held less than three months      
constitute less than 30% of the fund's gross income for each fiscal year.       
Gains from some futures contracts and options are included in this 30%          
calculation, which may limit the income fund's investments in such              
instruments. Each fund is treated as a separate entity from the other funds     
of Fidelity Union Street Trust and Fidelity Union Street Trust II for tax       
purposes.                                                                       
ARIZONA TAX MATTERS. The Arizona Department of Revenue has ruled that           
dividends paid by a regulated investment company are exempt from Arizona        
state income tax to the extent such dividends are derived from interest on      
obligations the interest on which is exempt from Arizona state income tax.      
For purposes of Arizona income taxation, distributions derived from             
interest on other types of obligations (i.e., obligations the interest on       
which is not exempt from Arizona state income tax) will be taxable as           
ordinary income, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares.       
Distributions of net capital gains (both short- and long-term net capital       
gains) are not exempt from Arizona income taxation and are taxed at             
ordinary income tax rates.  Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued      
by a shareholder in connection with the purchase of shares of a fund will       
not be deductible for Arizona personal income tax purposes.                     
OTHER TAX INFORMATION. The information above is only a summary of some of       
the tax consequences generally affecting the funds and their shareholders,      
and no attempt has been made to discuss individual tax consequences.            
Investors should consult their tax advisers to determine whether the funds      
are suitable to their particular tax situations.                                
FMR

in 1972. At present, the principal operating activities of FMR Corp. are        
those conducted by three of its divisions as follows: FSC, which is the         
transfer and shareholder servicing agent for certain of the funds advised       
by FMR; Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, which

lifetime from the fund based on their  basic trustee fees and length of         
service.  Currently, Messrs. Robert L. Johnson, William R. Spaulding,           
Bertram H. Witham, and David L. Yunich participate in the program.              
As of this Statement of Additional Information, FMR owns a majority of the      
outstanding shares of each fund.                                                
MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS 
Each fund employs FMR to furnish investment advisory and other services.        
Under its management contract with each fund, FMR acts as investment            
adviser and, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, directs       
the investments of the fund in accordance with its investment objective,        
policies, and limitations. FMR also provides the funds with all necessary       
office facilities and personnel for servicing the funds' investments, and       
compensates all officers of the trust, all Trustees who are "interested         
persons" of the trust or of FMR, and all personnel of the trust or FMR          
performing services relating to research, statistical, and investment           
activities.                                                                     
In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Board     
of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services necessary       
for the operation of each fund. These services include providing facilities     
for maintaining the fund's organization; supervising relations with             
custodians, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, underwriters, and         
other persons dealing with the fund; preparing all general shareholder          
communications and conducting shareholder relations; maintaining the fund's     
records and the registration of the fund's shares under federal and state       
law; developing management and shareholder services for the fund; and           
furnishing reports, evaluations, and analyses on a variety of subjects to       
the Board of Trustees.                                                          
FMR is responsible for the payment of all expenses of the funds with            
certain exceptions. Specific expenses payable by FMR include, without           
limitation, the fees and expenses of registering and qualifying the funds       
and their shares for distribution under federal and state securities laws;      
expenses of typesetting for printing the Prospectus and Statement of            
Additional Information; custodian charges; audit and legal expenses;            
insurance expense; association membership dues; and the expenses of mailing     
reports to shareholders, shareholder meetings, and proxy solicitations. FMR     
also provides for transfer agent and dividend disbursing services and           
portfolio and general accounting record maintenance through FSC.                
FMR pays all other expenses of each fund with the following exceptions:         
fees and expenses of all Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the       
trust or FMR (the non-interested Trustees); interest on borrowings; taxes;      
brokerage commissions (if any); and such nonrecurring expenses as may           
arise, including costs of any litigation to which the funds may be a party,     
and any obligation they may have to indemnify the officers and Trustees         
with respect to litigation.                                                     
FMR is each fund's manager pursuant to management contracts dated July _,       
1994, which were approved by FMR, than sole shareholder of each fund, on        
July _, 1994.  For the services of FMR under the contracts, the money           
market fund and the income fund pay FMR a monthly management fee at the         
annual rate of .50% and .55%, respectively, of average net assets               
throughout the month. FMR reduces its fee by an amount equal to the fees        
and expenses of the non-interested Trustees.                                    
FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of a         
fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes, brokerage              
commissions, and extraordinary expenses).  To defray shareholder service        
costs, FMR or its affiliates also collect each fund's $5.00 exchange fee,       
$5.00 account closeout fee, $5.00 fees for for wire purchases and               
redemptions, and the money market fund's $2.00 checkwriting charge.             
SUB-ADVISER. With respect to the money market fund, FMR has entered into a      
sub-advisory agreement with FMR Texas pursuant to which FMR Texas has           
primary responsibility for providing portfolio investment management            
services to the fund. Under the sub-advisory agreement, FMR pays FMR Texas      
a fee equal to 50% of the management fee payable to FMR under its current       
management contract with the fund. The fees paid to FMR Texas are not           
reduced by any voluntary or mandatory expense reimbursements that may be in     
effect from time to time.                                                       
DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLANS                                                  
Each fund has adopted a distribution and service plan (the plan) under Rule     
12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Rule). The Rule provides       
in substance that a mutual fund may not engage directly or indirectly in        
financing any activity that is primarily intended to result in the sale of      
shares of the fund except pursuant to a plan adopted by the fund under the      
Rule. Each fund's Board of Trustees has adopted the plan to allow the fund      
and FMR to incur certain expenses that might be considered to constitute        
indirect payment by the fund of distribution expenses. Under the plan, if       
the payment of management fees by the fund to FMR  is deemed to be indirect     
financing by the fund of the distribution of its shares, such payment is        
authorized by the plan.                                                         
Each plan specifically recognizes that FMR, either directly or through FDC,     
may use its management fee revenues, past profits, or other resources,          
without limitation, to pay promotional and administrative expenses in           
connection with the offer and sale of shares of the fund. In addition, each     
plan provides that FMR may use its resources, including its management fee      
revenues, to make payments to third parties that provide assistance in          
selling shares of the fund, or to third parties, including banks, that          
render shareholder support services. The Trustees have not authorized such      
payments to date.                                                               
Each fund's plan has been approved by the Trustees. As required by the          
Rule, the Trustees carefully considered all pertinent factors relating to       
implementation of each plan prior to its approval, and have determined that     
there is a reasonable likelihood that the plan will benefit the fund and        
its shareholders. In particular, the Trustees noted that each plan does not     
authorize payments by the fund other than those made to FMR under its           
management contract with the fund. To the extent that each plan gives FMR       
and FDC greater flexibility in connection with the distribution of shares       
of the fund, additional sales of the fund's shares may result.                  
Additionally, certain shareholder support services may be provided more         
effectively under each plan by local entities with whom shareholders have       
other relationships.                                                            
Each plan was approved by FMR, as the sole shareholder of each fund, on         
_______, 1994.                                                                  
The Glass-Steagall Act generally prohibits federally and state chartered or     
supervised banks from engaging in the business of underwriting, selling, or     
distributing securities. Although the scope of this prohibition under the       
Glass-Steagall Act has not been clearly defined by the courts or                
appropriate regulatory agencies, FDC believes that the Glass-Steagall Act       
should not preclude a bank from performing shareholder support services, or     
servicing and recordkeeping functions. FDC intends to engage banks only to      
perform such functions. However, changes in federal or state statutes and       
regulations pertaining to the permissible activities of banks and their         
affiliates or subsidiaries, as well as further judicial or administrative       
decisions or interpretations, could prevent a bank from continuing to           
perform all or a part of the contemplated services. If a bank were              
prohibited from so acting, the Trustees would consider what actions, if         
any, would be necessary to continue to provide efficient and effective          
shareholder services. In such event, changes in the operation of the funds      
might occur, including possible termination of any automatic investment or      
redemption or other services then provided by the bank. It is not expected      
that shareholders would suffer any adverse financial consequences as a          
result of any of these occurrences.                                             
Each fund may execute portfolio transactions with and purchase securities       
issued by depository institutions that receive payments under the plan. No      
preference for the instruments of such depository institutions will be          
shown in the selection of investments. In addition, state securities laws       
on this issue may differ from the interpretations of federal law expressed      
herein, and banks and other financial institutions may be required to           
register as dealers pursuant to state law.                                      
INTEREST OF FMR AFFILIATES                                                      
United Missouri is each fund's custodian and transfer agent. United             
Missouri has entered into sub-contracts with FSC, an affiliate of FMR,          
under the terms of which FSC performs the processing activities associated      
with providing transfer agent and shareholder servicing functions for each      
fund. United Missouri has additional sub-contracts with FSC pursuant to         
which FSC performs the calculations necessary to determine each fund's net      
asset value per share and dividends and maintains the funds' accounting         
records. United Missouri is entitled to reimbursement for fees paid to FSC      
from FMR, who must bear these costs pursuant to its management contract         
with each fund.                                                                 
Each fund has a distribution agreement with FDC, a Massachusetts                
corporation organized on July 18, 1960. FDC is a broker-dealer registered       
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National       
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The distribution agreement calls        
for FDC to use all reasonable efforts, consistent with its other business,      
to secure purchasers for shares of each fund, which are continuously            
offered at net asset value. Promotional and administrative expenses in          
connection with the offer and sale of shares are paid by FMR.                   
DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUSTS                                                       
TRUSTS' ORGANIZATION. Fidelity Union Street Trust (the Massachusetts trust)     
is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts       
business trust on March 1, 1974.  On April 30, 1990, the Board of Trustees      
voted to change the name of the trust from Fidelity Daily Income Trust to       
Fidelity Union Street Trust.  Currently, there are eight funds of the           
Massachusetts trust: Fidelity Export Company Fund, Spartan Aggressive           
Municipal Fund, Spartan Ginnie Mae Fund, Spartan Intermediate Municipal         
Fund, Spartan Maryland Municipal Income Fund, Spartan Municipal Income          
Portfolio, Spartan Short-Intermediate Municipal Fund, and Spartan Arizona       
Municipal Income Portfolio.  The Massachusetts trust's Declaration of Trust     
permits the Trustees to create additional funds.                                
Fidelity Union Street Trust II (the Delaware trust) is an open-end              
management investment company organized as a Delaware Business trust on         
June 20, 1991. Currently, there four funds of the Delaware trust: Fidelity      
Daily Income Trust, Spartan Municipal Money Fund, Spartan World Money           
Market Fund, and Spartan Arizona Municipal Money Market Portfolio. The          
Delaware trust's Trust Instrument permits the Trustees to create additional     
funds.                                                                          
In the event that FMR ceases to be investment adviser to a trust or any of      
its funds, the right of the trust or the fund to use the identifying names      
"Fidelity" and "Spartan" may be withdrawn. There is a remote possibility        
that one fund might become liable for any misstatement in its prospectus or     
statement of additional information about another fund.                         
The assets of each trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each       
of its funds and all income, earnings, profits and proceeds thereof,            
subject only to the rights of creditors, are especially allocated to such       
fund, and constitute the underlying assets of such fund. The underlying         
assets of each fund are segregated on the books of account, and are to be       
charged with the liabilities with respect to such fund and with a share of      
the general liabilities of their respective trusts. Expenses with respect       
to each trust are to be allocated in proportion to the asset value of their     
respective funds, except where allocations of direct expense can otherwise      
be fairly made. The officers of the trusts, subject to the general              
supervision of the Board of Trustees, have the power to determine which         
expenses are allocable to a given fund, or which are general or allocable       
to all of the funds of a certain trust. In the event of the dissolution or      
liquidation of a trust, shareholders of each fund of that trust are             
entitled to receive as a class the underlying assets of such fund available     
for distribution.                                                               
SHAREHOLDER AND TRUSTEE LIABILITY - MASSACHUSETTS TRUST. The Massachusetts      
trust is an entity of the type commonly known as a "Massachusetts business      
trust." Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of such a trust may, under        
certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of the     
trust. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Massachusetts Trust shall     
not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the           
purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement, obligation, or       
instrument entered into or executed by the trust or its Trustees shall          
include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the             
Massachusetts Trust and its assets. The Declaration of Trust provides for       
indemnification out of each fund's property of any shareholders held            
personally liable for the obligations of the fund. The Declaration of Trust     
also provides that each fund shall, upon request, assume the defense of any     
claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund        
and satisfy any judgment thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring     
financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to                
circumstances in which the fund itself would be unable to meet its              
obligations. FMR believes that, in view of the above, the risk of personal      
liability to shareholders is remote.                                            
The Declaration of Trust further provides that the Trustees, if they have       
exercised reasonable care, will not be liable for any neglect or                
wrongdoing, but nothing in the Declaration of Trust protects Trustees           
against any liability to which they would otherwise be subject by reason of     
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of      
the duties involved in the conduct of their office.                             
SHAREHOLDER AND TRUSTEE LIABILITY - DELAWARE TRUST. The Delaware Trust is a     
business trust organized under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that         
shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitations of personal              
liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit. The      
courts of some states, however, may decline to apply Delaware law on this       
point. The Trust Instrument contains an express disclaimer of shareholder       
liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses of the          
Delaware Trust and requires that a disclaimer be given in each contract         
entered into or executed by the Delaware Trust or its Trustees. The Trust       
Instrument provides for indemnification out of each fund's property of any      
shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the                
obligations of the fund. The Trust Instrument also provides that each fund      
shall, upon request, assume the defense of any claim made against any           
shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment      
thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on            
account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which           
Delaware law does not apply, no contractual limitation of liability was in      
effect, and the fund is unable to meet its obligations. FMR believes that,      
in view of the above, the risk of personal liability to shareholders is         
extremely remote.                                                               
The Trust Instrument further provides that the Trustees shall not be            
personally liable to any person other than the Delaware Trust or its            
shareholders; moreover, the Trustees shall not be liable for any conduct        
whatsoever, provided that Trustees are not protected against any liability      
to which they would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,      
bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved       
in the conduct of their office.                                                 
VOTING RIGHTS - BOTH TRUSTS. Each fund's capital consists of shares of          
beneficial interest.  As a shareholder of the Massachusetts trust, you          
receive one vote for each dollar value of net asset value per share you         
own. The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights; voting and             
dividend rights, the right of redemption, and the privilege of exchange are     
described in the Prospectus. Shares are fully paid and nonassessable,           
except as set forth under the respective "Shareholder and Trustee               
Liability" headings above. Shareholders representing 10% or more of a trust     
or one of its funds may, as set forth in the Declaration of Trust or Trust      
Instrument, call meetings of the trust or fund for any purpose related to       
the trust or fund, as the case may be, including, in the case of a meeting      
of an entire trust, the purpose on voting on removal of one or more             
Trustees.                                                                       
A trust or any fund may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to (or,       
in the case of the Delaware Trust and its funds, merger with) another           
open-end management investment company or series thereof, or upon               
liquidation and distribution of its assets. Generally such terminations         
must be approved by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding        
shares of the trust or the fund (for the Delaware Trust), or by a vote of       
the holders of a majority of the trust or fund, as determined by the            
current value of each shareholder's investment in the trust or fund (for        
the Massachusetts Trust); however, the Trustees of the Delaware Trust may,      
without prior shareholder approval, change the form of the organization of      
the Delaware Trust by merger, consolidation, or incorporation. If not so        
terminated or reorganized, the trusts and their funds will continue             
indefinitely.                                                                   
Under the Trust Instrument, the Trustees may, without shareholder vote,         
cause the Delaware Trust to merge or consolidate into one or more trusts,       
partnerships, or corporations, so long as the surviving entity is an            
open-end management investment company that will succeed to or assume the       
Delaware Trust registration statement, or cause the Delaware Trust to be        
incorporated under Delaware law.                                                
Each fund of the Massachusetts and Delaware business trusts may also invest     
all of its assets in another investment company.                                
CUSTODIAN. United Missouri Bank, N.A., 1010 Grand Avenue, Kansas City,          
Missouri 64106, is custodian of the assets of the funds. The custodian is       
responsible for the safekeeping of the funds' assets and the appointment of     
subcustodian banks and clearing agencies. The custodian takes no part in        
determining the investment policies of the funds or in deciding which           
securities are purchased or sold by the funds. The funds may, however,          
invest in obligations of the custodian and may purchase securities from or      
sell securities to the custodian.                                               
FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, and the trusts'      
Trustees may from time to time have transactions with various banks,            
including banks serving as custodian for certain of the funds advised by        
FMR. Transactions that have occurred to date include mortgages and personal     
and general business loans. In the judgment of FMR, the terms and               
conditions of those transactions were not influenced by existing or             
potential custodial or other fund relationships.                                
AUDITOR. _____________,  serves as each trust's independent accountant. The     
auditor examines financial statements for the funds and provides other          
audit, tax, and related services.                                               
APPENDIX                                                                        
DOLLAR-WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY is derived by multiplying the value of         
each investment by the number of days remaining to its maturity, adding         
these calculations, and then dividing the total by the value of the fund's      
portfolio. An obligation's maturity is typically determined on a stated         
final maturity basis, although there are some exceptions to this rule.          
For example, if it is probable that the issuer of an instrument will take       
advantage of a maturity-shortening device, such as a call, refunding, or        
redemption provision, the date on which the instrument will probably be         
called, refunded, or redeemed may be considered to be its maturity date.        
When a municipal bond issuer has committed to call an issue of bonds and        
has established an independent escrow account that is sufficient to, and is     
pledged to, refund that issue, the number of days to maturity for the           
prerefunded bond is considered to be the number of days to the announced        
call date of the bonds.                                                         
The descriptions that follow are examples of eligible ratings for the           
income fund. The funds may, however, consider ratings for other types of        
investments and the ratings assigned by other ratings organizations when        
determining the eligibility of a particular investment.                         
DESCRIPTION OF MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S RATINGS OF STATE AND           
MUNICIPAL NOTES:                                                                
Moody's ratings for state and municipal and other short-term obligations        
will be designated Moody's Investment Grade (MIG, or VMIG for variable rate     
obligations). This distinction is in recognition of the difference between      
short-term credit risk and long-term credit risk. Factors affecting the         
liquidity of the borrower and short-term cyclical elements are critical in      
short-term ratings, while other factors of major importance in bond risk,       
long-term secular trends for example, may be less important in the short        
run. Symbols used will be as follows:                                           
MIG-1/VMIG-1 - This designation denotes best quality. There is present          
strong protection by established cash flows, superior liquidity support or      
demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.                  
MIG-2/VMIG-2 - This designation denotes high quality. Margins of protection     
are ample although not so large as in the preceding group.                      
MIG-3/VMIG-3 - This designation denotes favorable quality, with all             
security elements accounted for but there is lacking the undeniable             
strength of the preceding grades. Liquidity and cash flow protection may be     
narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well              
established.                                                                    
MIG-4/VMIG-4 - This designation denotes adequate quality protection             
commonly regarded as required of an investment security is present and,         
although not distinctly or predominantly speculative, there is specific         
risk.                                                                           
DESCRIPTION OF STANDARD &AMP; POOR'S CORPORATION'S RATINGS OF STATE AND         
MUNICIPAL NOTES:                                                                
SP-1 - Very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest. Those      
issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be        
given a plus (+) designation.                                                   
SP-2 - Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest.                     
SP-3 - Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.                      
DESCRIPTION OF MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.'S MUNICIPAL BOND RATINGS:        
AAA - Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the      
smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt       
edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally        
stable margin and principal is secure. While the various protective             
elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most       
unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.            
AA - Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.          
Together with Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as               
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins      
of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation of        
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other           
elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than     
in Aaa securities.                                                              
A - Bonds rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to       
be considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to     
principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present      
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            
BAA - Bonds rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e, they     
are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments and          
principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective       
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any        
great length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment                    
characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well.           
BA - Bonds rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements. Their future       
cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of interest and      
principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded        
during both good and bad times in the future. Uncertainty of position           
characterizes bonds in this class.                                              
B - Bonds rated B generally lack characteristics of a desirable investment.     
Assurance of interest and principal payments of or maintenance of other         
terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.                
CAA - Bonds rated Caa are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default       
or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or         
interest.                                                                       
Those bonds in the Aa, A, Baa, Ba, and B groups which Moody's believes          
possess the strongest investment attributes are designated by the symbols       
Aa1, A1, Baa1, Ba1, and B1.                                                     
DESCRIPTION OF STANDARD &AMP; POOR'S CORPORATION'S MUNICIPAL BOND RATINGS:      
AAA - Debt rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard &amp;          
Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal       
is extremely strong.                                                            
AA - Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay         
principal and differs from the highest-rated debt issues only in small          
degree.                                                                         
A - Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal,     
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes      
in circumstances and economic conditions.                                       
BBB - Debt rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay          
interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate             
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing                  
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay             
interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher-rated     
categories.                                                                     
BB - Debt rated BB has less near-term vulnerability to default than other       
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or            
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could     
lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments.     
B - Debt rated B has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has       
the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments. Adverse        
business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or      
willingness to pay interest and repay principal.                                
The B rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt         
that is assigned an actual or implied BB or BB- rating.                         
CCC - Debt rated CCC has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default,     
and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic               
conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal.       
In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, it is      
not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal.            
The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus or         
minus to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Item 25. Persons Controlled by or Under Common Control with Registrant          
The Board of Trustees of Fidelity Union Street Trust is the same as the       
boards of other funds advised by FMR, each of which has Fidelity Management     
&amp; Research Company as its investment adviser. In addition, the officers     
of these funds are substantially identical.  Nonetheless, Registrant takes      
the position that it is not under common control with these other funds         
since the power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as        
the result of an official position with the respective funds.

Article XI, Section 2 of the Declaration of Trust sets forth the              
reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification shall be      
provided to any past or present Trustee or officer.  It states that the         
Registrant shall indemnify any present or past Trustee or officer to the        
fullest extent permitted by law against liability and all expenses              
reasonably incurred by him in connection with any claim, action, suit or        
proceeding in which he is involved by virtue of his service as a trustee,       
an officer, or both.  Additionally, amounts paid or incurred in settlement      
of such matters are covered by this indemnification.  Indemnification will      
not be provided in certain circumstances, however.  These include instances     
of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, and reckless disregard     
of the duties involved in the conduct of the particular office involved.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Laura J. Riegel, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6873 or Dalia Osman Blass, Assistant Director, at (202) 551-6821 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.
