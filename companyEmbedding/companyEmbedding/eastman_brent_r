Existing business is just as important as “new” business. BEI has clients with as few as two, to groups in excess of 1,000, employees. We take great pride in the fact that we give all clients our undivided attention and consider all questions and concerns our #1 priority. Returning phone calls and regular follow-up is the key to our continued success.
BEI has proven it can manage large volumes of business by placing clients with the correct carrier and by recommending the most effective benefits. The ongoing education and explanation of those benefits allow us to consistently compete with larger competitors and to thrive during difficult economic periods. At the core of BEI’s Client Services is 54+ years of experience working with medical groups in the Salinas Valley. BEI’s business philosophy is to provide a high level of personal service to our client’s and their employees.
