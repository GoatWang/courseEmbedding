PETization™
Human to pet in just one step. 






Our proprietary PETization platform enables the rapid translation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) between species.
Our mAbs are uniquely designed to be accepted by a patient's immune system as "native," a property we refer to as "100% species-specificity."

Read More




Our most advanced therapies in development are focused on treatments within four general areas: chronic pain, chronic inflammation, allergy, and immuno-oncology (cancer).
We believe biologic therapies as a class offer significant advantages over current treatments in these areas, including: safety, longer duration of action (and therefore less frequent dosing), and injectability.
Our team of scientists and veterinarians are working to investigate further opportunities for new biologic therapies.

The directors of Nexvet accept responsibility for the information contained in this announcement. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of Nexvet (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case) the information contained in this announcement for which they accept responsibility is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in or into certain jurisdictions may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions. Accordingly, copies of this announcement and all other announcements relating to the acquisition are not being, and must not be, released, published, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any restricted jurisdiction. Persons receiving such announcements (including, without limitation, nominees, trustees and custodians) should observe these restrictions. Failure to do so may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies involved in the acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violations of any such restrictions by any person. Under the provisions of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules, if any person is, or becomes, "interested" (directly or indirectly) in, 1% or more of any class of "relevant securities" of Nexvet, all "dealings" in any "relevant securities" of Nexvet (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such "relevant securities") must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the "business day" following the date of the relevant transaction.

A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose "relevant securities" "dealings" should be disclosed, can be found on the Irish Takeover Panel's website at www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie.

In particular, a person will be treated as having an "interest" by virtue of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.

 | Source: Nexvet Biopharma plc






DUBLIN, Ireland, June  16, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexvet Biopharma (Nasdaq:NVET) today announced the following; Recommended Acquisition for Cash by ZOETIS BELGIUM S.A. A WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF ZOETIS INC. of NEXVET BIOPHARMA PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement  under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 Announcement relating to dispatch of Rule 15 Letter On April 13, 2017, Nexvet Biopharma plc, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland ("Nexvet" or the "Company"), Zoetis Inc. (“Zoetis”) and its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary Zoetis Belgium S.A. (“Bidco”) announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition of Nexvet by Zoetis, through Bidco, whereby Bidco will acquire all of the issued and to be issued ordinary shares of the Company (the "Acquisition").  As outlined in that announcement, the Acquisition is to be implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act 2014. Nexvet, Zoetis and Bidco announced today that in relation to the Acquisition they have jointly dispatched a letter to the holders of convertible securities of Nexvet in accordance with Rule 15 of the Irish Takeover Rules to provide information regarding how the Acquisition will affect such securities (the “Rule 15 Letter”). The Rule 15 Letter is being made available for inspection on www.nexvet.com and on www.zoetis.com in accordance with Rule 26 of the Irish Takeover Rules. For the avoidance of doubt, the content of such websites is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this announcement.

Announcement relating to dispatch of Rule 15 Letter
On April 13, 2017, Nexvet Biopharma plc, a public limited company incorporated in Ireland ("Nexvet" or the "Company"), Zoetis Inc. ("Zoetis") and its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary Zoetis Belgium S.A.

Nexvet, Zoetis and Bidco announced today that in relation to the Acquisition they have jointly dispatched a letter to the holders of convertible securities of Nexvet in accordance with Rule 15 of the Irish Takeover Rules to provide information regarding how the Acquisition will affect such securities (the "Rule 15 Letter").
The Rule 15 Letter is being made available for inspection on www.nexvet.com and on www.zoetis.com in accordance with Rule 26 of the Irish Takeover Rules. For the avoidance of doubt, the content of such websites is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this announcement.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This announcement may contain forward looking statements.  All statements other than historical facts are forward looking statements, including statements regarding anticipated future results, or other non-historical facts.  They may be identified by the words "will", "may", "could", "would", "to be", "might", "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "plan", "estimate", "forecast", "future", "positioned", "potential", "intend", "continue", "remain", "scheduled", "outlook", "set to", "subject to", "upcoming", "target" or similar expressions.  These statements are based on current views, expectations, estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements.  If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialise, or if underlying views, expectations, estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward looking statement.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:  uncertainties as to the timing of the Acquisition; uncertainties as to whether Zoetis or Bidco will be able to consummate the Acquisition; uncertainties as to whether Nexvet Shareholders will provide the requisite approvals for the Acquisition on a timely basis, or at all; the possibility that competing offers will be made; the possibility that certain conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition will not be satisfied, including obtaining the requisite approvals of the Scheme; uncertainties regarding pending or future litigation challenging the Acquisition, which may seek to rescind the Scheme or enjoin the consummation of the Acquisition; the ability to meet expectation regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the Acquisition; changes in relevant tax and other Laws or regulations; the integration of Nexvet being more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; the diversion of Nexvet, Zoetis or Bidco management time and attention to issues relating to the Acquisition and integration; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) being greater than expected following the Acquisition; the scope, timing and outcome of any ongoing legal proceedings involving Nexvet, Zoetis or Bidco and the impact of any such proceedings on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; the possibility that costs, fees, expenses or charges Nexvet, Zoetis or Bidco incur in connection with the Acquisition are greater than expected; the possibility that the Scheme may be terminated in circumstances that require Nexvet to reimburse certain expenses of Zoetis or Bidco; the ability of Nexvet, Zoetis or Bidco to protect intellectual property and preserve intellectual property rights; and changes in the economic and financial conditions of the business of Zoetis or Nexvet.
In addition, actual future results and other future circumstances of Nexvet are subject to other risks and uncertainties that relate more broadly to Nexvet's business, including its future results of operations and financial position; ability to continue as a going concern; its ability to execute its business strategy, including obtaining successful pivotal study results, developing its pipeline of product candidates, completing facilities upgrades, manufacturing its own product candidates, meeting conditions for the receipt of government grants, making timely regulatory submissions, and qualifying for conditional licensure or obtaining product approvals; and those risks and uncertainties discussed in Nexvet's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC.
Furthermore, actual future results and other future circumstances of Zoetis or Bidco are subject to other risks and uncertainties that relate more broadly to Zoetis' business.  A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in Zoetis' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, including the sections thereof captioned "Forward Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors", in Zoetis' Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in Zoetis' current Reports on Form 8-K.
There may be additional risks that Nexvet, Zoetis and Bidco do not presently know or currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements.
Forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made.  Nexvet, Zoetis and Bidco expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement, except as required by Law.

      Biosimilars vs. Generics
    





Biosimilars are often confused with generic drugs—but they are not
  the same. Dr. Michael Morse explains the fundamental differences. One
  significant distinction? Unlike generics, the FDA requires a
  biosimilar to be highly similar, but not identical to the existing
  biologic medicine, which is referred to as a "reference
  product." Biologic medicines are large, complex molecules or
  mixtures of molecules that may be composed of living material. As
  such, biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
  products.

Key Takeaways
 Biosimilars are unlikely to be exact copies of their reference
    products.  Unlike generic drugs, which are chemically
    synthesized, biosimilars are grown in complex living systems. Given
    the complexity of this process, it's unlikely for biosimilars to be
    exact replicas. Biosimilars may be marked with an
    interchangeability designation, which means it meets additional
    standards and can be substituted for the reference product by a
    pharmacist, per state laws, without the intervention of the original
    prescriber.  Biosimilars are reviewed under the
    abbreviated FDA review process known as 351(k) pathway. The
    sponsor of a biosimilar demonstrates biosimilarity primarily from
    nonclinical analyses that examine the structure and functional
    nature of the biosimilar molecule. Per FDA guidance, the Agency
    reviews the totality of evidence in a stepwise approach and does not
    necessarily focus on one type of study to evaluate a sponsor’s
    application for demonstration of biosimilarity.

      Biosimilar Indication Extrapolation
    





Although the FDA may approve a biosimilar for all of the indications
  of its reference product, the biosimilar’s manufacturer may have only
  conducted clinical trials for one or two representative indications.
  Extrapolation is an important concept for biosimilars. Hear Dr.
  Gregory Schimizzi clarify this concept.

Key Takeaways 
 Indication extrapolation refers to a biosimilar being approved
    for indications that were not evaluated during the biosimilar’s
    clinical trials. Given the complexities of the science
    behind extrapolation, based on scientific justification, it may not
    be appropriate in all cases.  The FDA recommends that
    a biosimilar manufacturer choose a condition of use that would be
    adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences
    between the biosimilar and reference product.  In
    some cases, healthy volunteers may be the most sensitive population
    to study when seeking to reveal differences in immune responses, as
    healthy volunteers are not immunocompromised and, therefore, will
    exhibit normal immune responses.

      Anatomy of a Biosimilar Label
    





Under the FDA’s guidance, the label of a biosimilar and its reference
  product are essentially the same—Dr. Andrew Zelenetz explores the
  implications of this. Clear and transparent labels are key in helping
  to ensure precise prescribing decisions. 









Key Takeaways
 The FDA’s draft labeling guidance, which was released in March
    2016, recommends that biosimilar labels contain clinical data from
    their reference products, instead of the data collected from
    biosimilar trials. Because the FDA permits biosimilar
    manufacturers to extrapolate indications with sufficient scientific
    justification, it is likely that the biosimilar label will contain
    clinical data for indications in which it has not been
  studied.  The FDA guidance recommends that the
    "Highlights" section includes the biosimilar’s unique
    name, date of approval and disclosure noting it’s a
  biosimilar.  Biosimilar names contain an individual,
    non-meaningful four-letter suffix in order to distinguish them from
    their reference product or other biosimilars of the same
  molecule.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

AMPK Activator
90 vegetarian capsules
Item Catalog Number: 01907



AMPK  Activator is an oral formula that turns on AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated  protein kinase), an enzyme that serves as the body’s master regulating switch.  Increased AMPK activity helps to revitalize aging cells, promote mitochondrial  production, and inhibit multiple damaging factors associated with aging. But  despite all of the scientific research, supplemental support for youthful AMPK  levels has been largely non-existent … until now. The clinically validated  combination of ActivAMP® (Gynostemma pentaphyllum) and rose hip plant extracts, provides nutrient support for youthful AMPK levels. 
Benefits  at a Glance

Turns on master switch that revitalizes  aging cells
Promotes mitochondrial production
Inhibits multiple damaging factors  associated with aging
Optimizes cellular energy production

Revitalizing  Aging Cells through AMPK Activation
Found  in every cell,1,2 AMPK  promotes longevity factors that have been shown to extend life span in numerous  organisms.3,4 Increasing  AMPK signaling “turns off” many damaging effects of aging, thus enabling cells  to return to their youthful vitality.5

      Life  Extension® scientists have compiled years of research to create AMPK Activator,  a specialized dual-extract formulation that supports AMPK activation for health  optimization. This natural formula supports AMPK enzymatic activities required  to safely support a more youthful cellular environment.
Importance  of AMPK Activation
Greater  AMPK activation has been shown to help target damaging factors of aging.5 Studies show increased AMPK  activity supports reduced fat storage,6-8 new mitochondria production,9 and the promotion of healthy  blood glucose and lipids already within normal range.4,10
Gynostemma  Pentaphyllum Promotes Longevity and Fights Fat
An  extract of the plant Gynostemma  pentaphyllum was  traditionally used in Asian medicine to promote longevity and scientists now  know why — G. pentaphyllum promotes  AMPK activation.10,11 In  one of many studies showing a wide variety of benefits, researchers documented  a 1-inch reduction in abdominal circumference on average in overweight  individuals who took 450 mg daily of G.  pentaphyllum extract  for 12 weeks.8
Rose Hips Provides Metabolic Benefits
Trans-tiliroside,  extracted from plants such as rose hips, also boosts AMPK activation, but  triggers different downstream metabolic benefits than G. pentaphyllum.12-14 Among its many benefits, a low  human equivalent dose of 56 mg daily trans-tiliroside has been shown by  researchers in preclinical studies to promote healthy blood glucose levels and  body weight already within normal range.15
Anti-Aging Discovery That Cannot be Overlooked
Scientists  uncovered the cell-energizing effect of AMPK in the 1970s. Since then, an  exponential volume of data (over 8,500 published studies) has documented the  critical role that activated AMPK plays in maintaining life-sustaining cellular  functions.
If  you’d like to meaningfully extend your healthy life span, activating your  cellular AMPK is critical. This is important because in response to aging,  excess calorie consumption, and/or low levels of physical activity, AMPK  activity markedly declines.
You can fight  AMPK decline with regular exercise and avoiding excessive calories … but it may  not be enough. Our AMPK Activator formula is a targeted way to reverse cellular  depletion of the critical AMPK enzyme. Don’t waste another moment — try AMPK  Activator today!
This supplement should be taken in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise program. Individual results are not guaranteed and results may vary.

AMPK Activator
90 vegetarian capsules
Item Catalog Number: 01907



AMPK  Activator is an oral formula that turns on AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated  protein kinase), an enzyme that serves as the body’s master regulating switch.  Increased AMPK activity helps to revitalize aging cells, promote mitochondrial  production, and inhibit multiple damaging factors associated with aging. But  despite all of the scientific research, supplemental support for youthful AMPK  levels has been largely non-existent … until now. The clinically validated  combination of ActivAMP® (Gynostemma pentaphyllum) and rose hip plant extracts, provides nutrient support for youthful AMPK levels. 
Benefits  at a Glance

Turns on master switch that revitalizes  aging cells
Promotes mitochondrial production
Inhibits multiple damaging factors  associated with aging
Optimizes cellular energy production

Revitalizing  Aging Cells through AMPK Activation
Found  in every cell,1,2 AMPK  promotes longevity factors that have been shown to extend life span in numerous  organisms.3,4 Increasing  AMPK signaling “turns off” many damaging effects of aging, thus enabling cells  to return to their youthful vitality.5

      Life  Extension® scientists have compiled years of research to create AMPK Activator,  a specialized dual-extract formulation that supports AMPK activation for health  optimization. This natural formula supports AMPK enzymatic activities required  to safely support a more youthful cellular environment.
Importance  of AMPK Activation
Greater  AMPK activation has been shown to help target damaging factors of aging.5 Studies show increased AMPK  activity supports reduced fat storage,6-8 new mitochondria production,9 and the promotion of healthy  blood glucose and lipids already within normal range.4,10
Gynostemma  Pentaphyllum Promotes Longevity and Fights Fat
An  extract of the plant Gynostemma  pentaphyllum was  traditionally used in Asian medicine to promote longevity and scientists now  know why — G. pentaphyllum promotes  AMPK activation.10,11 In  one of many studies showing a wide variety of benefits, researchers documented  a 1-inch reduction in abdominal circumference on average in overweight  individuals who took 450 mg daily of G.  pentaphyllum extract  for 12 weeks.8
Rose Hips Provides Metabolic Benefits
Trans-tiliroside,  extracted from plants such as rose hips, also boosts AMPK activation, but  triggers different downstream metabolic benefits than G. pentaphyllum.12-14 Among its many benefits, a low  human equivalent dose of 56 mg daily trans-tiliroside has been shown by  researchers in preclinical studies to promote healthy blood glucose levels and  body weight already within normal range.15
Anti-Aging Discovery That Cannot be Overlooked
Scientists  uncovered the cell-energizing effect of AMPK in the 1970s. Since then, an  exponential volume of data (over 8,500 published studies) has documented the  critical role that activated AMPK plays in maintaining life-sustaining cellular  functions.
If  you’d like to meaningfully extend your healthy life span, activating your  cellular AMPK is critical. This is important because in response to aging,  excess calorie consumption, and/or low levels of physical activity, AMPK  activity markedly declines.
You can fight  AMPK decline with regular exercise and avoiding excessive calories … but it may  not be enough. Our AMPK Activator formula is a targeted way to reverse cellular  depletion of the critical AMPK enzyme. Don’t waste another moment — try AMPK  Activator today!
This supplement should be taken in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise program. Individual results are not guaranteed and results may vary.
