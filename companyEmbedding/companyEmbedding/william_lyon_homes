The William Lyon Homes team is focusing their development expertise to create and deliver active adult communities that will address a specific niche opportunity within the 55+ segment market, namely by offering small to mid-sized scale communities located close to urban and suburban areas enabling convenient access to the greater area amenities. In addition, the Ovation communities will feature architecture, amenities and ambiance that are innately different from the competition. Contemporary product design brimming with natural light, private indoor/outdoor living spaces and smart technology will be a defining characteristic.“At William Lyon Homes, we take great pride in understanding the needs of consumers and tuning in to their aspirations,” said Matthew R. Zaist, President and Chief Executive Officer for William Lyon Homes. “Today’s 55+ homebuyers are sophisticated and vital, and they’re searching for something different. We feel confident that these new Ovation communities will fill that niche with an entirely new interpretation of what a modern active adult community should be.”William Lyon Homes is entering the 55+ active adult market with the debut of several new Ovation active lifestyle communities in highly desirable markets including Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Lacey, Washington and Orange County, California.The builder’s commitment to a standard of beautiful aesthetics and quality craftsmanship ensures these communities will be set apart from competitors, offering distinctive single-story residential designs with open living spaces, abundant natural lighting, private outdoor spaces, quality finishes, energy-efficient amenities and useful technology features. The homes offered at all Ovation active lifestyle communities will assure buyers are not limited to “down-sizing,” giving them the opportunity to “right-size” with a home that fits their individual lifestyle.Ovation active lifestyle communities will also be characterized by a liberating and refreshing atmosphere that focuses on individual choice, fun and spontaneity. Each community location will be less remote and self-contained than typical active adult settings and will ensure lifestyle priorities are accommodated with access to retail, restaurants, outdoor recreation, medical centers, airports and more. Since approximately 70% of this market segment expects to postpone retirement, they will also be within comfortable proximity of business centers.To learn more about Ovation, Lyon Active Lifestyle Communities, visit www.OvationLiving.com for details.About William Lyon HomesWilliam Lyon Homes is one of the largest Western U.S. regional homebuilders.

William Lyon Homes Announces Creation of New 55+ Brand – “Ovation, a 
      Lyon Active Lifestyle Community”






March 31, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--William Lyon Homes (NYSE: WLH), a leading homebuilder in the Western 
      U.S., announced its new focus on the emerging 55+ active adult market — 
      “Ovation, a Lyon Active Lifestyle Community” and in the Pacific 
      Northwest, “Ovation, a Polygon Active Lifestyle Community.” By 
      leveraging its experience in product design and place-making, William 
      Lyon Homes will differentiate Ovation from traditional “cookie-cutter” 
      active adult communities by cultivating an appealing brand lifestyle for 
      55+ buyers who prefer a more intimate, unconventional and contemporary 
      residential environment.
    


      With a significant segment of the population age 55 and older, coupled 
      with their preference to own versus rent and a strong desire to seek new 
      housing opportunities that will enable them to age in place, William 
      Lyon Homes recognized the opportunity to respond to this increasing 
      buyer segment with a new approach. The William Lyon Homes team is 
      focusing their development expertise to create and deliver active adult 
      communities that will address a specific niche opportunity within the 
      55+ segment market, namely by offering small to mid-sized scale 
      communities located close to urban and suburban areas enabling 
      convenient access to the greater area amenities. In addition, the 
      Ovation communities will feature architecture, amenities and ambiance 
      that are innately different from the competition. Contemporary product 
      design brimming with natural light, private indoor/outdoor living spaces 
      and smart technology will be a defining characteristic.
    

      “At William Lyon Homes, we take great pride in understanding the needs 
      of consumers and tuning in to their aspirations,” said Matthew R. Zaist, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer for William Lyon Homes. “Today’s 
      55+ homebuyers are sophisticated and vital, and they’re searching for 
      something different. We feel confident that these new Ovation 
      communities will fill that niche with an entirely new interpretation of 
      what a modern active adult community should be.”
    

      William Lyon Homes is entering the 55+ active adult market with the 
      debut of several new Ovation active lifestyle communities in highly 
      desirable markets including Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Lacey, 
      Washington and Orange County, California.
    

      The builder’s commitment to a standard of beautiful aesthetics and 
      quality craftsmanship ensures these communities will be set apart from 
      competitors, offering distinctive single-story residential designs with 
      open living spaces, abundant natural lighting, private outdoor spaces, 
      quality finishes, energy-efficient amenities and useful technology 
      features. The homes offered at all Ovation active lifestyle communities 
      will assure buyers are not limited to “down-sizing,” giving them the 
      opportunity to “right-size” with a home that fits their individual 
      lifestyle.
    

      Ovation active lifestyle communities will also be characterized by a 
      liberating and refreshing atmosphere that focuses on individual choice, 
      fun and spontaneity. Each community location will be less remote and 
      self-contained than typical active adult settings and will ensure 
      lifestyle priorities are accommodated with access to retail, 
      restaurants, outdoor recreation, medical centers, airports and more. 
      Since approximately 70% of this market segment expects to postpone 
      retirement, they will also be within comfortable proximity of business 
      centers.

William Lyon Homes
Location: Newport Beach, Calif. Year Founded: 1956 2013 Rank: 31 2013 Closings: 1,435 Growth Since 2012: 51% Metrostudy Says: The company is known for its mix of products ranging from condominiums, townhomes, and single-family homes on varying lot sizes in Class A locations. This product diversification is important for any builder to be competitive. Its Coyote Creek community in Milpitas has been extremely successful due to its great Silicon Valley location, which has very little new construction activity and very high demand.

 Perhaps most acute in cities with especially feverish pre-recession growth, the prolonged housing slump chased scores of home builders out of coastal California, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. Yet William Lyon Homes clung to those once-sizzling markets, even as deliveries of its single-family and attached homes skidded from 3,471 in 2004 to fewer than 700 in 2011, forcing the company to whittle its 980-employee staff to 180.
 “Our thesis was when those markets did recover, that they would recover at a faster rate than the national average,” recalls president and COO Matt Zaist (pictured, left).
 So the firm held on to its sizable book of land, which is located in supply-constrained markets like coastal California, where company forecasters believed demand for new homes eventually would rebound with a vengeance. And even as it stalled a number of planned building projects, the builder continued to slowly acquire land through the downturn. That bet started to pay off in 2012 as the builder activated many of those stalled projects and doubled its year-over-year home sales revenue from 2012 to 2013, securing the builder the No. 31 spot on the 2013 Builder 100 list.
 Traditionally a builder for first-time buyers, the firm retooled its product offering during the downturn. Instead of catering only to cash-strapped young buyers it expanded into the first- and second-move-up markets. By the end of last year, 70 percent of its deliveries went to move-up buyers and 30 percent sold to new homeowners.
 In December 2012, William Lyon Homes expanded into Colorado with the purchase of the bankrupt move-up home builder Village Homes. And since then, the firm has invested $500 million in additional land, mostly in infill locations in coastal California and in Colorado and Las Vegas. By the start of this year, the builder held 13,000 lots, says CEO Bill H. Lyon (pictured, right).
 Looking ahead, says Zaist, the company anticipates it will increase its community count by north of 50 percent this year without expanding into new markets. “We think 2014 will be a better year for our company and for the industry as a whole,” agrees Lyon.
