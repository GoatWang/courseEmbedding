Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."

Mirka Abrasives & Tools


APPLICATIONS


Every job has its own unique requirements which is why Mirka offers customised solutions and recommended processes that will help you optimise your surface finishing applications. No matter what the task, choosing ‘the Mirka way’ enables you to achieve your surface finishing goals while also maximising productivity and minimising costs.


 ABRASIVES


For more than three decades Mirka has been a leading manufacturer and supplier of abrasives to the automotive industry, automotive refinishing, composite manufacturers, the wood and furniture industries as well as the metal finishing industries. We are specialized in coated, non-woven and dust-free sanding products for surface finishing. Mika's extensive product range caters for both individual operations and complete sanding systems. The unique Mirka concept of dust-free sanding, combined with our effective surface finishing solutions has replaced traditional sanding methods in many industries. The abrasive range is complemented with supplementary products and accessories, which enables Mirka to offer our customers complete sanding solutions.
POLISH


In a relatively short time, Mirka's highly effective polishing product line, Polarshine, has become the clear choice for performance conscious users. Although it was originally developed for demanding polishing operations in the automotive OEM and aftermarket sectors, it performs just as well in the marine and composite industries or any application where a high gloss end result is important. The Polarshine product range consists of polishing compounds from coarse through to fine grades and, when combined with Mirka polishers and pads, is ideal for producing a high quality result.
TOOLS


Over the past ten years a strong investment in product development has enabled Mirka to expand from a leading abrasives maker into a developer and manufacturer of complete sanding systems. An integral part of that is the ‘Mirka Power Tools’ unit which is focused on designing, developing and manufacturing of advanced new sanding machines that provide a total sanding solution and deliver real benefits to customers. For example, in 2009 Mirka entered a pioneering new phase when it unveiled the light and effective electric sanding machine, ‘CEROS’ followed by 'DEROS' in 2013. Today, Mirka’s tool range consists of electric and pneumatic sanding machines, polishing machines and industrial vacuum cleaners, along with equipment for the sanding of walls and ceilings. It’s backed up by a complete range of spare parts, backing pads and other accessories to help you get the most from Mirka’s total sanding solution.
ACCESSORIES


A wide selection of genuine Mirka accessories is available to complement the company’s extensive range of abrasives, polishes and tools. Browse through the list of accessories and you are sure to find a solution to help boost your productivity and efficiency.
