I already have the game installed but lost the disc. It won't let me play without it. I also still have the original product code. After hours and hours of searching trying to figure out how to redeem the original product code I finally got it to work. I can find the game in my Origin account now.... but.... it still will not work and is asking me for the disc. Do I need to uninstal the original one for it to work? And is there any way to save my games in progress if I have to do that? Any advice?







1 person had this problem.

Please register the game on the Sims website:
https://www.thesims3.com/registeragame.html
 
Then un-install your game and download and install it from Origin again. You can get the Origin client here:
http://www.origin.com/download
 
Please use the same email and password for both the Sims website and the Origin client.
