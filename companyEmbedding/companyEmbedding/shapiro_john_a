Our talk with John was invaluable and we will be incorporating his feedback into our strategy and product roadmap. We will be scheduling more calls with him in the future.

Amazing! John was so helpful in guiding me on specific steps to take on a new venture, and after our call I am far more prepared. Thanks John!

I called John asking for help to prepare for an associate product manager interview. We jumped straight into the interview questions and he provided very valuable feedback making me feel a lot more prepared for my upcoming interview. Thank you John.

John was extremely helpful.  While he was not versed in the specific business vertical I am working in, he had did give me some great advice about Lean Startup techniques.  He pointed me towards some sources that will help me test my ideas without making large investments up front.   And this is exactly what I was looking for.

Great call with John. Hyper informative, to the point, and well spoken. Would definitely recommend John to users...he has a wealth of knowledge that not only comes from a top tier education but  also in-the-trenches experience. Overall, very happy and will be reaching out again soon. - Rafael

A crystal-clear and productive call with John. John was able to identify the competitive products, to position mine in the competition and to identify factors of differentiation. 
He was extremely creative, suggesting two very innovative solutions to overcome a weakness that could slow down the adoption of my product. Finally he placed all the pieces together in a brilliant synthesis at the end of the call. 
I'll set up another meeting in two weeks :)

Since this was my very first Clarity call, I wasn't sure what to expect.  And to be honest, I wasn't expecting a whole lot despite John's stellar reviews.  I'm so happy to say that the call went superbly well.  With John's generosity, deep PM knowledge, and incredible experience, we were able to cover a lot of ground.  Amazingly insightful, John not only answered all the questions I had, but also put to rest anxieties implicit to the questions which I hadn't even considered.  Thank you John!

John's my go-to for all product management-related questions.  He's thoughtful, always on the spot and a good guy. I hope to continue to reaching out to him.

Macy's: Evolution in the Sunshine State
Boris Groysberg, Das Narayandas, Benson P. Shapiro and Sarah L. Abbott
In 2009, Lee O'Rourke was promoted to district vice president in charge of Macy's newly created North Florida district. This district consisted of 11 stores located in the greater Orlando area and in the east coast towns of Daytona, Melbourne, Merritt Island, and Vero Beach. The performance of these stores had lagged in recent years, and O'Rourke was charged with building a cross-functional district team to support these stores and with improving their overall performance. O'Rourke and her team were able to drive almost immediate improvement in the district's sales growth and profitability and in other key areas such as customer service scores. How can O'Rourke ensure that these stores continue to perform well going forward?

SafeBlend Fracturing
Benson P. Shapiro, Frank V. Cespedes and Alisa Zalosh
The CEO of SafeBlend Technologies must set a price for the company's environmentally friendly fracturing fluid additive. The firm is negotiating a new contract with its biggest client, Bristol Natural Gas. For the last two years, SafeBlend has been the sole provider of additives to Bristol due to aggressive negotiation and limited competition. New competitors are entering the market and the CEO believes one competitor is prepared to offer Bristol a chemically free additive for 50% less per gallon than SafeBlend. Anticipating lower bids from competitors, he considers reducing the price in the new contract to maintain the relationship with Bristol—despite the impact on revenue. However, the competition may not be able to supply enough additive to meet all of Bristol's needs, so he also considers the impact of setting a more competitive and profitable price that assumes losing only a portion of Bristol's business.

Ti-Tech (A)
Benson P. Shapiro, John T. Gourville and Craig E. Cline
This case concerns the selection and scheduling of orders by a small industrial titanium fabricator that recently has been plagued by poor deliveries and a lack of capacity. At the time of the case, Ti-Tech must decide which of four orders to accept, with capacity making it impossible to accept all four. Each order represents a different mix of labor, revenues, and potential future work. The case forces the student to choose among the four orders, given limited capacity available, other business likely to come along, and the requirements of each order. The case is an updated version of Fabtek (A).

Olympia Machine Company, Inc.
Frank V. Cespedes and Benson P. Shapiro
The management team of an industrial equipment supplier is debating the company's method of compensating salespeople. Different executives have offered different alternatives to the current method of straight salary plus expenses. Each option has different implications for business strategy, organization, control systems, and sales management requirements. As a result, the case raises issues and analytics relevant to topics such as aligning strategy and organization, strategy implementation, and cross-functional incentive systems as well as sales management.

Frank V. Cespedes, Benson P. Shapiro and Elliot B. Ross

It is aimed at companies that compete on the basis of performance initiatives rather than absolute cost advantages and low price. It is suitable for use in courses or modules in pricing, entrepreneurial management, strategy, or marketing.

Curled Metal Inc.—Engineered Products Division
Benson P. Shapiro and Frank V. Cespedes
Curled Metal Incorporated has declining sales but has developed a new product (curled metal pile driver pads) that, in field tests, deliver customer benefits that are many times CMI's manufacturing costs. Joseph Fernandez and Rajiv Sanwal of CMI's Engineered Products Division are responsible for formulating a strategy for the new product. A key issue is the price to charge for the pads.  The case raises issues of analyzing market potential, aligning price with business strategy, and the implications of a price on development and execution of integrated strategic options.

Hearts On Fire - Brand Development Manager
Frank V. Cespedes and Benson P. Shapiro
Hearts On Fire, a successful branded diamond producer, established the position of Brand Development Manager (BDM) to build the company's presence, sales, and relationships with its retail customers. After one year, the CEO, CFO and President must evaluate the impact of the BDM on retail customers, the type of person required to be successful in this position, internal coordination issues with the company's sales force, and the financial returns versus other uses of capital for the company. The case raises issues in aligning business strategy and sales management systems, motivating and managing resellers, people selection, and financial analysis of alternatives.

Cumberland Metal Industries (A): Model Year 1978 Negotiations with Beta Motors
Benson P. Shapiro
Provides the background on Cumberland Metal Industries' entry into the automotive components market as a supplier of emission control equipment parts. Cumberland Metal must decide what bid to quote on Beta Motor's 1978 model year business. The company previously had a three-year contract for 100% of Beta's business, but it is now faced with a competitive situation in which a small market share, yet one greater than 50%, is a virtual certainty.

Fabtek (A)
Rowland T. Moriarty Jr., Benson P. Shapiro and Craig E. Cline
Concerns the selection and scheduling of orders by a small industrial titanium fabricator that in recent months has been plagued by poor deliveries and a lack of capacity. Four orders are offered, from which the student must select one. Each order represents different order-mix/customer situation issues. The case forces the student to choose among the four orders, given conflicting estimates of capacity available, other business likely to come along, and the requirements of each order. A rewritten version of an earlier case.

				  Business or Company Management; 
				  Time Management; 
				  Performance Capacity;

Fabtek (B)
Rowland T. Moriarty Jr. and Benson P. Shapiro
Presents an urgent order for repair service from an important customer who had purchased an item from a competitor. The item, which TiFab had bid on, went out at a price that TiFab predicted was below the amount necessary to ensure quality manufacture. Now the customer needs to have the unit, part of a much larger production system, repaired and is willing to pay a very high price. The student must choose a price for this order, and decide whether to take it. Should be handed out in class after discussion of the (A) case. A rewritten version of an earlier supplement.

Benson P. Shapiro and Lawrence B. Levine
In late summer 1986, the management of the Manufacturing Productivity Division (MPD) of Hewlett-Packard (HP) was in the process of making major market selection and product policy decisions. MPD is a small division which develops and markets manufacturing productivity software (materials management, MRP, etc.). The product policy decisions included degree of product customization and choice of operating systems (UNIX or not?). The relationship between the marketing and research and development functions is a major issue.
