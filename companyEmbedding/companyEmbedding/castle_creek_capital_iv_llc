Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, L.P. Closes in Excess of $330 Million to Invest in U.S.-Based Community Banks

Feb 08, 2011, 15:25 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Thomas Capital Group 











 
















































 

 




















 


RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif., Feb. 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Castle Creek® is pleased to announce the final closing of its fourth fund, Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, L.P. ("Fund IV"), with $331 million in capital commitments.  The capital was raised from a diverse group of institutional investors, including public and private pension funds, prominent fund of funds and financial institutions, with Thomas Capital Group serving as placement agent.  The primary focus of Fund IV will be on recapitalization, growth equity, and buyout investments in U.S.-based community banks.
Fund IV's focus during this extended economic recovery will be on turnaround and distressed bank investments.  Castle Creek will use its deep industry knowledge and expertise to work in concert with local management to help restore profitability and enhance the growth prospects of its portfolio banks.  Thus far, Fund IV has completed seven bank investments, establishing a well-balanced and diversified portfolio across six major U.S. metropolitan markets.
"We formed our fourth fund because we believe the severe recessionary downturn over the last three years has caused significant distress in the banking arena, and the valuations of select community banks will benefit greatly from a combination of additional capital support, the ongoing economic recovery, and a building wave of M&A activity," Castle Creek Managing Partner John Eggemeyer commented.  He added that in his view "this is the most opportune time in the past two decades to invest in the community banking sector."  Castle Creek has pioneered private equity investments in banks since its inception in the early 1990s and is today one of most prominent and active private equity bank investors in the U.S.
"We have been investing in special situations and distressed managers for more than a decade, and we believe Castle Creek Fund IV is one of the most coherent private propositions targeting the continued dislocation in the financial services sector," said Jeff Collins, Portfolio Manager, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners.  "Castle Creek's operationally-focused and deeply experienced team, combined with the Fund's focus on small- to middle-markets where we believe the potential for value creation is greatest, makes for a particularly compelling investment opportunity for AIP."
In response, William Ruh, a Managing Partner at Castle Creek, commented, "We are deeply appreciative of the substantial financial commitment from such a highly- regarded group of limited partners – AIP included – and we are thankful for our partners' unwavering support during this challenging fund raising environment." Thomas Capital Group's President and CEO Sajan Thomas added, "We were delighted to work with such a high caliber and professional group and are pleased with the outcome of the fundraise.  I have great confidence that Fund IV will perform admirably on behalf of its limited partners."
For more information: Contact Carlie Headapohl, Director of Investor Relations at Castle Creek®, tel +1 (858) 756-8300.  Contact Shamone Allen-Stephenson, Director at Thomas Capital Group, tel +1 (253) 777-4477.

We are committed to the long-term success of community banking.


DISCIPLINE
Our discipline results in a deliberate, focused, and repeatable investment process. 






Our Firm
Castle Creek Capital is an alternative asset manager focused on the community banking industry. Through a series of funds and separately managed accounts, we invest at all levels of a bank’s capital structure in support of recapitalization, growth, and consolidation opportunities. Castle Creek also deploys capital for special situations, allowing us to capitalize on market dislocations. The firm currently has over $750 million in assets under management and has raised and directly invested over $1 billion in capital since 1990.
