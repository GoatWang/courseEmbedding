Customer Reviews
Amy D.Hoover, AL

 
 
 


Our center has used procare since we opened in 2001. We would never use another software.
Procare accurately tracks daily attendance, and helps us to have everything needed for every family available at the click of a button. The same ease is true for the employee element as well.
Tracking daily hours is a breeze and all of the reports help so much. My favorite part is being able to add the photos for the accounts.

ALESSANDRO FATATIS, M.D, Ph.D.
Chief Scientific Officer
Dr. Fatatis is Professor of Pharmacology and Pathology at Drexel University College of Medicine and Co-Leader of the Prostate Cancer Program at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. He is an experimental oncologist with 20 years of experience in basic and translational cancer research. Dr. Fatatis’s work is focused on the identification of the cellular and molecular factors dictating the clinical progression of prostate cancer into its more aggressive form, with the ultimate goal of identifying diagnostic markers and novel therapeutics for the effective management of patients with metastatic disease.
A major project in Dr. Fatatis laboratory led to the discovery that targeting the alpha Receptor for Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGFR) with IMC-3G3, a humanized monoclonal antibody generated by ImClone Biosystems, reduced bone metastases by 70% in pre-clinical models. Eli Lilly and Company is currently conducting Phase-II clinical trials worldwide with this antibody, now renamed Olaratumab, for several solid tumors including advanced prostate adenocarcinoma. More recently, Dr. Fatatis has obtained conclusive evidence that a relevant fraction of prostate cancer cells in skeletal metastases lack expression of the Androgen Receptor (AR) and therefore their number and clinical progression cannot be monitored by measuring Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is directly under the transcriptional control of AR.
Dr. Fatatis earned his degrees in Italy and was trained at the NIH and University of Chicago prior to joining Drexel University.

Customer Reviews
Amy D.Hoover, AL

 
 
 


Our center has used procare since we opened in 2001. We would never use another software.
Procare accurately tracks daily attendance, and helps us to have everything needed for every family available at the click of a button. The same ease is true for the employee element as well.
Tracking daily hours is a breeze and all of the reports help so much. My favorite part is being able to add the photos for the accounts.
