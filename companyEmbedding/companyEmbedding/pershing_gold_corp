Pershing Gold Corporation

Pershing Gold Corporation (Pershing Gold) is an emerging Nevada gold producer uniquely positioned to create shareholder value by fast-track reopening of the Relief Canyon Mine.  Pershing Gold’s strategy to create shareholder value has four elements:


Advance the Relief Canyon Mine to commercial production.


Continue expanding the Relief Canyon deposit through development drilling.


Explore ~25,000 acre land position to discover and develop additional gold deposits.


Create value through strategic transactions.


Relief Canyon Mine and Processing Facility
The Relief Canyon Mine property includes three open-pit mines and a state-of-the-art, fully permitted and constructed heap leach processing facility. The plant has the capacity to process gold bearing solutions from the leaching of 8 million tons of ore per year. The permitted leach pad can hold 21 million tons and can be readily expanded. The facility is ideally situated to process ore from future discoveries of satellite deposits. Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations. 
These assets present Pershing Gold with a unique opportunity to capitalize upon the synergies of an existing processing facility adjacent to a mine that has additional resources to achieve a fast-track path to production at the Relief Canyon Mine.

LAKEWOOD, Colo., June 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Pershing Gold Corporation (OTCQB: PGLC) today announced a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-18.  At the market open on June 18, 2015, Pershing Gold common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis.
As a result of the reverse stock split, the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease to approximately 21,707,228 post-split shares (prior to effecting the rounding of fractional shares into whole shares as described below) from approximately 390,730,098 pre-split shares.  In connection with the reverse split, the Company is amending its articles of incorporation to reduce its authorized common stock to 200 million shares.
As a result of the reverse stock split, the total number of shares of common stock held by each stockholder will be converted automatically into the number of whole shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock held by such stockholder immediately prior to the reverse stock split, divided by 18.  No fractional shares will be issued, and no cash or other consideration will be paid. Instead, any stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will receive one whole share of the post-split common stock.
The Company's common stock will trade under the ticker symbol "PGLCD" for a period of 20 business days after the reverse split has been effected, and thereafter under the ticker symbol "PGLC".  After the split, the Company's common stock will trade under the new CUSIP number of 715302204.
Stockholders who hold their shares in electronic form at their brokerage firms need not take any action, as the shares held in brokerage accounts will be automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding paper certificates may (but are not required to) send the certificates to the Company's transfer agent at the address given below. The transfer agent will issue a new share certificate reflecting the terms of the reverse stock split to each requesting stockholder who submits its paper certificate.
Action Stock Transfer2469 E. Fort Union Blvd.Suite 214Salt Lake City, UT 84121(801) 274-1088
All options, warrants and convertible securities of the Company (including the Company's outstanding shares of Series E preferred stock) outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split will be proportionately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the options, warrants, and convertible securities are exercisable or convertible by 18 and multiplying the exercise or conversion price thereof by 18, as a result of the reverse stock split.  The Company will issue one whole share of the post-split common stock to any stockholder who otherwise would have received a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split upon exercise or conversion of options, warrants and convertible securities.
The Company is seeking to list its common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market.
About Pershing Gold CorporationPershing Gold is an emerging Nevada gold producer on a fast-track to re-open the Relief Canyon Mine, which includes three open-pit mines and a state-of-the-art, fully permitted and constructed heap-leach processing facility. Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations.
Pershing Gold's landholdings cover approximately 25,000 acres that include the Relief Canyon Mine asset and lands surrounding the mine in all directions.

Relief Canyon
Overview





Overview
Nevada has the second largest gold reserves in the world. It has 23 major gold mines, produces five million ounces of gold annually, and has produced more than 152 million gold ounces since 1835. Nevada has a stable tax regime, robust legal framework, streamlined permitting process, nearby infrastructure and unparalleled access to qualified labor. It is ranked by the Fraser Institute as the second most mining friendly jurisdiction in the world.
Relief Canyon Mine and Processing Facility
Pershing Gold is an emerging gold producer whose primary asset is the Relief Canyon Mine in Pershing County, Nevada. Relief Canyon includes three open-pit mines, expanding adjacent open-pit-able gold deposits, and a state-of-the-art, fully permitted and constructed heap-leach processing facility. Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations. 
Pershing Gold's landholdings cover approximately 25,000 acres that include the Relief Canyon Mine asset and lands surrounding the mine in all directions. This land package provides Pershing Gold with the opportunity to expand the Relief Canyon Mine deposit and to explore and make new discoveries on nearby lands.
The plant has the capacity to process gold bearing solutions from the leaching of 8 million tons of ore per year. The leach pad is now permitted to hold 21 million tons and can be readily expanded. The facility is ideally situated to process ore from future discoveries of satellite deposits.

Relief Canyon is situated at the southern edge of the Pershing Gold and Silver trend along the Humbolt Range. It is approximately 95 miles northeast of Reno, Nevada. Electricity is available on the property, and water is available from two wells located east of the processing plant. The City of Lovelock, where Pershing Gold has it's Nevada offices, is located approximately 19 miles by road west-southwest of Relief Canyon.
Preliminary Economic Assessment
In June of 2015, Mine Development Associates of Reno, Nevada complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") on the Relief Canyon Mine. The PEA uses approximate three-year average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold and $17 per ounce of silver. The PEA evaluates the economics of two alternative mining scenarios: first, self mining by Pershing Gold with its own manpower and equipment, and second, mining through mine contractors who supply the manpower and equipment to deliver material to the Company's processing facilities. Highlights from the PEA are listed below in Table 1 and Table 2.
Table 1: Relief Canyon PEA Highlights
Initial CAPEX principally includes costs to construct leach pad space for initial leaching operations, plant upgrades, optimization and relocation of the crusher facility, mobilization of contract mining equipment or down-payment on equipment purchases for self mining, and start-up equipment and supplies. Sustaining CAPEX includes additional leach pad space for later years of production, normal maintenance, and wells, drains and other de-watering activities.
Table 2: PEA Gold Price Sensitivity Analysis, Before Tax
Self versus Contract Mining 
The PEA evaluates both Self and Contract open-pit mining options with heap-leach processing. Over the 5.8 year LOM, 513,000 oz Au are expected to be produced with average production of 88,500 oz Au/year. The NPV calculations listed below use a 5% discount rate and $1,250/oz Au.
The Self Mining option outlined in the PEA at $1,250/oz Au gives the Relief Canyon project a pre-tax NPV of $189 million. It estimates an average cash cost of $677/oz Au and AISC of $709/oz Au. Under this option Initial CAPEX would be approximately $22 million with Sustaining CAPEX of $15.8 million, and would produce a pre-tax IRR of 98% with pre-tax Net Cash Flow of $247.6 million.
The Contract Mining option outlined in the PEA gives the Relief Canyon project a pre-tax NPV of $159 million. It estimates an average cash cost of $772/oz Au and AISC of $804/oz Au. Under this option Initial CAPEX would be approximately $12.2 million with Sustaining CAPEX of $16. 6 million, and would produce a pre-tax IRR of 125% with pre-tax Net Cash Flow of $206 million.
Permitting
Pershing Gold has secured all of the permits necessary to restart and expand the Relief Canyon Mine. The permits fully authorize Pershing Gold to begin mining and heap leach processing of the Relief Canyon deposit. Mining activities and facilities covered by the permits include: expanding and deepening the open-pit mine, constructing a new waste rock storage area, significantly increasing the exploration drilling area to allow testing of high-priority targets around the existing pit, installing and operating the mercury emission control equipment in the processing plant, and operating the crusher and other equipment at the heap leach processing facilities.
The major permits now in hand include the Plan of Operations approved by the Bureau of Land Management, the Reclamation and Water Pollution Control Permits issued by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection/Bureau of Mining Regulation, and three air quality permits issued by the NDEP/Bureau of Air Pollution Control.
The permit modification to expand and deepen the pit is planned to be submitted in 2017. This sequential permitting process allows for mining simultaneous with permitting for the next phase. Similar phased permitting strategies have been used for other successful Nevada projects, including Newmont Mining's Long Canyon project.
2016 Mineral Resource Estimate
The 260,000 feet of drilling the Company has performed since 2011, plus the intercepts discovered in the historical drilling have produced a resource of 778,000 Measured and Indicated oz Au and 47,500 Inferred oz Au. The Measured and Indicated Resource has an average grade of 0.020 ounces/ton, 0.68 grams/tonne and the Inferred Resource has an average grade of 0.009 ounces/ton, 0.31 grams/tonne. Future drilling is expected to expand this resource due to untested targets surrounding the proposed PEA pit to the west, east and south.
Table 3: 2016 Relief Canyon ResourceNotes:

Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions were used to categorize the Mineral Resource.
Mine Development Associates Geologist, Paul Tietz, is the qualified person responsible for this resource estimate.
This updated resource estimate includes the results from the ~160 core hole drilling program (~95,000 feet, ~24,000 meters) completed in 2015.
Rounding may cause apparent inconsistencies.


Metallurgy
Pershing Gold has performed extensive metallurgical test work, most of which has been conducted at McClelland Laboratories, Inc. in Sparks, Nevada. These tests include 70 bottle-roll tests, 19 column-leach tests and 18 load-permeability (hydraulic conductivity) tests. This work demonstrates that the Relief Canyon mineralized material is amenable to heap leach processing. Key findings from these tests include the following:

The individual column leach testing of the nine mineralization types present, as well as composites with 2016 resource model-weighted contributions from the various types, showed an overall average recovery of 80% for crushed and agglomerated material.
Most of the mineralization types to be processed will require agglomeration.
The Relief Canyon material recovery is not very sensitive to crush size. This relative lack of crush size sensitivity supports the proposed plan for single-stage crushing to 80% minus three-inch size. The crushing plant will have an annual throughput capacity of about 5.4 million tons.
Run-of-mine processing should be possible, but would be limited to low grade, low fines material. Column testing supports the 60% recovery rate assumed for run-of-mine processing.
The PEA assumes treatment of approximately 78% of the mineralized material tonnage by crush and agglomeration, with the remaining 22% treated as run-of-mine.
The lower grade of run-of-mine material equates to about 6% of recovered gold with the remaining 94% of recovered gold resulting from processing of crushed and agglomerated material. 

Load permeability testing of individual mineralization types with high fines indicated that agglomeration cement additions in excess of 10 pounds per ton processed would be required to maintain adequate solution permeability if placed in the deepest portions (200 feet down) of the heap-leach pad. In contrast, low-fines mineralization types showed that adequate permeability could be maintained at that depth with less than 5 pounds of cement per ton processed.
Load permeability testing of blended material consisting of 30% of high-fines and 70% low- fines material showed adequate permeability would be maintained to depths in excess of the 200 feet planned heap leach pad height with a cement dosage rate of 5 pounds per ton. The PEA assumes a cement addition rate of 8 pounds per ton as a conservative budget number. Ongoing test work will establish cement addition requirements for varying ratios of high-fines to low-fines material.
Scientific and Technical Data
All scientific and technical information related to drill and surface samples, resource estimate, mineral processing, metallurgy and recovery methods, and mining for the Relief Canyon project has been reviewed and approved by either Paul Tietz, Certified Professional Geologist #11720, Neil Prenn, P.E. #7844 or Jack McPartland, M.M.S.A., #01350QP, who are each Qualified Persons under the definitions established by Canadian National Instrument 43-101. Drill core at Relief Canyon is boxed and sealed at the drill rig and moved to the Relief Canyon logging and sample preparation facilities by trained personnel. The core is logged and split down the center using a typical table-fed circular rock saw. One half of the core is sent for assay to Skyline Assayers & Laboratories of Sparks, Nevada, while the other half is returned to the core box and stored at Relief Canyon in a secure, fenced-off, area. Pershing Gold Corporation quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures include the regular use of blanks, standards, and duplicate samples.
Non-GAAP Measures
Cash costs is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by the Company as set forth below, and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Cash costs include all direct and indirect costs that would generate gold ounces for sale to customers, including mining of mineralized materials and waste, leaching, processing, refining and transportation costs, on-site administrative costs and royalties, net of by-product credits for silver ounces sold. Cash costs do not include depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration expenditures, reclamation and remediation costs, sustaining capital, financing costs, income taxes, or corporate general and administrative costs not directly or indirectly related to the Relief Canyon project. Cash costs are divided by the number of gold ounces produced for the period to arrive at cash costs per gold ounce produced.
Cost of sales is the most comparable financial measure, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to cash costs. As compared to cash costs, cost of sales includes adjustments for changes in inventory and excludes net revenue from by-product, refining and transportation costs, which are reported as part of revenue in accordance with GAAP.
AISC is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by the Company as set forth below, and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. AISC includes cash costs, as defined above, plus exploration costs at the Relief Canyon project and sustaining capital expenditures (including additional leach pads, permitting and customary improvements to the operations over the life of the project). AISC are divided by the number of gold ounces produced for the period to arrive at all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce produced.
