History[edit]
Greylock Capital was founded in 2004 by Hans Humes from a portfolio of emerging market assets managed by Humes while at Van Eck Global. Additional equity partners include AJ Mediratta, who joined the firm in 2008 from Bear Stearns,[2] Diego Ferro, who joined in 2009 from Goldman Sachs[3] and John Maguire, who joined in 2008 from Bear Stearns.
Restructuring activity highlights[edit]
Greylock Capital and its partners have participated on a number of corporate and sovereign debt restructurings in emerging markets. A selection of the firm's sovereign debt restructurings is below.

Argentina: Greylock Capital Founder Hans Humes served as co-chair of the Global Committee of Argentina Bondholders following the Argentine Republic's debt default in 2002. The Argentine default is the largest sovereign default in history.[4][5]
Greece: Greylock Capital serves on the steering committee of investors engaged in the Greek sovereign debt restructuring. Humes was the sole American representative on the Greek bond steering committee. The firm was cited as one of the earlier fund investors in Greek debt, investing as early as 2011 when the bonds were trading as low as 12 cents on the dollar.[6][7][8][9][10][11]
Ivory Coast: Greylock Capital was a member of the creditor committee that worked to restructure $2.2 billion USD in debt of the Republic of Ivory Coast.[12]
Belize: Greylock Capital chaired the creditor committee for an investor group working to restructure a large portion of the outstanding $544 million USD sovereign debt of the nation of Belize.[13][14][15]
Liberia: Greylock Capital served on the creditor committee of an investor group restructuring Liberia's pre-crisis debt, a transaction which enabled the country to reaccess international capital. Greylock Capital was highlighted for its negotiated method of sovereign debt restructuring.[16]
