FAQ's OTC Market | OTC Agent | Corporate Broker














If you would like to update your of record address in order to receive communications sent out by a company in which you own shares you will need to confirm to us in writing your name, the company of which you are a shareholder, certificate number and amount of shares (if possible), your prior address and social security number (this will allow us to easily verify who you are and also allows us to search your name against a database in the vent you become a “Lost Securityholder” as defined by SEC Rule 17Ad-17).


American Registrar is merely a transfer agent and has nothing to do with value or selling. Symbols and values for many of the companies we are agent for can be found at http://www.otcmarkets.com or http://www.otcbb.com.


In order to have the restrictive legend removed from the certificate there needs to be an exemption available to do so. You may want to contact a broker, lawyer or the company directly to discuss an available exemption. Removing the legend from a certificate is a legal question and ARTCO cannot advise whether or not an exemption is available. Our responsibility as a transfer agent is to review requests on behalf of our principals. You should prepare any documentation that you deem necessary and appropriate to establish an exemption submit it for our attorney to review. After we review your request, if we agree that an exemption is available we will remove the legend from a certificate.

Generally speaking neither ARTCO nor the majority of the companies it represents necessarily require a legal opinion. You (and/or) your client may put together whatever documentation you deem necessary and appropriate to establish an exemption and send it in for our attorney to review. If we agree that there is an exemption available we will remove the legend and send back a “clean” certificate. Per the legend stamped on the face of the certificate, either the company or ARTCO have the option of requiring a legal opinion before or after presentment. Please feel free to email us to confirm whether or not a particular company will require a legal opinion.


We decline to release the original issue or restricted (for “tacking” purposes) date of shares, as it is not public information. Dates in our records are for our purposes only and the dates do not necessarily correlate with the date on which consideration was paid for the shares. When requesting the removal of the legend from a certificate, the burden of establishing an exemption rests solely on the owner of the shares which would include establishing when you acquired or became entitled to the shares. 


The standard turn-around time on a “routine” item (a non-restricted certificate, properly endorsed, Medallion guaranteed, with a proper letter of instruction and fees paid) is 3 days from the date we receive it. We attempt to turn-around non-routine items, such as restricted transfer requests, in 3-5 days after receipt; however, we are only required to give such items diligent attention and cannot guarantee the turn-around time. 


Our policy is to discuss the status of items which might be pending with only the person who sent them in. If you are the presenter of an item and wish to inquire about its status you may do so by submitting a signed, written inquiry via fax: (801) 363-9066. 


We will provide this information if you would like to call or email us. Please have the company name and certificate number (top left-hand corner of the certificate) ready. 


An endorsement is the signature of a registered owner of a negotiable instrument placed on the reverse of the instrument or another power in order to transfer the registration of said instrument.


A Medallion Signature Guarantee is a stamp (similar to a notary) that guarantees a signature is both genuine and effective to transfer registration. Medallion guarantees can generally be obtained at a broker or a national bank. 


If your certificate is restricted it means that the shares it represents were not registered with the SEC at the time they were issued and were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements. In order to have the restrictive legend removed from the certificate there needs to be an exemption available to do so. You may want to contact a broker, lawyer or the company directly to discuss an available exemption if you want to have the legend removed from your certificate. Removing the legend from a certificate is a legal question and ARTCO cannot advise whether or not an exemption is available. Our responsibility as a transfer agent is to review requests on behalf of our principals. After we review your request, if we agree that an exemption is available we will remove the legend from a certificate. 


1.The original stock certificate(s) must be surrendered.
2.An endorsement by the registered owner(s) of the certificate(s). The endorsement can be on the reverse of the stock certificate, or on a separate stock power (which can be made by copying the back of a certificate). The endorsement must be exactly as the name is printed in the front of the certificate.
EXAMPLE: if the registration (name) on the front of the certificate is John Doe, the endorsement must be by John Doe. If the certificate is registered in a corporate name, such as ABC's & 123's, Inc. the endorsement must be ABC's & 123's, Inc., by _______ (an authorized signer), its _______ (title). All improperly endorsed certificates will be rejected and the presenter will be charged the appropriate $35 reject fee. 
3.All endorsements must be medallion guaranteed, which can be obtained at a national bank or broker.
4.Signed instructions as to how the certificate(s) are to be transferred or broken down. 
5.Name, address and TIN of all transferees must be provided.
6.Delivery instructions pertaining to how the newly issued certificates are to be delivered.
-certificate(s) sent via 1st class mail will be sent at no additional charge.
-if you provide a courier account number there is a $5 courier prep fee.
-if you provide a pre-prepared air bill the certificate(s) will be sent at no additional charge.
-if you would like the certificate(s) sent back using our FedEx account there is a $25 charge.
-if you would like the certificate(s) sent back registered mail the fee is $15, certified mail is $10.

It’s up to you to decide how you are going to send a certificate to us (as well as how you would like it returned). However, keep in mind that in the event a certificate is lost the shareholder has the burden of providing for replacing it (this would include a $75 fee to us as well as having to get and Open Penalty Indemnity Bond). It is best to send a certificate by a secure means if you are concerned it might get lost. 


You should be very explicit as to why you are sending in a certificate. We cannot make any assumptions as to why you are sending us a certificate and what you want done with it. If transferring shares provide the name, address and TIN of all transferees. If you want the legend removed from a certificate you must address the basis for removing it. You should also specify where and how you want any new certificates delivered and provide a means for delivery. Please refer to “How do I transfer my certificate?” above and email us with any questions.

If you think you have lost a certificate please be absolutely sure that it is either lost or destroyed before contacting us. Once we have been notified of a lost or destroyed certificate we are required to place a “stop transfer” against the certificate in our records and file a Lost Securities Report with the Securities Information Center. You may either call or write us regarding a lost certificate. Please click here for contact information. Once we have been notified of the loss and filed the Lost Securities Report we will send you an information packet with information detailing how to have a lost certificate replaced. Generally speaking, there is a $75 fee due to ARTCO and you will be required to obtain an Open Penalty Bond.    


If you wish to obtain a written transcript of the certificates and shares registered in your name for a particular company you must submit a written request to our office. Any request should pertain to a particular company as we do not maintain “accounts” for individual shareholders, only shareholder records for individual companies. There is a $10 fee to cover the cost of the transcript which needs to be paid at the time of request. This information will never be given out over the phone. Also, we will not inform you how many shares a certificate represents; we will provide information regarding splits, which can be used to calculate the number of shares a certificate represents.


ARTCO does not regard the number of shares a company has issued as public information, and, unless specifically authorized and instructed by one of our principal companies to release the information, declines to give the number out. Generally, inquiries should be sent directly to the company or to a companies ’34 Act reports which can be found at http://secgov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html.

Penny Stock Scam

Transfer Agent Investigated by SEC Connected to a Noveshen Pump-and-Dump Scam

June 13, 2016 ericnoveshenINFO 1 Comment



On May 25, 2016 a cease and desist was issued by the SEC against transfer agent American Registrar & Transfer Company.
This is the same transfer agent the consulting team led by Ajene Watson consisting of Eric Noveshen insisted that microcap company Simulated Enviornment Concepts, INC (SMEV)  use as a TA so that defendants, including Noveshen, could “control and influence” the transfer agent during their manipulation of SMEV’s stock price.
https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/33-10082.pdf

Connection to SMEV Stock and a list of some companies American Registrar & Transfer Co. associated with from http://www.otcmarkets.com

Below are parts of the complaint detailing the pump and dump scheme allegedly lead by Ajene Watson, and the entire complaint is here:
Lichtvwatsont


                        
The SEC defines the important role of transfer agents in preventing microcap fraud scams below:
Revisiting the Role and Regulation of Transfer Agents
https://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370540828740
“Obviously, when trillions of dollars are involved, it is important that transfer agents fulfill their responsibilities with accuracy and professionalism.  And, fortunately, that is usually the case.
Another critical responsibility of transfer agents is to keep track of the restrictive legends and “stop transfer” orders that distinguish restricted securities and control shares from freely-tradable securities.  As such, transfer agents are often in a position to prevent unregistered securities from being distributed in violation of the Securities Act.  This gatekeeper role takes on particular importance with microcap securities because typically there is little, if any, meaningful disclosure or independent research regarding such companies.  The potential for fraud and abuse in the microcap markets is well-known.[27]  Indeed, violations of the registration provisions are often associated with microcap pump-and-dump schemes and other penny stock fraud.
In fact, the Commission has brought numerous cases against transfer agents who violate federal securities law in connection with fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes.[28]  You can expect the Commission to bring more cases since, as many of you know, the Division of Enforcement has created a Microcap Fraud Task Force that will, among other things, target gatekeepers such as transfer agents, attorneys, and auditors who participate in pump-and-dump schemes and penny stock fraud.[29]
Unfortunately, in addition to those transfer agents that are active participants in fraud, there are also those transfer agents that have been duped into removing restrictive legends from stock certificates; as a result, unregistered securities have been illegally sold in the public markets.  Frequently, this occurs on the basis of fraudulent attorney opinion letters[30]  Often, however, transfer agents have acted in the face of numerous red-flags warning of an illegal stock offering.[31]  This occurs with enough regularity that I believe the Commission should clarify the steps that could be taken by transfer agents and other gatekeepers to prevent violations in the microcap space.[32]“

Transfer to Wyoming
Transfer to Wyoming
Tired of your state raising your fees, tripling what you used to pay, billing you for a business license that they said last year you did not have to pay, now billing you for two years and putting a late charge on top of it?
If your company is current with the state it is in, we can re-domicile or file for Continuation (transfer) to move your company to Wyoming for, in some cases, less than what you are being charged this year for fees.  And next year your Wyoming state fees, in most cases, will be $50! (You can move a company from any state or country).
Here are the details for moving your business or corporation to a Wyoming corporation:

You can move any type of US company. An LLC, corporation, partnership, or public company to Wyoming. This is also called a Continuance.
Your company must be current with your state. The date for it’s renewal needs to be at least 2 to 4 weeks away from the time you give us the order, to transfer the corporation to Wyoming.
We will send you an electronic document to sign giving us the right to move the company. Then we will order a Certificate of Good Standing and Certified copies of the Articles from your state.  Once we have those in hand we will combine those with the paperwork for Wyoming and submit it.
About a week after that, we will send you a new corporate kit. It will include 20 new share certificates, new corporate seal and suggested meetings.  We will also include the Articles of Dissolution that you must file with your current state.  You may have to pay them a fee to file this.
Once that is done you are done paying your state. Your company will show as dissolved in your state’s database.  In Wyoming database it will show that it was a company formed in your state on such and such a date, moved to Wyoming on the date it was recorded in Wyoming.

You will gain the following benefits with a Wyoming Corporation: 

Your yearly fee to the State of Wyoming will be $50, assuming that you have no assets located inside the state.
Your company could come under the best asset protection laws in the nation.
You will retain the original formation date of the company.
You will retain the same tax id number.
You will not have to move assets to a newly formed company, risking federal taxes.
You will get the benefit of dealing with a company that has been doing this for over 14 years.

Reasons to move out of Nevada
In 2016 you will have to file a tax return with Nevada, even if you are under the gross receipts tax limit. This is going to provide Nevada with inside information in regards your company. Information that Wyoming does not ask for.
In 2016 your minimum State fee to Nevada for a corporation, will be at least $650. If you had a Wyoming corporation, in most cases this fee would be $50.
In 2016 you may be required to list owners with Nevada. Wyoming does not ask for this information.
Reasons to move out of Delaware
Wyoming corporate law is clear in that Wyoming corporations may engage in stock buy-back programs without any restrictions.  The restrictions that apply to payment of corporate dividends, in Delaware, are not included in the provision of Wyoming law that specifically authorizes stock buy-backs.  The legal certainty provided by Wyoming law on this point is a clear advantage over the present state of Delaware corporate and case law.  Additionally, there are substantial savings on state franchise tax.  We have had public companies save over $250,000 per year in state fees, by re-domiciling to Wyoming.
The cost to re-domicile is $595 plus any fees that your current state charges for documents and filings.
If you are moving a company, check with your attorney to see if your company is doing anything that would require it to be registered in the state you are moving from.

Single tax at member level. Potential built-in gains taxed if corp. had appreciated property at time of S corp. election.



LLC Footnotes:
Here are a couple of other points about an LLC vs. a Corporation:
If you are looking for state tax savings, an LLC passes the tax through to the members. So, if the member(s) are in a state where you pay state taxes, you still pay state taxes on the profits that are passed through the LLC.
Also, in an LLC you can allocate the way you want the profits to be distributed and it does not have to be based upon the percentage of ownership. Here is an example: There are two members in an LLC that own it 50/50. However, one member is an investor only, who wants to protect his/her investment by controlling 50% of the company. But, the other member is the one doing all the work and who wants more than 50% of the profit. Just write in the agreement that the working member gets 75% of the profits, even though he/she only own 50% of the business.
S-Corp Footnotes
Here’s a point about the S-Corporation that could give people paying themselves a salary, an edge. With an S-Corp as long as you pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can take the balance as profit income. This could lower the amount of self-employment taxes that you have to pay.
Also, in Wyoming we establish all corporations as C Corporations. Wyoming does not have any state taxes, so has no need for S Corporations. If you want S Corporation status, and do not have a Wyoming LLC, you must file Form 2553 with the IRS, which is included in the corporate kit we send you, within 75 days from the date of formation of the company or by March 15th of any given tax year.
There are many factors which weigh in on what type of company to form. You should consult with your legal and/or accounting professional to make sure that you make the correct decision between an LLC or corporation.

Wyoming vs Nevada vs Delaware 
Where You Should Incorporate
 Nevada-vs-Wyoming –Delaware – Side By Side Comparison –Why Wyoming
Nevada vs. Wyoming
Wyoming state fees are 92% less than Nevada’s!  Just add that Wyoming corporation advantage up.  Be sure and include the Nevada “hidden” officer filing fees of $125 that you learn about only after you start your company there, a fee Nevada will hit you within 30 days after you start your company, and the $150, or more, filing fee based upon how many shares you want to be able to issue.   Oh, and add to that the state business license fee of $500 per year for a corporation!  You are going to be paying at least $625 per year, or more, in Nevada for a corporation, before any other services!
Wyoming has no business license fees or officer filing fees. This means we can deliver a quality company package for much less than you would pay in Nevada. And, your Wyoming state renewal fee is $50, in most cases, 92% less than what you will pay in Nevada. And, the nice thing about Wyoming is that is not the only reason to incorporate here.  Wyoming is one of the most cost effective states to incorporate in and also to maintain in following years.  We even offer shelf company services (Click here for pricing.)
According to the new 2016 edition of the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, “Wyoming has the most business-friendly tax system of any state,” for the past 7 years in a row.
Perhaps you’re one of those who have read all the web sites that promote incorporating your business in Nevada. Here are some reasons explaining why we think Wyoming is the best state to incorporate:
1. Nevada does not share information with the IRS.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada makes the IRS mad. Wyoming does share information with the IRS, but only the information given by companies with real assets inside the state.  So the IRS is not targeting you because you are in a non-friendly state (like they may in Nevada).
2. Nevada allows bearer shares.
Wyoming Answer: Nevada’s law did not say anything about bearer shares, but that law was changed in 2007 to disallow bearer shares.  If you think you need bearer shares, call us first.  You are most likely being misled.  All states have outlawed bearer shares.
3. Nevada has privacy.
Wyoming Answer: Go to the Secretary of State of Nevada’s web site and type in a person’s last name and/or first name.  You will see a list of all companies that person is a part of in Nevada.  Go to the Secretary of State of Wyoming’s website and you will find that the only way to search on a company is by company name.  You cannot search using a person’s name.
4. No taxes in Nevada.
Wyoming Answer: No state income taxes on people or companies in Wyoming and Wyoming is not considering any–, Nevada is.  As of July of 2015 Nevada installed a corporate gross receipts tax (no deductions allowed), for some corporations.  That will mean that some companies in Nevada will pay more in state taxes than they would in California!  In fact some Nevada companies will be paying one of the highest state taxes in the nation!
Don’t gamble on Nevada; research Nevada incorporation myths.
Exploding the Delaware Myth
You may have heard that Delaware is the “incorporation capital” of America. It’s true!  More than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.  If you own a Fortune 500 company (and for your sake, we hope you do) then, by all means, you should strongly consider incorporating in Delaware.  However, if you are a small- or medium-sized business that is more concerned with tax benefits, flexibility, privacy and a minimum of bureaucracy and “red tape,” then Wyoming is the clear choice for you.
You see, Delaware has an excellent body of corporate case law spanning 110 years regarding such matters as management/shareholder issues and mergers/acquisitions.  That’s precisely why the Fortune 500 are drawn to the state of Delaware.  Delaware laws tend to be “pro-management” when it comes to minority shareholder disputes.  Huge public companies have literally hundreds of such disputes pending in the courts on any given day.  So, if you are managing a Fortune 500 company, Delaware’s case law offers many insights into what you can and cannot do, and what the likely consequences may be.  Unfortunately, Delaware also has corporate income tax, personal income tax, a state franchise tax, reporting requirements, and regulations compelling disclosure of substantial amounts of information resulting in far less privacy for you.  We are always surprised at how many otherwise knowledgeable professionals advise their small business/ entrepreneur clients to incorporate in Delaware.  Well intentioned though it may be, it is not sound advice.
Perhaps you’re one of those who received such advice and have incorporated your business in Delaware.  It’s not too late!  Refer to the preceding section and you will see that we can easily “move” your corporation to Wyoming and enjoy the advantages, while preserving the original incorporation date.

Why Wyoming
As you can see from the above list, when comparing Nevada vs. Wyoming incorporation advantages, Wyoming has several that Nevada does not.
Also, with the changes that Nevada has made to its laws, in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012 and in 2015, Wyoming has become the best state in the nation to incorporate in.
If you are comparing price, Wyoming is about 65% less to incorporate in than Nevada.
Another thing that they will not tell you about Nevada.  The state is running a deficit and the Nevada State Legislature has been trying to pass a corporate income tax.  They did pass a gross receipts tax in 2015, which is the worst tax there is, since it does not allow for deductions.
Wyoming is not considering any business income tax.  Don’t gamble on Nevada passing more laws that could cost you more taxes after you incorporate there. Contact us to start your company in the best state to incorporate today!
