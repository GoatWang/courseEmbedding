THE AAA CONUNDRUM, WHAT WOULD BREAK THE IMPASSE?

Why aren’t many pension funds and investment managers buying AAA CLO paper?
– Structural issues, liquidity, regulatory reform


Should there be room for CLOs as investments in large corporate cash portfolios?
What would it take to expand the investor universe?
– Better understanding, more liquidity, less complexity, greater standardization, less optionality
– Do current spreads offer adequate relative value?
Do we have enough geographic diversity of buyers?

RESEARCHER’S ROUNDTABLE

How attractive are CLOs from a relative value perspective right now:

Across the CLO capital stack?
Compared to other asset classes?




Does the market appropriately differentiate pricing based on the collateral manager?


With weakening loan fundamentals / rising defaults anticipated:

What are the implications to the CLO market?
How can collateral manager style / strategy impact performance?




Risk Retention:

How is / will this impact the CLO market?
Can we learn anything from Europe?




What changes have you seen in the CLO buyer base over the past year?
What is your 2016 CLO Outlook for US & Euro CLOs (e.g., issuance, redemptions , key themes, etc.)

How We Invest
CLO Management

Seeks to achieve better absolute performance with less risk, while providing investors with maximum transparency
Invests in larger, liquid, broadly syndicated bank loans
Utilizes a rigorous credit research process with a low ratio of credits per analyst
Supplements bottom-up analysis with a disciplined approach to risk management and portfolio monitoring

CLO Investing

Seeks to achieve attractive absolute returns while minimizing volatility
Evaluates CLO tranches using a combination of rigorous qualitative (portfolio, manager and legal considerations) and quantitative (structural, cash-flow, collateral valuation and pricing/relative value) analysis
Utilizes a proprietary quantitative analytical tool, CLO ViewPointTM, to view and track Acis credit research team’s credit opinion on each individual loan, including ratings downgrade probability and timing, default probability and estimated recovery values












 

Acis Capital Management, Highland Capital’s Structured Product affiliate, was established as a separate SEC registered investment adviser in 2010 to specialize in Collateralized Loan Obligation (“CLO”) management and CLO investing.
A CLO is an issuance of securities (AAA to B) and an equity tranche backed by the cash flows from a diversified pool of senior secured corporate bank loans. CLOs are structured with a re-investment period, allowing the CLO Manger to actively buy and sell assets, subject to asset quality covenants for a period of 3-5 years. The return paid to the equity holders is the difference between the current yield on the underlying assets and the financing cost of the issued notes.
Highland was one of the early pioneers in the CLO market, setting up one of the first non-bank deals in 1996. Highland together with Acis has become one of the largest managers of US CLOs with over $11B under management including a secondary CLO investment portfolio with over $2 billion of assets under management. Members of the Acis team have structured and managed over $32B of CLOs across 40 vehicles, have invested in over $13 billion of CLO paper and have traded over $17 billion of structured credit paper over the last decade, providing investors optimal access to the market.
The integration of the Acis CLO platform and its rigorous investment and risk management processes focused solely on CLOs provides investors with unique investment opportunities.
