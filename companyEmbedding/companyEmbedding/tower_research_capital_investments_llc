NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION





#
CBOT 11-8056-BC




Effective Date
22 September 2014



FILE NO.:
CBOT 11-8056-BC
NON-MEMBER:
TOWER RESEARCH CAPITAL INVESTMENTS LLC
CBOT RULE VIOLATIONS:
Rule 432. GENERAL OFFENSES (in part)
It shall be an offense:
Q. to commit an act which is detrimental to the interest or welfare of the Exchange or to engage in any conduct which tends to impair the dignity or good name of the Exchange;
W. for a Member to fail to diligently supervise its employees and agents in the conduct of their business relating to the Exchange.
Rule 576. IDENTIFICATION OF GLOBEX TERMINAL OPERATORS
Each Globex terminal operator shall be identified to the Exchange, in the Manner prescribed by the Exchange, and shall be subject to Exchange rules. If user IDs are required to be registered with the Exchange, it is the duty of the clearing member to ensure that registration is current and accurate at all times. Each individual must use a unique user ID to access Globex. In no event may a person enter an order or permit the entry of an order by an individual using a user ID other than the individual’s own unique user ID.
FINDINGS:
Pursuant to an offer of settlement in which Tower Research Capital Investments LLC, acting through its affiliate Tower Research Capital LLC, (“Tower”) neither admitted nor denied the rule violations upon which the penalty is based, on September 18, 2014, a Panel of the CBOT Business Conduct Committee (“BCC” or “Panel”) found that it had jurisdiction over Tower pursuant to Rules 400 and 402 as the conduct occurred while Tower was a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and that on October 18, 2010, an Automated Trading System (“ATS”) that a Tower trading group utilized entered an excessive number of order, modification, and cancel messages during a fifty-minute time period in the March 2011 Corn futures contract on the CME Globex electronic trading platform (“Globex”). Specifically, due to a threshold configuration issue, the ATS repeatedly reacted to the presence of its own orders in the market during the fifty minutes. Once the trading group observed the excessive messaging, it corrected the configuration issue. The Panel further found that during the month of July 2011, the Tower trading group erroneously assigned the same Tag 50 user ID to two separate algorithms it employed. The Panel concluded that Tower thereby violated CBOT Rules 432.Q., 432.W., and 576.
PENALTY:
In accordance with the settlement offer, the Panel fined Tower $25,000.
EFFECTIVE DATE:
September 22, 2014

Tower Research Capital LLC is a financial services fund started by Mark Gorton in 1998.
The financial engine behind many of Mark Gorton's business and civic interests is Tower Research Capital LLC, a financial services firm that he started in 1998, following a 4½ year stint in the proprietary trading department of Credit Suisse First Boston (now Credit Suisse). At Credit Suisse, Gorton traded stocks and built sophisticated hedging tools used to analyze markets. Tower evolved these models and specializes in quantitative trading and investment strategies based on proprietary trading algorithms using a statistical methodology to identify non-random patterns in the stock markets. Buying and selling is done through an automated trade execution infrastructure.
Tower is staffed by employees proficient in diverse backgrounds such as mathematics, computer programming, physics, law, economics, engineering, finance, and more. As of 2012, Tower had 275 people in its global staff.[1]

NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION





#
CME 11-8056-BC




Effective Date
22 September 2014



FILE NO.:	
	CME 11-8056-BC
MEMBER:		
TOWER RESEARCH CAPITAL INVESTMENTS LLC
CME RULE VIOLATIONS: 
Rule 432. 	GENERAL OFFENSES (in part)
	It shall be an offense:
Q.	to commit an act which is detrimental to the interest or welfare of the Exchange or to engage in any conduct which tends to impair the dignity or good name of the Exchange;
W. 	for a Member to fail to diligently supervise its employees and agents in the conduct of their business relating to the Exchange. 
(Legacy) Rule 534. 	WASH TRADES PROHIBITED
No person shall place or accept buy and sell orders in the same product and expiration month, and, for a put or call option, the same strike price, where the person knows or reasonably should know that the purpose of the orders is to avoid taking bona fide market position exposed to market risk (transactions commonly known or referred to as wash trades or wash sales). Buy and sell orders for different accounts with common beneficial ownership that are entered with the intent to negate market risk or price competition shall also be deemed to violate the prohibition on wash trades. Additionally, no person shall knowingly execute or accommodate the execution of such orders by direct or indirect means. 
FINDINGS:	
Pursuant to an offer of settlement in which Tower Research Capital Investments LLC (“Tower”), acting through its affiliate Tower Research Capital LLC, neither admitted nor denied the rule violations upon which the penalty is based, on September 18, 2014, a Panel of the CME Business Conduct Committee (“BCC” or “Panel”) found that it had jurisdiction over Tower pursuant to CME Rules 400 and 402 as the conduct occurred while Tower was a CME member. The Panel also found that on multiple dates in December of 2011, Automated Trading Systems (“ATSs”) that Tower trading groups utilized executed numerous transactions in, respectively, multiple Micro FX futures contract markets and the S&P 500 Select Sector Index futures product suite wherein orders for the trading groups’ accounts self-matched. Although the self-match transactions caused volume aberrations in the contract markets, the transactions did not cause price aberrations and the trading groups did not profit from the transactions. The Panel further found that although the trading groups did not design the ATSs to execute self-match transactions, the trading groups should have known that the orders entered by the ATSs would match. Moreover, the Panel found that the wash transactions occurred as a result of the trading groups’ failure to employ effective functionality designed to minimize self-matches. The Panel concluded that Tower thereby violated CME Rules 432.Q., 432.W., and 534.
PENALTY:	
In accordance with the settlement offer, the Panel fined Tower $65,000.
EFFECTIVE DATE: 
September 22, 2014
