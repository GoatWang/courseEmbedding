  Jan 03, 2012 10:04 AM ET Marc Montagner Joins LightSquared as CFO Previously served as EVP at LightSquared's predecessor Sky TerraBy By John Eggerton  Marc Montagner, managing partner at mergers and acquisitions advisory firm Dupont Circle Partners, has joined LightSquared as chief financial officer.  It will be something of a homecoming for Montagner, who was EVP, sales, marketing and strategy, for LightSquared's predecessor, Sky Terra. LightSquared has continued to line up wholesale partners for its planned national 4G wireless broadband network while awaiting the FCC's go-ahead. It got a waiver from the commission to use its satellite spectrum to deliver terrestrial wireless service, but that waiver is on hold pending resolution of interference issues with GPS, which uses an adjacent spectrum band. Montagner's resume includes postings at Banc of America Securities, Morgan Stanley and SVP, corporate development and mergers and acquisitions for Sprint Nextel.

BURLINGTON, Mass., May  16, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EIGI), a leading provider of cloud based platform solutions, today announced that Marc Montagner has been appointed Interim Chief Operating Officer in addition to his current position as Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Montagner has served as Endurance’s CFO since September 2015 and will continue to report to Hari Ravichandran, the company’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer until the CEO transition plan is completed. As previously announced, Endurance is actively conducting a search to identify Mr. Ravichandran’s successor. Mr. Montagner has nearly 20 years of extensive experience across relevant industries having previously served as CFO at LightSquared, Inc. as well as Executive Vice President of Strategy, Development and Distribution at the satellite communications company. He also served as Managing Partner of DuPont Circle Partners LLC, as well as Managing Director and Co-Head of the Global Telecom, Media and Technology Merger and Acquisition Group at Banc of America Securities. Until 2006, he was Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and M&A with the Sprint Nextel Corporation. Prior to 2002, Mr. Montagner was a Managing Director in the Media and Telecom Group at Morgan Stanley. “Marc has served Endurance well during his tenure and we welcome his strong operating experience,” said Hari Ravichandran. “We expect that this expanded role will ensure consistency within the organization as the company evolves and we transition leadership.” Endurance also announced the appointment of Allen M. Chaves Jr. as the company’s new Chief Technology Officer. Chaves brings 28 years of technology strategy and software architecture experience with him to Endurance, where he will spearhead the vision and strategic direction for all of the company’s software offerings. He will directly lead the software engineering teams for Endurance and will work closely with executive management to implement platforms that support the business strategy, ensuring Endurance’s products, technology platforms and architectures evolve to support emerging customer and market opportunities. “We’re pleased to have Allen join our team to help improve the technology capabilities of our software offerings across our key brands,” said Hari Ravichandran. “As we continue to make operational improvements across the company, we’re committed to investing in the right talent to help us become better positioned in the marketplace. I’m confident that with Allen’s leadership and platform architecture expertise, we’re well on our way to meeting our business goals.” Chaves has led the technology architecture teams at several notable technology organizations. He joins Endurance after serving most recently as Chief Software Architect for Ultimate Software, where he led the technology strategy and architecture for Ultimate’s SaaS products, shared services, big data, and cloud. Previously, Chaves served as Chief Architect and Director of Engineering for the Quickbooks Online Platform at Intuit. In this role, Chaves was responsible for all aspects of the technology and architecture of an 800M+ business unit and led a team of senior engineering leaders and architects. He also held the position of Principal Software Architect for Sage, where he led the creation of Sage’s SaaS HRMS product. Chaves holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil.
