Mall REITs lead broad-based selloff of real estate-related stocks 
Real estate-related stocks were the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 on Monday, led by mall REITS, on continued concerns about weak traffic and the onslaught on bricks-and-mortar stores from juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. . The sector has struggled this year as a record number of retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, while others have announced store closures. Retailers like Macy's Inc. , which reports first-quarter earnings this week, and Sears Holdings Corp.  are viewed as anchor stores that help draw traffic to malls, to the benefit of specialty retailers, who rely on that traffic boost. Among individual stocks, Kimco Realty Corp. , an operator of outdoor malls, was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%. Macerich Company  slid 2.5%, Simon Property Group Inc.  was down 2.3% and GGP Inc.  fell 2.1%. Federal Realty Investment Trust  and Regency Centers Corp.  fell 1.9%.  The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  was down 0.3%. The S&P 500  was down 0.2%.

Some mall landlords now making risky investments in tech startups
Macerich wrote off $10M that it invested in WithMe, a company that promised to bring online sellers into physical spaces

 June 20, 2017 03:05PM












Shops at Brickell City Centre
Facing an ever-growing threat from e-commerce, mall landlords across the country are trying to counter their falling retail revenues by making bets on tech startups.
In recent months, Macerich Co., Simon Property Group, Westfield Corp. and CBL & Associates Properties have all taken venture capital-style risks into clicks-to-bricks ventures, the Wall Street Journal reported.
But it’s a strategy that comes with heaps of risk.
Macerich, for example, wrote off $10 million that it invested in WithMe, a company that promised to bring online sellers into physical retail spaces with pop-up shops, opening in six malls in California, Oregon, Virginia and Illinois. The cost of the build-outs was more than Macerich anticipated, according to the Journal.
“They really built themselves as being the bridge between clicks and bricks, which, had it turned out to be that, it would have been a wonderful business,” Macerich CEO Art Coppolla told the newspaper.
Some of its other investments in tech-oriented tenants and retailers total about $8 million, and have been more successful.
Mall owners have also looked to improving their customers’ smartphone experiences to compete with e-commerce giants like Amazon, which last week announced it will buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, breaking into brick-and-mortar in a big way.
In 2015, CBL had a pilot program to promote beacons, in-store devices that engage with mobile apps to offer location-based discounts and coupons to customers.
But mall landlords say it’s difficult to gauge the lifespan of firms and products like WithMe. “We want to make sure we’re not jumping onto a bandwagon on technology that’s going to be obsolete in 18 months,” said CBL’s Jim Ward. [WSJ] – Grace Guarnieri

Autodesk - The Macerich Company

The Macerich CompanyTHE CHALLENGEFounded in 1972, the Macerich Company (Macerich) has become one of the largest owners and operators of regional shopping malls in the United States. The company's proactive growth and management strategies are at the heart of its success. But, until recently, its property management practices were slowed by dependence on paper-based, color-coded property plans. Since turning to Autodesk MapGuide and Oracle solutions to generate color-coded plans online, Macerich now has the information it needs to make better, faster decisions, saving thousands of hours each year in the decision-making process.  A Dominant ForceMacerich's business strategy is simple: purchase leading regional malls and turn them into dominant regional malls through smart redevelopment, leasing, and marketing practices. With its occupancy rates and tenant sales consistently among the highest in the industry, the strategy is an undisputed success. "At Macerich, we strive to be a great company in general, not just within our industry," explains J.P. Jones, Macerich's chief information officer. "We're always looking for innovative ways improve our processes and technology. Where many in the industry are still using highlighters and spreadsheets to color code property plans, we're doing it instantly with Autodesk MapGuide. It's helping us to carry out our business strategy even more effectively." As is often the case, innovation came hand in hand with unfamiliar technology. Embracing Autodesk MapGuide meant that Macerich's IT staff needed to learn how to integrate graphical data with tabular data. So Macerich turned to the Autodesk MapGuide experts at Autodesk Consulting to lead the implementation. "After Autodesk Consulting implemented the solution, the Autodesk team worked alongside our developers to ensure a smooth transition," says Lori Andrade, a business analyst with Macerich. "The process was very collaborative, and we learned a great deal about different ways to use and represent data. The Autodesk team made sure we got the solution we wanted and the knowledge to keep enhancing it." A Slow, Static Plan Coloring ProcessThe practice of color coding property plans has long been an important—if somewhat low-tech—part of retail property management. Traditionally, a leasing or property manager used a highlighter to mark up a paper plan of a property based on the criteria that need to be analyzed or illustrated. Different colors are used to represent where a particular store stands in relation other stores in the property. For instance, a color-coded lease plan—visually depicting different lease expiration dates in different colors—is used to analyze and account for upcoming vacancies in a property. In the leasing process, a lease plan that is colored based on sales volume by location and store type can be used to sell a potential tenant on leasing a location. "Colored plans are a great tool for understanding and illustrating what's happening or needs to happen with a property," says Andrade. "The easier they are to create, the easier they are to use as a proactive decisionmaking or leasing tool."Before turning to Autodesk MapGuide, the lease plan color-coding process at Macerich was incredibly tedious. Employees who needed a colored plan created each one individually, using a black and white paper plan, highlighters, and tabular data. Not merely slow, the plans were out of date as soon as the ink dried. Because it was so time-consuming to color plans for presentations, leasing staffers were hampered in their ability to create as many high-quality, custom plans as they would have liked. And on the enterprise level, color-coded lease plans for every Macerich property were only updated on a quarterly basis. "We're in a dynamic business, but the colored paper plans we used were completely static, limiting our ability to manage proactively," says Jones. "Our Oracle database contained the real-time data we needed for over 8,000 individual leases, but in a tabular form. We needed a faster way to turn reports and leasing data into color-coded plans." THE SOLUTION Choosing the Right SolutionIn 2002, Macerich acquired Westcor, another owner and operator of regional malls. With J.P. Jones as its CIO, Westcor had adopted a digital solution several years prior. When Jones became the CIO of Macerich, he decided it was time for Macerich to throw away its highlighters. Although the solution Westcor used was better and faster than coloring plans by hand, the solution wasn't compatible with Macerich's Oracle Property Manager database. Jones says, "We collect over 420 data points per lease in our Oracle database, and we wanted a solution that could use that wealth of data to build color-coded and interactive floor plans."Ready to adopt a digital solution, the Macerich team evaluated three plan colorcoding products, including Autodesk MapGuide. The decision-making team was impressed with the wide array of processes, such as facilities management, infrastructure maintenance, and land use planning, for which companies and governments were utilizing Autodesk MapGuide. But it was Autodesk MapGuide's ability to integrate with Oracle technology that sold Macerich on the Autodesk solution. "Autodesk MapGuide is a very dynamic tool," notes Jones. "And because MapGuide is designed to integrate seamlessly with Oracle database technology, we thought it was the perfect vehicle for making our data more dynamic." The Implementation: Autodesk Consulting DeliversIts technology choice made, Macerich assembled an implementation team to carry out its vision. Autodesk Consulting, chosen for its strong methodology and expertise with both graphical and tabular data, led the Autodesk MapGuide implementation from the beginning. At every phase of the project, from defining the requirements to designing the user interface and building the application framework to knowledge transfer, the Autodesk Consulting team took a collaborative approach and worked closely with Macerich's IT department and end users. Two other key players also collaborated with Macerich and Autodesk Consulting on the project. Already on hand to work with Macerich's Oracle Property Manager database, Oracle Consulting created the data structures. And CADsoft Consulting, a provider of technology services to design professionals, prepared the CAD standard and graphical data.One of the key challenges on the project was ensuring that the solution could develop meaningful data for each of Macerich's properties without property-by-property customization. In terms of revenue and performance, each property in Macerich's portfolio is distinct and has unique targets. For instance, rents and sales per square foot can vary widely by region. To account for these differences, Autodesk Consulting customized the solution to analyze information dynamically and to generate performancebased color legends automatically. "By averaging the lease and sales information coming from our Oracle database, Autodesk MapGuide creates meaningful lease plan legends on-the-fly," says Jones. "So in a color-coded lease plan, red means 'take action' and blue means 'okay' across all our properties. Autodesk Consulting really understood our business needs and made sure the solution met them." Eager to deliver its integrated solution to employees quickly, Macerich gave the implementation team just nine weeks to develop the first release. The team was up to the task. Autodesk Consulting held weekly demonstrations with the Macerich team, soliciting its approval for design choices at every stage of the process. This allowed for nimble course corrections while keeping the project moving forward quickly and effectively. According to Jones, "Autodesk Consulting brought a consistent and rigorous methodology to every phase of the implementation. Because the roles were well defined at the outset, we never had a conflict around scope. Everyone on the project was focused and delivered on schedule and on budget." View LargerImage Courtesy of The Macerich Company. Managing in Full ColorFollowing its rapid implementation, Macerich unveiled its Autodesk MapGuide solution, dubbed the Macerich Interactive Lease Plan, in dramatic fashion at a meeting of C-level executives. The presenter, Lori Andrade, only had a few hours to learn the product, but thanks to Autodesk MapGuide's ease-of-use and the Autodesk Consulting team's skills, she was well prepared. "Our executive team is very visual, so it was exciting to see their reaction to the solution," says Andrade. "They dove right into the application. During the meeting, we created various views of a property and identified areas of concern. You can't do that on-the-fly analysis with tabular data or hand-colored lease plans." The solution was rolled out to Macerich employees with the ability to run six different types of reports, each containing multiple data parameters. For instance, a property manager can create a color-coded lease plan that references information such as expiration dates, rent or sales data. "We're already developing additional reports based on user feedback," reports Jones. "From a property or facility management perspective, the Autodesk MapGuide solution gives our employees a new way to analyze and understand performance across a property. In leasing meetings, the color-coded plans are a quick way to illustrate why a specific location might be ideal for a business."Macerich's smooth Autodesk MapGuide implementation set the stage for its successful adoption of the solution. Macerich attributes much of that success to Autodesk Consulting's ability to convey its Autodesk MapGuide expertise the rest of the team. "Autodesk Consulting was very organized, approachable, and responsive," says Andrade. "There was a real knowledge transfer at every stage of the implementation process."Sold on the value of visual information for its leasing and property management employees, Macerich plans to roll out Autodesk DWF Composer, a tool for sharing and annotating design files. Macerich's leasing and property management staff will use the tool to notate designs to speed presentation creation. "With DWF Composer, our leasing managers will be able to mark up designs and demonstrate the potential of our retail spaces to prospective tenants during the lease negotiation process," says Andrade. "Also, since Composer is compatible with AutoCAD®, it will facilitate updates to our lease plans by our CAD designers. It's going to streamline and clarify some of the more detailoriented aspects of the leasing process." THE RESULT 2,500 Hours Saved Annually and Improved AnalysisThe Autodesk MapGuide solution is not just a great fit with the Macerich's proactive management philosophy, but it's also saving the company's employees thousands of hours annually. According to Jones, "Our Autodesk MapGuide solution is helping us to make profitable decisions and find new opportunities, such as advantageous tenant moves, more quickly by giving us better visibility into the data in our Oracle database. Compared to coloring lease plans by hand each quarter, our Autodesk MapGuide solution is saving us 2,500 hours annually. Autodesk Consulting's expertise and strong methodology played a key role in the success of our solution."He adds, "Autodesk MapGuide is also helping us to create more plans more often. We're now updating all our lease plans on a weekly instead of a quarterly basis. The solution helps us to explore and understand things like why sales might be low in one area of a property. These kinds of analyses were very time-consuming before our MapGuide implementation."

Macerich Schedules Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release And Conference Call






Macerich To Present At REITWeek 2017: NAREIT's Investor Forum®













Macerich Becomes #43 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Mettler-Toledo International
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Macerich is a self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust headquartered in Santa Monica, California. It is the third-largest owner and operator of shopping centers in the United States.[4]
It traces its antecedents to the MaceRich Real Estate Company founded in New York in 1964 by Mace Siegel and Richard Cohen who combined their first names to name their company. After years of buying and owning shopping centers privately, in 1994 the company went public as "The Macerich Company". In 2006, the company name was rebranded to "Macerich."

Acquisitions[edit]
In 2002, Macerich acquired Phoenix-based Westcor Partners for $1.475 billion. The purchase added nine properties to Macerich's portfolio, including Scottsdale Fashion Square.[5] Three years later, it acquired Rochester-based Wilmorite Properties for $2.333 billion, adding 11 shopping centers to Macerich's portfolio including Tysons Corner Center.[6]
Potential merger[edit]
On April 1 2015, the company rejected a $16.8 Billion takeover offer from Simon Property Group. Macerich rejected the takeover bid on the grounds that Simon undervalued the company and its future potential growth.[7][8]

NORAD Tracks Santa Program[edit]




Lt.-Gen. Rick Findley, deputy commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and Robert Taylor, senior property manager at Citadel Mall, perform the ceremonial ribbon cutting during the Nov. 18, 2005 launch of the Citadel Mall's Santa Tracking Station.


The Macerich Company was a NORAD Tracks Santa program partner and sponsor for the 2005 and 2006 NORAD Tracks Santa seasons. As part of that sponsorship, from November 18 to December 25, 2005, for the 50th anniversary of the NORAD Tracks Santa program, the Citadel Mall (owned by The Macerich Company from 1997 to 2006) had a massive Santa Tracking Village that included a 25-foot tree, a tracking map and viewfinder where children and the young at heart could watch a NORAD Tracks Santa video, hear audio messages of peace from children around the world, and receive a 24-page coloring book with Santa's assistants wearing NORAD patches.[13][14] This NORAD/Santa Tracking Station effort was expanded upon, in cooperation with the Becker Group [1], so that by November 2007, NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations were featured at Macerich property locations, such as:[15][16]

The NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations featured many interactive elements, including a state-of-the-art green screen photo operation, which digitally puts Santa and guests into an airborne sleigh flying over famous world landmarks. The overall experience provided retail centers with multiple benefits such as extended "stays of visit," additional, and changing foot-traffic patterns and property brand recognition. The result was a wonderful, and inventive boost to the physical shopping experience at the Macerich malls featuring NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations.[15]

NORAD Tracks Santa Program[edit]




Lt.-Gen. Rick Findley, deputy commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and Robert Taylor, senior property manager at Citadel Mall, perform the ceremonial ribbon cutting during the Nov. 18, 2005 launch of the Citadel Mall's Santa Tracking Station.


The Macerich Company was a NORAD Tracks Santa program partner and sponsor for the 2005 and 2006 NORAD Tracks Santa seasons. As part of that sponsorship, from November 18 to December 25, 2005, for the 50th anniversary of the NORAD Tracks Santa program, the Citadel Mall (owned by The Macerich Company from 1997 to 2006) had a massive Santa Tracking Village that included a 25-foot tree, a tracking map and viewfinder where children and the young at heart could watch a NORAD Tracks Santa video, hear audio messages of peace from children around the world, and receive a 24-page coloring book with Santa's assistants wearing NORAD patches.[13][14] This NORAD/Santa Tracking Station effort was expanded upon, in cooperation with the Becker Group [1], so that by November 2007, NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations were featured at Macerich property locations, such as:[15][16]

The NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations featured many interactive elements, including a state-of-the-art green screen photo operation, which digitally puts Santa and guests into an airborne sleigh flying over famous world landmarks. The overall experience provided retail centers with multiple benefits such as extended "stays of visit," additional, and changing foot-traffic patterns and property brand recognition. The result was a wonderful, and inventive boost to the physical shopping experience at the Macerich malls featuring NORAD/Santa Tracking Stations.[15]

Macerich is a self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust headquartered in Santa Monica, California. It is the third-largest owner and operator of shopping centers in the United States.[4]
It traces its antecedents to the MaceRich Real Estate Company founded in New York in 1964 by Mace Siegel and Richard Cohen who combined their first names to name their company. After years of buying and owning shopping centers privately, in 1994 the company went public as "The Macerich Company". In 2006, the company name was rebranded to "Macerich."

Acquisitions[edit]
In 2002, Macerich acquired Phoenix-based Westcor Partners for $1.475 billion. The purchase added nine properties to Macerich's portfolio, including Scottsdale Fashion Square.[5] Three years later, it acquired Rochester-based Wilmorite Properties for $2.333 billion, adding 11 shopping centers to Macerich's portfolio including Tysons Corner Center.[6]
Potential merger[edit]
On April 1 2015, the company rejected a $16.8 Billion takeover offer from Simon Property Group. Macerich rejected the takeover bid on the grounds that Simon undervalued the company and its future potential growth.[7][8]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
