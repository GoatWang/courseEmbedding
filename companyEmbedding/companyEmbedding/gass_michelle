Women to Watch 2007 
Michelle Gass
Starbucks Corp.

Call her a bull in a coffee shop. 


As senior VP-chief merchant, global product for Starbucks Corp., Michelle Gass presides over the worldwide product and development teams for 250 products and most of the company's revenue. It's a massive challenge as the chain works to rein in the commoditization famously outlined in a recent company memo from Chairman Howard Schultz.




Michelle Gass, senior VP-chief merchant, global product, Starbucks Corp.



"This is just the beginning of the journey for Michelle," says Jim Donald, Starbucks president-CEO, who dismisses the memo as business as usual. "Of all things," he says, Ms. Gass "has a very high sense of urgency." Such motivation helped her drive Frappuccino from a two-flavor novelty at the Seattle-based coffee chain into a $2 billion brand.  


In talking with customers, she realized they were using the creamy drinks more as a mini-escape than as a coffee break. But when it came to how the drinks were served and marketed, "there was a pretty big disconnect," says the 39-year-old Maine native who holds a degree in chemical engineering and an MBA. As with poorly shot vacation photos, the full experience was lost in the visual.


When she prepared to launch the Caramel Frappuccino, Ms. Gass envisioned a bigger potential for the beverage. To create an emotional indulgence factor, she proposed adding a caramel drizzle and domed lid to dress up the drink and switching the generic red straw to green to reinforce the brand iconography.


These seemingly small changes became a big battle with baristas and operations management who argued they would complicate operations and slow service. Amid a heated debate with a ranking executive, Ms. Gass refused to launch without the drizzle or domed lid.


"If you don't do it in its full concept, then you can't have it," Ms. Gass asserted. She says: "I'm a quantitative person, but when it comes to decisions and conviction, I'm more about passion and gut. If you take the easy road all the time, if you go with 'Squirt a little bit of syrup in it,' it might be a hit but won't be a big innovation. If we had not done that, I don't know if we'd have the Frappuccino business we have today."


"She's smart enough to recognize that we've got 13,000 focus groups that take place in our stores every day, and listens to what she hears and modifies appropriately," says Jim Alling, president-Starbucks Coffee U.S.


Headline-grabbing memo aside, Ms. Gass considers food to be her biggest challenge. "We're still figuring that out," she says. "It's going to be a journey, but it's a key priority for us. For me, food is the next Frappuccino."

      Seattle’s Best Coffee president Michelle Gass turning around brand

Seattle's Best Coffee president Michelle Gass is known at Starbucks' headquarters for transforming Frappuccinos in the 1990s into its most popular beverage. The key was her insistence on a visually appealing drink with caramel drizzle and a plastic domed lid.

If Howard Schultz has a go-to executive, Michelle Gass is it.
When Schultz returned as Starbucks’ CEO two years ago, he quickly snatched her away from marketing and product oversight to serve in his new, two-person “Office of the CEO,” which meant talking strategy and next steps with him one-on-one.
“We were courageous and disruptive,” Gass says of that effort. “I felt unleashed, with his energy and vision and willingness to be courageous. For someone like me who thrives on that, it was like, ‘Wow! This is going to be a ride.’ “


After their turnaround plan jelled, Gass orchestrated some of the chain’s biggest moves — including putting together teams to launch Starbucks’ loyalty-card program and its instant coffee.

She is known at headquarters for transforming Frappuccinos in the 1990s into Starbucks’ most popular beverage. The key was her insistence on a visually appealing drink with caramel drizzle and a plastic domed lid.
When the head of operations complained about the added complexity, Gass refused to launch without the embellishments. She had customer feedback to support the idea that theater was important for that particular beverage, and she had the gumption to stand behind it.
Frappuccinos now bring in more than $2 billion a year in sales, out of the company’s $10 billion total.
As Schultz puts it, Gass “possesses a rare leadership combination of courage, conviction and belief in her people that has made her an invaluable asset to Starbucks.”
About the time Gass and her team rolled out Starbucks’ instant coffee in 2009, Schultz called her into his office. He wanted her to head up Seattle’s Best Coffee, a chain Starbucks had bought in 2003 and not done much with. It had about 550 cafes, most of them in Borders bookstores.

Her only orders were to “make it huge, and you get to own it all.”
On a mission
In fewer than two years on the job, she is well on her way.
Gass — which rhymes with “floss” — has overhauled the identity of Seattle’s Best, making it big and bold and completely separate from Starbucks.


Seattle’s Best Coffee is sold now at 50,000 locations, including Subway and Burger King shops, AMC Theatres and the United Nations building in New York; Schultz has said he expects it to become a $1 billion brand. It’s growing in the double digits now, but Starbucks won’t say how big it is.
Gass, 43, has no illusions about Seattle’s Best becoming the next Starbucks, which is known for its cafés.






Her vision is for Seattle’s Best to bring good coffee to people wherever they are, from fast-food restaurants to hotels.
“What if Seattle’s Best could be the brand that basically eradicates all the bad coffee out there?” she asks, eyes lit by the possibility.
Gass wants to “create an emotional connection around fun and optimism and a level of approachability and simplicity.”
It sounds a lot like her.
A runner who majored in chemical engineering, she learned while working at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati that she prefers consumers to chemical plants.
“It’s about the humanity, the emotion,” Gass said. “People are complex; they’re ever changing and evolving.”






After six years at Procter & Gamble, she moved with her husband, Scott Gass, to Seattle, which they loved for its entrepreneurial opportunities and vibrancy.
Gass met someone from Starbucks while working on her MBA at the University of Washington, and started as the Frappuccino marketing manager in 1996.
It was a year-old drink at that point and well-liked, but nothing indicated it would be a sales wonder until Gass added her touches.
She has made changes to the Seattle’s Best look, too, unveiling a new logo for the brand and numbering and color coding its packaged coffees so that customers can easily understand what kind of roast they are buying.
“I would literally stand in a grocery store and watch people try to pick their coffee, and in some cases they would turn away without anything,” Gass said. “Everything had gotten pretty serious and dark, and everything looked the same.”
No. 1 and No. 2, which are yellow and orange, are lighter blends than either Seattle’s Best or Starbucks has offered before — the kind of roast that often appeals to people coming off a Folgers habit. And the lineup of five coffee packages is conspicuously missing Starbucks green.






Gass has a talent for knowing what customers will like, said Chris Bruzzo, Starbucks’ online chief, who has worked with her closely during his five years at the company.
“When we’re in meetings and she says something is a ‘big idea,’ that’s when you know you’ve got it,” said Bruzzo, who remembers Gass using that phrase to describe many ideas during Starbucks’ turnaround — including the notion of using a taste challenge to persuade customers to try its new instant coffee.
Head for details
Experience with Starbucks products obviously helps, but Gass also spends a lot of time talking to customers, he said, “understanding what they think and care about.”
She also knows how to motivate people, Bruzzo said.
Gass moved the 200 people who work for Seattle’s Best Coffee from disparate cubicles all over the building into a new, separate space at headquarters that features red-carpet red as prominently as the rest of the building does green.






“She gets people to work stronger, harder, to be more committed and have an ‘everything matters’ mentality,” Bruzzo said.
Gass’ engineering background gives her a strong grasp of numbers and details, which help make her a clear thinker who conveys her ideas easily to the people she works with.
But her heart leans toward marketing and branding.
Take her enthusiasm about even Seattle’s Best Coffee’s name. The name — Seattle — oh my gosh, not only will that translate in the U.S., but it will translate globally.”
There are no plans to move Seattle’s Best into foreign markets beyond Canada. Focus Brands operates Seattle’s Best locations in a handful of countries, including Japan, an arrangement that was struck before Starbucks bought the company and does not bring it any money.
Gass’ fun side comes out in all aspects of the brand. Seattle’s Best business cards are now color coded to match its new coffee packages, and they include feisty quips like, “Your eyes won’t open themselves” and “My other business card takes cream and sugar.”






And she gets jazzed about the carton for Seattle’s Best Coffee’s new canned coffees. On the bottom are icons of a rain cloud, a coffee mug and a bicycle — along with a reminder that it’s from Seattle, “where folks drink more coffee than water.”
“I’m a zealot about the thoughtfulness of the details,” Gass said. “To start over with a brand is so refreshing, because everything we do is an opportunity to connect with the consumer or a potential business partner.”

Kohl's gives long-vacant merchandising job to ex-Starbucks exec Michelle Gass

Michelle GassMilwaukee Journal Sentinel




By Rick Romell of the Journal Sentinel

June 11, 2015

Michelle Gass, the former Starbucks executive who came to Kohl's Corp. two years ago amid a wave of organizational change, has been named chief merchandising officer at the big retailer.The appointment fills a critical post at Kohl's, one that has stood vacant for 14 months. It also solidifies Gass' standing as a prime candidate to one day succeed Kevin Mansell as CEO of the $19 billion company, which employs thousands of people at its Menomonee Falls headquarters."It's a good move," analyst Patrick McKeever of MKM Partners said. "I've been pretty impressed by Michelle since she joined the company. She's a rising star and I think it makes sense."In an email, Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird & Co. said he too has been "impressed by the leadership and energy" Gass has brought to Kohl's. The move increases the odds that she will ultimately succeed Mansell, Altschwager said.Kohl's also said Thursday that it has begun an external search for a chief operating officer — a new position for the firm. Whomever is chosen for that role also likely will be an eventual CEO candidate.Many observers had expected Kohl's to announce a new chief merchant months ago. But the decision to go with Gass emerged as the company began embarking on a sweeping series of initiatives it calls the "greatness agenda," Mansell said in an interview.Gass, who has been credited with playing a key role in Starbucks' turnaround of a few years ago, joined Kohl's in June 2013 as the firm was working to rebound from mediocre sales performance and operational missteps.Named chief customer officer, she has overseen e-commerce, marketing and efforts to more fully engage consumers through such measures as a loyalty rewards program that has attracted some 30 million members.As Kohl's searched for a new chief merchant — the executive who oversees the planning, development and allocation of the apparel, home goods and other products sold in the chain's 1,164 department stores and online business — Mansell increasingly saw that role as tightly connected to the work Gass was already spearheading."It became more clear everyday that these two things, customer engagement and product, are linked completely," he said.That pointed toward Gass as a logical person to head up merchandising, and Mansell began seriously weighing that option as long as a year ago. But given Gass' relatively thin experience with department-store retailing, Mansell wanted to make sure she was ready."Michelle has been new to our industry and our sector, so there was a learning curve," Mansell said. Actually, she's not entirely new to the industry. Just before joining Kohl's, she spent four and a half years on the board of Ann Inc., operator of more than 1,000 women's apparel stores under the Ann Taylor and Loft brands.And running Kohl's e-commerce operations for two years has given Gass in-depth knowledge of Kohl's products and supply structure, Mansell said."She's ready for this," he said. "She is more than ready."With comparable-store sales growing the last two quarters after five straight quarters of year-over-year declines, it should be clear that Gass is "making a big difference," Mansell said.Altschwager noted Gass' lack of extensive merchandising experience before joining Kohl's. But he said that with the company's large team of merchandise management and product development executives, "the chief merchant role is more about leadership and strategic direction than having an eye for fashion trends."Gass' new title will be chief merchandising and customer officer. She will retain most of her previous responsibilities, with Mansell taking over digital and e-commerce strategies and operations until a chief operating officer is found.Besides digital technology and e-commerce, the chief operating officer will oversee Kohl's store operations, supply chain and logistics. Like every legacy retailer, Kohl's is looking for the most effective way to appeal to consumers who increasingly tote smartphones and combine online shopping with the traditional brick-and-mortar variety. Placing the same person in charge of both digital and physical-store operations will speed Kohl's progress along that path, Mansell said."It's a different way to structure, but I think it's the future for us," he said.In the merchandising role, Gass replaces Donald Brennan, who resigned in March 2014. He had received a relatively low performance rating for the previous year.Mansell, who is 62 and has been CEO since August 2008, has no plans to retire. But he said that as Kohl's chief executive and chairman of its board of directors, he wants the board to have choices in succession planning."And I want enough time...to evaluate the performance of specific executives," he said.
