US OPEN

August 27, 2002

Tracy Austin
NEW YORK CITY
	WTA:  Thank you all for coming.  I want to introduce  -- obviously, I don't think these women need introduction, Gabriela Sabatini, Tracy Austin, Alexandra Stevenson.  We're here to honor Tracy for her mentor award today.  I'd like to let Gabriela Sabatini say a few words about this program. 
	GABRIELA SABATINI:  Thank you all for coming here and thanks for making me a part of this award.  I think you all know what it's all about.  I'm just here to let you know that I have experienced the same thing.  I worked with a player in the past.  I just want to tell you that it has been a great experience.  I wish I had that when I started to play tennis.  It's just a great guidance, someone with whom you can build a relationship, that can talk to you and ask you questions and you can give advice.  I hope you experienced the same thing.  It's great.  I have to congratulate the Sanex WTA Tour for having this Partners for Success Program.  You know, I hope it continues.  It's a great thing.  You guys, go ahead. 
	ALEXANDRA STEVENSON:  Well, Tracy is my mentor, as you all know.  She actually helped me win my first $50,000 challenger in Midland, Michigan. 
	TRACY AUSTIN:  Yeah, baby. 
	ALEXANDRA STEVENSON:  She has the winning record so far.  This is before I got assigned to her.  She just helped me a lot.  She's a great champion.  I wish I could be like her someday.  We have a lot of history going back.  We both played at the Jack Kramer Club.  We're both from California.  Our moms are very similar.  They have the same values, they're friends.  John Austin was here with me this week at the US Open.  It's a whole family affair.  It's just great that the Sanex WTA assigned me Tracy.  She's been a wonderful mentor.  I know it's going to keep continuing even though I've graduated.  She'll always be there for me.  So thank you very much. 
	TRACY AUSTIN:  Thank you.  Well, when the WTA came to me talking to me about being a mentor, I thought it would be such a unique experience and such a fulfilling experience.  When they came to me and talked about Alexandra, I thought it would be a perfect fit because Alexandra, as she mentioned, had been coming to our area in the South Bay in California for many, many years.  I always loved her game.  I really liked her personality, her bubbly personality.  I thought that she had a strong desire to learn about the game of tennis, the history, and particularly about her game.  She always seemed to want to get more information to try to make her game better.  That was so enjoyable.  We actually worked together for a little bit, a little bit of coaching, whatever.  That was very pleasurable because she worked a hundred percent every single time that we worked.  She wanted to learn.  It's been a very enjoyable experience watching her go from a young kid out there on the court trying to find her way, has had some successes, now more successes in the last year, improving her game so much.  It's really been a very fulfilling experience.  I've enjoyed it.  As she said, I expect this to fully continue.  I feel like we've graduated in the Partners for Success Program on the WTA, but I hope to continue to work with Alexandra on the phone.  You know, it's fun to have somebody that you're working with.  You're always looking in that paper, always making sure how her scores are, how her results are.  It's a great thing.  I came up at 14, you know, with my mom.  She talks about my mom.  We had no idea what we were doing.  We had no idea which tournaments to enter, how many tournaments to play.  There's a zillion and one questions that you would love to be able to ask somebody that's already been there, somebody that you trust.  So I think it's a terrific program.  I'm available for the next one now. 
	WTA:  We'll be calling. 
	TRACY AUSTIN:  I understand now that the WTA is the first one to instill the Partners for Success Program.  Now the NBA, men's basketball, is starting to do that as well.  It's a terrific thing.  If you haven't been there, you don't have the confidence, it's great to have somebody to ask those questions.  I feel that we've been successful and I hope we continue our great relationship for all of Alexandra's career.  Thank you very much.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
