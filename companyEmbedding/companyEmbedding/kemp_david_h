            Schedule a Complimentary Exam 



Initial Exam
	The first appointment with Kemp Orthodontics will be a clinical examination to determine any orthodontic needs you may have. A current panorex x-ray for Dr. Kemp to view during this appointment will be very helpful.  If you have not had a panorex taken in the last year it may be necessary to take on at the time of the appointment so Dr. Kemp can make accurate treatment recommendations.  The cost of the panorex is $90.00.  Usually the appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be developed at this first visit. The exact treatment procedures needed as well as the financial arrangements will be discussed.  Every attempt will be made in our office to make the best use of your time by developing as much of the treatment plan at the first visit.
	
	Sometimes an exact recommendation cannot be made until further diagnostic information is gathered.  In this case appointments for both diagnostic records and a consultation will be scheduled.

Right Age for Orthodontics
Orthodontics is both an art and a science that can benefit  patients of virtually any age.
	The American Association of Orthodontists recommends that all children receive an orthodontic examination at age 7 and even earlier if a problem is discovered by a parent or the family dentist. The timing of orthodontic treatment is extremely important particularly with our younger patients.
	
	Early diagnosis and treatment can help guide facial growth and tooth eruption, and prevent more serious future problems. Kemp Orthodontics’ goal is to reduce treatment time in full braces and to provide the best and most stable results possible. Since no two patients are alike, there is not a specific age that is best to begin treatment. Adolescents that show signs of misalignment of teeth or a dysfunctional jaw or bite are strong candidates for care. It is very typical for adults, no matter what age to experience rotation or misalignment of teeth. At Kemp Orthodontics over 40% of all orthodontic patients are adults. Our recommendation is that you visit Kemp Orthodontics for an initial orthodontic exam and see the difference that a beautiful smile can make for you.

Treatment Coordinators


Susan Lynn
		As a treatment coordinator at Kemp Orthodontics, I have the pleasure of meeting many of our new patients and their families. I enjoy walking them through the process of beginning orthodontic treatment and building excitement about the beautiful smile we will create for them!
		


Terri Bornick
		To me, there is no greater pleasure than making someone smile. At Kemp Orthodontics, I have the pleasure of being one of the first team members to meet our patients. Whether the patients are children or adults, they all come with the same objective, a beautiful smile.  My job is to show them how easy it can be to reach that beautiful smile.
		
		I joined the team of Kemp Orthodontics in July 1998, bringing 18 years of experience in the dental field.  When not at work, I enjoy traveling, gardening, sewing and reading. My husband and I have 3 grown children and 4 wonderful grandchildren.
		


Lisa Beaulieu
		I joined Kemp Orthodontics in April 1988 and have worked in the dental field for 28 years.  As a treatment coordinator, my goal is to educate our patients about their treatment plan and to make them feel comfortable and excited about coming to our office.  I greatly enjoy getting to meet new people every day and building relationships.  It is truly rewarding to be a part of the journey that leads everyone to a healthy beautiful smile and see them smiling with happiness and new confidence.  I am honored to be a part of such an amazing team and appreciate all the time, quality, and dedication that Dr. Kemp puts into each individual patient.
		
		I was born in Franklin, TN and live in Spring Hill, TN.  I recently became engaged to a wonderful man, Brad Thompson, and between us we have 4 beautiful children: Chase, Morgan, Keller, and Tyeler.  I love family time, motorcycling, boating, antique shopping, traveling, and spending time with my friends!  Not to mention I’m a huge Pittsburg Steeler fan.
		

Financial Coordinator

Cindy Smith
		I feel very blessed to be a member of such a wonderful team at Kemp Orthodontics.  I’ve been with Dr. Kemp since 1991 as the financial/insurance coordinator.  I can honestly say it’s truly wonderful to work for someone who cares so deeply for his profession, his patients, and his staff.
		

Appointment Coordinators

Jayne Brien
		I feel that I am privileged to get to talk to and engage with our patients the very first time they call or come into our office.  It is very rewarding to see the end results of their treatment and be able to rejoice with them over their new smiles.  Since I love interacting with people in general, I feel that I am right at home every day at work, and I try to make our patients feel right at home as well.
		
		In my personal time, I love spending time with family and friends as well as traveling when I get the opportunity.  My husband and I will celebrate 38 years of marriage this year. We have four wonderful children and one grandbaby girl whom we are over the moon about!  I also love to bake, take long walks, and see movies when I can.  We are avid Titans, Auburn, and Georgia fans as well.
		


Gail Thomas
		As an Appointment Coordinator, I feel that I am doing something that matters by helping each patient with his or her daily needs.  Meeting everyone with a smile is easy when you work at such a wonderful office. The best part of my day starts as I walk through the office door.
		
		Being in the dental field for more than 20 years, I have worked as a Registered Assistant in General Dentistry, Endodontics, and Oral Surgery. 
		When I am not in our office, you can find me with my two teenagers and my husband, “the cutest boy in the world!”
		

Orthodontic Assistants

Stacy McClure
		I joined Kemp Orthodontics in 1997. I am a Registered Dental Assistant with an x-ray license and have been in the dental field since 1993.  What I love about my job is seeing a patient who comes to us wanting to change his or her smile and then to see how much the final result of treatment changes his or her self-confidence.
		
		I have a daughter and two nephews.  I enjoy camping, swimming, traveling, baking, motorcycle riding, and spending time with my family.
		


Sheryl Brooks
		I joined the Kemp Orthodontics team in 1999.  I have been in the dental field since 1990. I am a Registered Dental Assistant, a certified x-ray technician, and our OSHA Coordinator.  The most rewarding part of my job is the relationships that develop through the care that I have been able to give our patients.  I love to hear their stories and be a part of their lives in a substantial way.  Being able to take part in changing their smiles brings me great joy.  I am very proud to be part of a transformation that can bring joy, self-confidence, and even self-esteem to our patients for a lifetime. I like to think that our patients are an extension of my family.
		
		I am originally from Hawaii. I am married to Christopher and have three children, Kelii, Kamalii, and Kelani. I love a night out: dinner and a movie, swimming, laughing, and being with my family.
		


Vanessa Twomley
		As a registered dental assistant at Kemp Orthodontics, I get to see amazing transformations every day.  Not only do we transform smiles but we also transform lives by giving patients great confidence they need to succeed in day to day activities.  I am proud to be a part of this dental family where together we work towards making our patients feel welcome, comfortable, and proud to smile.
		
		When I am not at work, I love spending time with my wonderful husband Kevin, my family, and adorable pets.  I love to be outdoors, enjoy concerts, movies, home improvements, and cooking.  Moving to Tennessee from New York was the best decision I ever made.
		


Blakely Day
		I graduated from Kaplan College and joined the Kemp Orthodontics team in 2014.  The most enjoyable aspect about my job is the amazing relationships we form with our patients as we help them achieve the beautiful smiles they desire.
		
		I am a Florida native and relocated to Tennessee in 2012.  I live in Fairview with the love of my life and our beautiful daughter, Isabelle.
		


Kimberly Pierman
		I attended dental assisting school because as far back in time as I can remember I have had an obsession with teeth and smiles.  After graduating in 2013, I joined the Kemp Orthodontics team.  I really enjoy seeing the journey of our patients as their beautiful smiles develop.
		

Destiny Hotard
		The most rewarding thing about my job is when I get to remove patients’ braces and see their reactions when they see how beautiful their smiles are.
		
		I joined the Kemp Orthodontics team September 2015.  I am a registered Dental Assistant (RDA) and live in Franklin, TN, but I am originally from LA.  I am engaged to my high school sweetheart, Cody.  My other love is our Yorkie, Hayes.  I enjoy working out and spending time with family and friends
		


Sherry Pope
		I’m the newest member of the Kemp Orthodontics team.  As a recent graduate of the Dental Staff school of TN, I am extremely eager and excited to work with such a great team!
		
		I am also a proud mom to two great kids.  In our spare time we love to go skating, spend time outdoors, watch hockey, and just spend time together.
		

Orthodontic Lab Technicians

Paula Drake
		What I love the most about my position is the opportunity to learn.  Creating specialty appliances for Dr. Kemp’s patients gives me the opportunity to provide a unique experience for each one.  Because our practice is cutting edge, I have the opportunity to train in new techniques.  I have been in the dental field since 1978. I received my RDA and x-ray license in 1994, and in 1995 I joined the Kemp Orthodontics team.
		


Tracy Waggoner
		I have worked at Kemp Orthodontics since the fall of 1992.  I "hide in the lab" making the specialty appliances and fabricating the in-house indirect bonding trays.  I have the pleasure of seeing all the finished results and beautiful smiles.
		
		I started in the orthodontic field the day I got my braces on when I was 14 and my orthodontist asked if I wanted a part time job.  I worked all areas of the office while in high school and college.
		
		I have enjoyed the flexibility of lab work while raising my 3 children. My husband and I are officially empty nesters with our last daughter graduating UTC this May.  We enjoy swimming and playing with our 2 Labrador retrievers, sailing, traveling, and Tennessee football.
		


Tammy Garrett
		I knew Kemp Orthodontics was the place I wanted to work when my son was in treatment. The office always seemed to run smoothly, and I got to experience first-hand the great care that was given to my son.  Now I get to be part of this practice, and I love meeting the new patients and making them feel as comfortable as I felt!
		
		When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. On pretty days, I love to just drive and drive and drive not going to any particular place, but to just enjoy the scenery.

		Seeing the joy on our patients’ faces when their treatment is finished and they first see their new beautiful smiles is wonderful.
		
		Outside of work, I enjoy spending hours in Grimey’s, exploring Nashville, and playing Dragons and Pirates with my 3-year-old nephew.  He’s definitely my whole world.
