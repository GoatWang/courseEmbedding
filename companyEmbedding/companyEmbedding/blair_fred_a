The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Product Information

        Long before look-alike fast food chains, small roadside cafes like these catered to travelers and truck drivers along the nation's major two-lane highways. Here and there, a few still survive today. Packed with details, the kit includes a laser-cut floor, aged sidewalks and exterior walls featuring laser-etched nail holes. Plastic windows are included, along with signs, burglar bars, lampshades, a cast metal smokejack, plus laser-cut OPEN and EAT signs for the finishing touch.
