It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]

In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002.

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial solutions and financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage and real estate services.[3]
Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

      To whom it may concern
    

      July 27, 2017
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (Securities Code: 8309 TSE, NSE) Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd.
    

      Notice regarding Basic Policy for the Split and Integration of Asset Management Functions
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (President: Tetsuo Ohkubo) hereby announces that it has decided on the basic policy for the split of asset management functions from Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (President: Masaru Hashimoto, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST"), and the integration of aforementioned functions with the related Group company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd. (President: Hideki Hiraki, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST AM") (the "Business Split and Integration"), with the purpose of strengthening the asset management business, which is positioned as a growth business for the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group.
    

      Further, as a preparatory step for the Business Split and Integration, we will segregate as a business within the company, the asset management business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the split and integration, and we will commence concrete initiatives, beginning with formulation of growth strategies.
    


          Background to the Business Split and Integration
        

          With the continued harsh asset management environment of low interest rates worldwide, and increasing price volatility in a wide-range of assets, etc., for clients of all sizes, from individuals and corporations to institutional investors, there are increasing expectations on asset management companies to provide stable and high-quality investment returns, and the provision of products that contribute to future asset-formation primarily through medium- to long-term investment has become an important social mission for asset management companies.
        

          In addition, as a further social mission, asset management companies are urged to contribute to Japan's economic growth through sophistication of the investment chain, by providing growth capital through asset management products and making sustainable improvements to corporate value through constructive dialogue.
        

          In order to meet these expectations, SuMi TRUST, which has been providing services for corporate and institutional investors for many years, will split its asset management functions, which
        

          feature high-level know-how and quality, and strategically integrate aforementioned functions with SuMi TRUST AM, which has been aiming to expand its business from individual investors, focusing on defined contribution pensions, fund wraps, and index trusts, etc. We aim to concentrate and proactively allocate our management resources to growth areas.
        



          Vision for the New Company
        

          As a new asset management company that boasts of being among the largest in scale in Japan, the new company will focus on development of asset management products that will allow clients to entrust, with peace of mind, their medium- to long-term asset formation, and will aim to be an asset management company that has nationally well-known brand power, with recognition from many clients that "SuMi TRUST AM is the most reliable partner in medium- to long-term investment".
        

          The new company will aim to thoroughly strengthen its asset management capabilities, and it will be equipped with an extensive line-up that is responsive to the broad-range of investor needs, and will pursue the maximization of client profits by responding swiftly to the various client needs.
        

          Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group, as a financial group specialized in trust banking, has as its management philosophy, the fulfillment of "trustee's responsibilities" - which are the origin of fiduciary duties. In this specific matter of the split and integration of the asset management business, in order to contribute to business conduct that is still more thoroughly client-oriented, and the improvement of management independence and transparency, the new company intends to continue to enhance its corporate governance framework through measures such as, for example, actively inviting external experts with high-level knowledge to serve as independent external directors.
        



          Schedule for the Business Split and Integration
        


      For the Business Split and Integration, we will, effective on August 1, 2017, implement business segregation within the company regarding the asset management operations relating to the fiduciary services business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the integration, and we will commence concrete preparations.
    

      Based on detailed review and discussions, and subject to matters such as necessary resolutions of the board of directors and the shareholder of each company, and filings with the relevant Japanese and overseas authorities, and approvals, we will aim for integration during Fiscal Year 2018.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

																									Japan Post Bank plans a joint venture with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and Nomura to offer low-risk personal finance products at post offices.
								
																																	
								








TOKYO -- Japan Post Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank and Nomura Holdings plan to form an asset management company that would develop low-risk personal finance products for sale at post offices.     The three have reached a broad agreement on the joint venture -- the first between the government-owned Japan Post group and major private-sector financial institutions -- and may announce their plans this month.     The alliance is in part aimed at helping bridge the divide between the postal group and private-sector banks, which have long accused it of crowding them out, ahead of this fall's initial public offering of shares in Japan Post Holdings and its banking and insurance units.     Japan Post Bank likely would put up half of their new company's several hundred million yen in initial capital, with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust and the Nomura group contributing roughly 30% and 20%, respectively. The three have informed financial regulators of their plans, which call for launching the company next year.     Japanese post offices already sell various mutual funds and other investment products. The joint venture would seek to cater to an underserved segment of customers preferring safe, deposit-like vehicles for their money. It also would offer personal defined-contribution retirement savings plans and wrap accounts, which let investors delegate the management of their portfolios. Sales of these products would begin at select locations and eventually expand nationwide.     Japan Post Bank sees the venture as a launchpad for an asset management business with access to a network of 24,000 post offices. It hopes to ride a shift in personal finance from savings to investment being promoted by the government and seized on by private-sector financial institutions. The bank is trying to show investors that its strategy for post-IPO growth points in this direction.     Nomura Holdings, the parent of Nomura Securities, hopes the venture will broaden its own retail customer base by creating new investors. It can contribute know-how on explaining financial products to beginners. For the past few years, its sales efforts have emphasized building assets over the medium to long term rather than earning sales commissions, and its assets under management have grown.     Sumitomo Mitsui Trust sees joining forces with the postal group as a way to level the playing field with Japan's three megabanks, which boast far bigger branch networks. It brings strength in product development that draws on years of experience managing corporate pensions.
