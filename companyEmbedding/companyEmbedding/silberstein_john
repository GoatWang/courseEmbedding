But what may come as a surprise is that reading to dogs is gaining popularity as a way of addressing concerns about children's reading.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience.

She has low muscle tone which may be responsible for her reflexes not coming in correctly (yet) she has trouble sitting, she can be put in a sitting position but eventually tires and falls without protecting herself. She can't weight bare on her legs (like she wont pull to stand - via a pull to sit thats as far as she will try) and she wont stand while you hold her weight. The paed also says she gets sicker more than you'd expect (tonsilitis, followed by a cold, then blocked tear duct, conjunctivitis and then the flu resulting in sinusitis and bad nappy rash on her girl parts that made them bleed!) She has trouble gaining weight also but is gaining about 100gm a month, her length and hc have slowed down a lot now too but that seems sort of normal (her weight is under the 3rd line on the book charts but the HC and Length are dropping only slightly from 70-50 ish) The paed is particularly concerned she is not meeting milestones and getting further away from the normal stages, as in at 11m she is no where near even commando crawling. She also (don't hate me...) sleeps a lot... 12-16 hrs overnight (the 16 being when she is ill) and sleeps often here and there in the day for another 2-3hrs in total. When ill she can sleep up to 20hrs a day!

We've found Dr Silberstein to be very thorough, but we were warned by our GP about his slightly unusual manner.  You can pretty much see him thinking and running over all the options in his mind and he can come across as indecisive if you aren't aware of it.We did have some admin issues with his rooms not receiving test results and with him not sending a referral, then sending it with some incorrect information, it was eventually worked out but not without a big delay in the tests we needed.  At the time I checked with 2 GPs I highly respect as to whether there was anyone else they'd recommend and they both said he was the one we needed to see.  We were dealing with seizures.I'm glad you've managed to get a quicker appointment, any wait is too long when you are worried about your child and with the severe shortage in paed neuros in WA it's only getting worse.

We see Simon Williams through PMH for our child's Epilepsy & other developmental issues. He is fantastic. We have been very happy with his manner & how thorough he is.Not sure if he can be seen privately.I know there is also a lady Dr Lakshmi Nagarajan whom is very good too. Im sure you can see her privatelyGood LuckYour child's development sound very much like my child.

Thank goodness I've come across this. My DS is almost 6 months and we've been seeing a physio since he was 2 months on recommendation from the health nurse after looking at his arm movement. Our physio has then referred us to a paed, who we've seen twice and he now is organising a private appt for us with one of the PMH neurologists. I'm assuming the waiting list for public is huge and I'd like to get DS seen this year if possible! Our paed first thought he had Erb's Palsy but had never seen it in both sides and he also thought it was only his shoulders that didn't seem to work. DS has never raised his arms above his head. So he spoke to the neuro who suggested a couple of things but we all think it's best if he's checked out further. I'm stressing big time as to what it could be!

QUOTE I'm assuming the waiting list for public is huge and I'd like to get DS seen this year if possible!Not always, my son was in within 6 days - no waiting really. It really depends though on what the issues are and if tests have found anything - our MRI found something that could have been a huge issue if not seen ASAP - as soon as the pead faxed the mri report to the 2 neuros (one in Brisbane and one Sydney - we live inbetween the 2), both rang in 1 hour to request we be there Monday morning for admitting - so we even got to chose who we went with.It can be handy while waiting for your appointment to have as many tests done beforehand like head/spine MRIs and blood tests - if something comes up your appointment will be brought forward - plus alot of the time they will request these on the first appointment if its not already done.

Also, as Lollipopp got me to do, when your appointments are made ask them if there is a cancellation list and have your child put on them.  DS still wouldn't have had his MRI if we hadn't known about that and I'd still be worried.  Instead we have a repeat EEG in a couple of weeks and I'm keeping everything crossed he's grown out of his issues.

But the problem is with things like MRI's that at the younger ages they need General Anaesthetic and not sure I'd be pushing for that with out an exp'd Dr recommending it. Depends on how serious it is. In our case she is fine but delayed and early intervention is obviously best and we would like to know what is causing if anything is that might be fixable/treatable etc. Lots different to a life threatening condition which we don't expect

Wild mum, that is the decision we had to weigh up as well, but after abnormal EEG results 2 years in a row Dr S decided the GA was warranted. It wasnt a long anaesthetic and he woke quickly afterwards. The peace of mind the MRI results provided made it worth it. The wait list for the MRI is huge, so even if you think you may want it done start looking into it now.

Can anyone help with feedback on Dr Peter Walsh (Neurologist) ?
I am so grateful to have been able to get an appointment:)
I have a child with Auto Immune Issues.
Our alternative was to wait for Dr Silberstein for 2015 
Would be most grateful for any feedback from anyone who has seen him before?

Auto immune issues? Wouldn't you be better with a rheumatologist?

I saw both the Silberstiens and I can safely say I would never go back.
Phillipa Lamont is who we see now.

Again though they usually don't deal with auto immune issues (arthritis, lupus, allergies, asthma etc etc)

How dogs could make children better readers
Issues around children learning to read are rarely out of the news. Which is hardly surprising – becoming a successful reader is of paramount importance in improving a child's life chances. Nor is it surprising that reading creates a virtuous circle: the more you read the better you become. But what may come as a surprise is that reading to dogs is gaining popularity as a way of addressing concerns about children's reading.


 

Mum's warning about 'creeps' on popular teen app
Just when you thought it was totally safe to let your kids on social media (just kidding, nobody really thinks that), here comes another warning of ways creeps will try to contact our kids.


 

Let preschoolers invent their own spelling, experts say
Find out how to help your child in the light of the new findings.


 

Do your kids get too many presents? There's an app for that
Three out of four Australians believe they are overspending on their kids by hundreds of dollars each month. And then there's the gifts.

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
