Josh Neblett with etailz co-founders Sarah Wollnick and Tom Simpson. (Photos via etailz.)Josh Neblett, co-founder and CEO of technology and retail company etailz, has grown what started as a college business plan into a $100 million company. In his senior year at Gonzaga University, Neblett stepped off his path towards becoming a financial adviser to jump into the world of entrepreneurship and e-commerce.
Having grown up in Seattle, Neblett put down roots in Spokane, Wash., in 2008, where he and his wife, Sarah Wollnick co-founded etailz with noted angel investor Tom Simpson, who was Neblett’s entrepreneurship professor at Gonzaga University.

“We decided the best place to grow and build the company was going to be Spokane. It has such a quality of life over here, where you don’t have the traffic and the rain,” said Neblett, now 29 years old. “Seattle has a ton to offer, but there is just a different dynamic over here that is really unique.”

The original brand, greencupboards.com, became etailz in March of 2013 following the acquisition of ecomom.com. Etailz now operates five niche websites and three storefronts including greencupboards.com, which maintains the eco-friendly focus it was founded upon.
With 130 employees, etailz continues to grow. Sales have jumped from $435,000 in 2009 to a projected $100 million in 2015, according to the company. Neblett says that leveraging the company’s partnership with Amazon has been fundamental to that growth.
Neblett views a large portion of his role as CEO as a “moderator of mood,” a feat he has tackled with an open office environment and weekly office-wide boating excursions on Lake Coeur D’Alene.
Neblett received his bachelors in business administration in 2008 and his MBA in entrepreneurship in 2010 from Gonzaga. He has been awarded Spokane’s 30 under 30, catalyst’s Emerging Innovator of the Year, and was a finalist for Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year.

Tell me about yourself. “I grew up over on the west side, in Seattle, and came over to school at Gonzaga. I was lined up to be a financial advisor and take over my dad’s business, and then in my senior year of college I took a class called ‘Creating New Ventures’ which was my first formal introduction to entrepreneurship. That is how the original company started. I decided I’d try this whole entrepreneurial thing out. I think I have the few loose screws in the head necessary to pursue such a venture.”
Neblett driving a boat on an outing with employees.

What do you like to do for fun? “We have a boat and always go out to Lake Coeur d’Alene and take the employees out on the boat. So that’s something we like to do for fun a lot. I like to play basketball, I love sports, I love all things competitive. Back in the day I used to play poker. There are some weird dynamics and interesting similarities between entrepreneurship and poker players and their thought processes. I don’t have the time to play so much anymore.”
How did etailz begin? “I remember going home on winter break and saying to my parents, ‘I know I have this really lucrative opportunity to take over dad’s business and be a financial advisor and that’s what I have gone to school for, but I’ve got a better idea. What if I go and start a company in this industry I really know nothing about, I’ll make next to nothing, and we will see what happens.’ And they kind of looked at me funny but supported me through it. The day after break ended, I showed up on the adjunct professors’ doorstep because he was a venture capitalist and said ‘Hey what do you think if we get this thing started, we won a business plan competition, we have some momentum, let’s actually give it a shot.’ That first year we made $5000 in sales, and our most popular product was a toilet bowl cleaner. Over time we just learned, adapted, and moved quickly, and eventually got to where we are today.”
 That first year we made $5000 in sales, and our most popular product was a toilet bowl cleaner. Over time we just learned, adapted, and moved quickly, and eventually got to where we are today.
How would you explain your business to someone who doesn’t know what it is? “At the end of the day, we are pretty complex in our approach, but the overall business is very simple. We are a retailer. We essentially find and curate really cool products and sell them online. But the way we do it with the level of technology, data, software and all the complexities is what makes us unique. We are one of Amazon’s biggest merchants and biggest partners, and so that allows us to focus on the supplier, curating products, building software and building technology, and less on customer acquisition as you would as a standard retailer.”
What has been the biggest learning experience so far? “How my role has changed and adapted. Early on … it was just me in the back of a hallway with Sarah, sitting around doing customer service, studying up relationships, doing accounting, really the jack-of-all-trades to some degree. And with time as you grow, now that we are 130 employees, you have to get better at delegating. I heard someone once say that a CEO’s job is a moderator of the mood and architect of the future and I’ve really embraced that. For me it’s been a real transition because early on you are always taught if you want something done right, do it yourself. My job now is to make sure that the culture is right, that people understand what we are trying to build here. Make sure that the mood is in line with something that is going to allow us to grow. And then come up with the ideas and implement the ideas that will allow us to continue to grow.”
What are you looking toward for the future of the company? “Every year we do something different. We move quickly, learn, and adapt. That is our mindset when it comes to innovation and growing the business. In terms of the future, our goal and our initiative has always been to become the next wave of commerce. You don’t hear a lot about marketplace focused merchants, but we believe you can build a compelling model to be the worlds’ biggest merchant on what will be the worlds’ biggest marketplace. That has been our focus over the last few years, and we are excited about the potential of that.”

Josh Neblett set out to be a financial advisor but discovered that he was a little too attracted to risk.
Rather than return home to Seattle in 2008 to assume his father’s enviable book at Edward D. Jones, the Gonzaga MBA graduate stayed in Spokane and rolled the dice on his award-winning business plan, a proposed e-commerce supplier of green home products. He hatched the idea with Sarah Wollnick, his high school sweetheart and now his wife.

Etailz Inc. expects to top $100 million in sales in 2015, up from $27 million in 2013, on the wings of what it expects will be “a big, hairy audacious December,” says Neblett. The company made Inc. 500’s Fastest Growing Businesses list in 2013 and 2014.
Originally named Greencupboard, the company circled the drain the first year, raising $288,000 in start-up capital, but recording just $5,000 in revenue, mostly on toilet cleaner sales. His college professor, Tom Simpson, an angel investor, had thrown his hat in the ring and became a co-founder.
“We knew we had to fix it, and we knew we had to fix it fast,” says Neblett, 29.




They realized that their most important customers were not the consumers who bought the products, but the suppliers who provided them. Etailz resolved to be the company that solved supplier problems.
Today Etailz has 119 full-time employees and two storefront locations, and represents 2,300 suppliers on Amazon, eBay and its own websites. Its wide product range includes home, electronics, baby and pet. Its alliance with top e-commerce sites eliminates shipping hassles. To date it has taken only about $1.5 million in outside funding.
“The company that wins this market space will be the company that provides the best technology and software solutions,” says Neblett.
Neblett says he is “ultra-competitive” and expects the same in his workforce. “Fun comes second.”
His goal?
“Becoming the industry leader has a lot of appeal to me,” says Neblett. “We’ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg.”

Although Neblett and Wollnick are Seattle natives, they prefer the dry climate and reduced traffic in Spokane. They are also bolstered by community support.
“In Seattle, we would have been just another start-up technology and retail company. In Spokane, we’re a poster child for success,” says Neblett.

Etailz CEO Josh Neblett says acquisition was months in making, won’t affect Spokane company’s operations

Etailz acquisition at a glanceTrans World Entertainment Corp. is paying $75 million in cash and stock for Spokane-based etailz Inc. Trans World operates more than 300 F.Y.E. entertainment media stores and Suncoast movie and film memorabilia stores. Etailz operates five niche websites and specializes in helping brands sell online. It sells around 30,000 products worldwide, including through Amazon.Etailz has about 150 employees in its corporate offices and about 40 more in its distribution warehouse in Spokane Valley.


The $75 million sale of Spokane-based etailz Inc. announced last week was in the works for months, but the owners had to keep it quiet. And that proved challenging for CEO and co-founder Josh Neblett.
“I tend to be overly transparent with the employees. Really, they know everything that’s going on,” Neblett said at the etailz headquarters in the University District. “They didn’t know this was going on, and they couldn’t with a publicly held company and all that.”
On  Monday after the close of the stock market, the 190-some employees of the e-commerce and marketing company gathered to hear about the acquisition by Trans World Entertainment Corp., a New York-based retailer specializing in video, music, pop culture and electronics products. Trans World’s stock trades on the Nasdaq exchange.
Revealing the big news was liberating from the “deal fatigue” that built up over the past nine months, Neblett said. “Being able to let everyone know so that they could share in the excitement, that was a sense a relief from that anxiety,” he said.
It was important to assure the team “that we were still going to operate as etailz, we were still going to accomplish the goals that we set forth,” he said. “We just now have the opportunity to accelerate that growth and to tap into resources we never had previously.”
Etailz will stay put, including the company headquarters in the McKinstry Innovation Center along the Spokane River, a warehouse in the Spokane Business and Industrial Park and the Wollnick’s retail store downtown.
“The plan is to stay in Spokane, grow out our infrastructure, grow out our team. There’s a wealth of talent here,” Neblett said.
“The quality of life and cost of living and all the things that Spokane has to offer are really tough to replace,” he continued. “So there’s no reason for them to want to move us. For this deal, I think as much as anything this was about talent acquisition for them. We have a very talented team, and they know that.”Technology increasingly important in retailThe business has grown rapidly in the eight years since Neblett launched it with Sarah Wollnick, now his wife, and Gonzaga University adjunct professor Tom Simpson, their angel investor. As Gonzaga students, Neblett and Wollnick won the school’s Hogan Entrepreneurial Business Plan Competition in 2008 with their pitch for what then was called Green Cupboards, an online seller of eco-friendly products.
“One of the things that has made us get to this point is our ability to pivot along the way. The only thing that’s consistent from our original business plan is we sell product online,” Neblett said.
Likewise, Trans World has had to pivot, he said, as consumers have migrated to digital downloads and streaming music and movies.
“The leaders in tomorrow’s retail will be those with the best technology solutions,” he said. “We’re still at the very infancy of what this all can become. And that’s what gets us excited. I think that’s what Spokane also should be excited about.”
Dan Stewart, a Gonzaga University professor of entrepreneurship and director of the school’s Hogan Entrepreneurial Leadership Program, applauds the company for the impact it has had on the area’s economic development.
“We’re super excited they made that conscious decision to stay in Spokane,” Stewart said. “We have a retention problem with some of our graduates that they don’t feel like there’s career opportunities. As much as we would like to keep our graduates here, they go where they perceive the jobs to be.”They’re good at bricks; etailz is good at clicksTrans World has over 300 F.Y.E. entertainment media stores and Suncoast movie and film memorabilia stores. Etailz operates five niche websites and specializes in helping brands sell online. It sells around 30,000 products, including through Amazon.
“They’re really good at brick and mortar; we’re really good at e-commerce and marketplace,” Neblett said. “We think there’s an opportunity to combine those two specialties into something that’s bigger.”
But etailz will continue to operate autonomously and grow its brand, Neblett said. “They’re going to continue to grow the F.Y.E. brand. And we’re going to tap into each others’ resources to grow,” he said.
Etailz has about 150 employees crammed into its corporate offices and about 40 more in its distribution warehouse in Spokane Valley.
“We still need all our support people, we still need our process, we still need everything to help us grow. So everything stays in place,” Neblett said.
Etailz sells worldwide and keeps inventory in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom as well.
Neblett, who just turned 30, will remain in his role and report directly to Trans World CEO Mike Feurer. Wollnick will continue to oversee the etailz partner relations team, which works with over 2,000 suppliers. Simpson, their entrepreneurship professor at Gonzaga, has served as chairman of the board and now will serve as a consultant to Trans World.
Feurer is a former executive at Coldwater Creek, the Sandpoint-based women’s clothing retailer that went out of business in 2014. He and Neblett met at a consumer technology trade show, and Feurer reached out to Neblett last year to say he kept hearing about etailz and wanted to learn more.
“So he actually came Spokane, and we sat down and talked for a while. That was almost nine  months ago,” Neblett said. “From there on it was starting to create a vision around what could be. As we continued down that path it got more and more exciting, and the potential seemed more and more apparent that it made a lot of sense for both sides.”
Neblett said he wanted to be sure the partnership would benefit the long-term success of etailz.
“I’ve always said we’re not building this company to sell, we’re building this company to be an industry leader, to be sustainable, to be here 20 years from now,” he said.
He wasn’t shopping around for a buyer but said he always has explored partnerships in building the business.
“This was no different,” he said. “The acquisition was all that could make sense, because this was a dynamic of retail to retail, and if you’re in a retail-to-retail relationship you need to likely be a wholly owned subsidiary. You can’t partner in any other way, in my opinion.”
Breaking the news to employees this week no doubt filled many of them with apprehension, Neblett acknowledged.
“A lot of these people have gone through acquisitions before, which haven’t gone how this one is going to go,” he said. “I think everyone feels good about it.”Outgrowing space in McKinstry buildingNeblett said he and Wollnick, who live in Otis Orchards, have no other immediate plans in light of the sale, which included cash, stock shares and future earnings based on company performance.
“From a business standpoint, I’m locked in. We’re barely scraping the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We think we can do a lot more. So no, I’m not thinking about opening up a restaurant or starting some new technology company. Will I in the future? Maybe. My focus is fully on executing on the vision here.”
As etailz continues to grow, it likely will need a larger space than what it occupies in the McKinstry building, where 15 months remain on the company’s lease. The prime location has worked well, Neblett said, but “we’re exploring everywhere from downtown to Liberty Lake for opportunities for us to expand into.”
The company’s move into the McKinstry building in 2012, when its workforce was at 50, dovetailed with “an intellectual hotbed of entrepreneurship” there, said Gonzaga’s Stewart.
“I think they’ve just become the core of a new entrepreneurial energy in this area,” he said.
“We make a point to walk our students over there so they can see the space and just absorb some of that culture,” Stewart said. “They love to go over there and hear the story and see the environment. It’s my way of telling them there’s hope for you to have a career here.”

 Six years ago, Josh Neblett was finishing work on a finance degree at Gonzaga University when he experienced a classic “light bulb moment.” 
In his case, the light bulb was energy efficient.
After winning a business competition among area colleges, Neblett and his future wife, Sarah Wollnick, together with venture capitalist Tom Simpson launched GreenCupboards, an online retailer of eco-friendly products. 
Since then, the company has rebranded itself etailz to reflect its rapidly expanding line of merchandise, and added ecomom.com, everyCasa.com and Wollnick’s, a retail store at 1025 S. Perry St.
Last year, etailz was No. 127 on Inc. magazine’s list of fastest-growing private U.S. companies, with $24 million in sales. Neblett hopes to double etailz’s revenue this year.
The CEO discussed his company’s evolution and goals during a recent interview at etailz’s corporate headquarters in the McKinstry Innovation Center just south of GU’s campus.
 S-R: Where did you grow up? 
 Neblett: South of Seattle, in Yelm (pop. 6,965). 
 S-R: What were your interests? 
 Neblett: I enjoyed sports, and the idea of selling things. In high school I started a little eBay business devoted to sports cards and memorabilia I’d collected. 
 S-R: What career did you envision for yourself? 
 Neblett: Financial advising. I intended to take over my dad’s brokerage business. 
 S-R: Why did you choose to attend Gonzaga? 
 Neblett: I learned about it through the basketball team. Once I started looking into the business school and the university as a whole, it seemed like the right fit for me. 
 S-R: What led to your starting your own business? 
 Neblett: I took a class called Creating New Ventures taught by adjunct professor Tom Simpson. I expected it to be more or less a glorified science project. But then we won a business-plan competition that included Gonzaga, Eastern, Whitworth and WSU, and that gave us the credibility to raise $288,000 and launch GreenCupboards. 
 S-R: Were you personally interested in green products back then? 
 Neblett: Sarah was more into that – things like organic makeup. I was more focused on the sales side of business, and saw an opportunity. I believed if we made buying a green product easy for people and offered it at a price comparable to the alternative, most people would choose the sustainable option. 
 S-R: How do you compete with Web giants such as Amazon Green? 
 Neblett: Amazon is our biggest competition – one-third of all online retail transactions happen on Amazon. But we look at marketplaces like Amazon and eBay more as partners than competitors, because we leverage their expertise to sell our products. 
 S-R: How can you compete on price? 
 Neblett: Of the 1,700 suppliers we work with, I’d say we’re among the top three retailers for 50 percent of them. Sometimes we’re their biggest account. 
 S-R: Did you have a mentor? 
 Neblett: Tom (Simpson), who co-founded the company with Sarah and me, has very much been my mentor throughout this process. 
 S-R: What lessons have proved most useful? 
 Neblett: One of his catch phrases that I keep in mind is “Only the paranoid survive,” because online retail is so competitive. Another is “Get out of the wheat and into the sky.” As my role has evolved from developing a business model to building a world-class team, I’ve needed to delegate more and set aside enough time to plan for the company’s next step. 
 S-R: Was the business successful from the start? 
 Neblett: We don’t like to use the word “successful” – again, that paranoid attitude. We’re profitable and self-sustaining, and on pace to be successful. But I wouldn’t consider us successful today. 
 S-R: How long did it take GreenCupboards to turn a profit? 
 Neblett: Two years. But we weren’t killing ourselves in the meantime. The typical model in online retail is to raise tens of millions of dollars, and then lose money for years as you try to acquire market share. That worked for drugstore.com and diapers.com, but you don’t hear about the 99 percent that it didn’t work for. 
 S-R: You launched your company just as the economy was sinking into recession. Did that worry you? 
 Neblett: Some of the best success stories in history have come from companies that were started as the economy was sinking. 
 S-R: Give me a for instance? 
 Neblett: Uh … I’ll email you a couple. 
 S-R: Did you ever worry that GreenCupboards might fail? 
 Neblett: Of course. Total sales during our first six months were $5,000. Our top seller was a toilet bowl cleaner. 
 S-R: What have been some milestones? 
 Neblett: Last year we acquired a competitor called ecomom.com. They had launched in 2008 and gone down that model I described – raised $12 million or $14 million and essentially squandered it. When we absorbed them, it made sense to rebrand our corporate name to etailz to reflect our growing array of products beyond those that meet our stringent criteria for green. And etailz is generic enough that it can be an umbrella for new divisions, new companies, new ideas. 
 S-R: What do you like most about your job? 
 Neblett: I love the craziness. Entrepreneurs need a few loose screws in the head, and I definitely think I have those. I love coming to work each day and then going home and still working. 
 S-R: What do you like least? 
 Neblett: A lot of people wouldn’t like the constant change, the quick decisions – our ready-fire-aim approach. But back in the day, when IBM was the industry leader, they had so many layers of bureaucracy that they’d waste months weighing decisions that sounded good the day someone came up with them. Our ready-fire-aim mentality lets us move quickly, learn and adapt. 
 S-R: Your mission statement mentions three goals: to sustain, amaze and delight. What’s an example of amaze? 
 Neblett: You amaze the customer by overdelivering – by doing something above and beyond what they expect, such as refunding their shipping fee if a product arrives later than expected. And our customers aren’t just the consumers; we obsess just as much on our suppliers – how we can help them grow their sales. 
 S-R: How do you decide which products to carry? 
 Neblett: We look at our key competitors’ best sellers – which categories are hot. And we go to a lot of trade shows to find up-and-coming products that fit our niche. 
 S-R: What do you look for when hiring? 
 Neblett: First and foremost, you have to fit our culture. If you don’t, I don’t care how smart you are. 
 S-R: How would you characterize that culture? 
 Neblett: Fun, dynamic, entrepreneurial. Some people are better suited for a 9-to-5 bank job, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But we need people who are going to stay up late and get up early thinking about work – how they can make something better. And they need to enjoy coming to the office and not be a Debbie Downer. 
 S-R: Are most of your employees young? 
 Neblett: Relatively. The average age has risen as we’ve hired more managers. Also, the fact that our earliest employees were 22 when we hired them, and now they’re 27, 28, 29 – it’s rising that way. 
 S-R: Are you planning to hire more employees this year? 
 Neblett: We’re in nonstop hiring mode. We currently have 15 job postings. 
 S-R: Do you see etailz as a buyout candidate? 
 Neblett: Not really. I believe building the company to sell would lead to bad decisions. We’re planning to be here 10 or 20 years from now. It’s naive to say a strategic partnership or acquisition couldn’t happen, but it’s not something we spend any time focusing on. 
 S-R: What would it cost to start a business like this today? 
 Neblett: The marketplace has changed so rapidly that I’m not sure you could build a website like ours today unless you were willing to start out losing millions of dollars. 
 S-R: What do your parents think of your career? 
 Neblett: I showed up during winter break from school and said, “I don’t know anything about e-commerce or retail. I know I have a highly lucrative job waiting for me if I want to take over the broker business. And this other thing isn’t going to pay me anything. But I think I can run with it.” And they were very supportive. 
 S-R: Did they offer any advice? 
 Neblett: My mom comes from the world of education, so she said, “If you want to continue to get our support, you have to get your MBA while starting the company.” 
 S-R: Did you get your MBA? 
 Neblett: I did 90 percent the first year. I only have one class left now, and the reason I’ve postponed finishing is because I still have access to the (Gonzaga) gym and can play basketball with the guys a couple of days a week. Once you graduate, you can’t get in anymore.

Profiles The 2016 Executive Excellence Awards: Josh Neblett




Cofounder & CEO, Etailz Inc.
BY: Gianni Truzzi
 | FROM THE PRINT EDITION | 
February 2016
 








Executive Excellence AwardsEtailz  



What has rapidly become a thriving, supplier-focused online retailer was built on the foundation of another dream. Josh Neblett confesses that his initial venture, GreenCupboards.com, was a “glorified science project” in its effort to develop and sell environmentally friendly household products online. After raising $288,000 in investment, it booked only $5,000 in sales its first year.
Neblett learned, however, that he could help solve the kinds of problems his suppliers were experiencing. “Suppliers aren’t treated as a customer by a retailer,” he explains. “They’re often squeezed.” After changing GreenCupboards’ name to Etailz in 2013, the 29-year-old graduate of Gonzaga University and his cofounder and former professor, Tom Simpson, now help more than 2,300 suppliers with their sales on Amazon, eBay and through their own curated websites.
Instead of chemists, Neblett hires software developers to create cloud-based tools to help optimize brand performance. From its headquarters in Spokane, Etailz seeks to become the industry expert on sales through online marketplaces. The company, which employs 119 full-time workers, has seen annual sales grow from $435,000 in 2009 to an anticipated $100 million in 2015.
Not even the internet can contain Neblett’s retailing energy: Etailz has opened three brick-and-mortar stores in downtown Spokane to complement online sales. GreenCupboards continues to operate as a brand under the Etailz umbrella — ecomom.com is another — providing an ongoing reminder of its ambitious beginning.“That bootstrap mentality,” Neblett notes, “allowed us to continue and innovate.”

“It’s not all about shopping … we try to impart our own witty, receptive and youthful office culture to anyone who clicks-in.”
February 11, 2012 - 
			Josh Neblett



 


This interview was made possible by our friends at DomainNameSales.com:

 
The marketplace for domain names.
GreenCupboards.com was co-founded by students, Josh Neblett and Sarah Wollnick with professor Tom Simpson, after winning the Spokane Regional University Business Plan Competition while attending Gonzaga University. They want to be your green-living guides for the eco-savvy trailblazer within. Their goal is to provide you with accurate and useful information to aid your transition to more sustainable living.
GreenCupboards.com is an online retailer of environmentally friendly products for homes and businesses. The company differentiates itself by offering a vast array of products, pursuing multiple channels of distribution, providing exquisite customer service and serving as a source of intriguing content.

MO: What has the evolutionary process of GreenCupboards.com been from winning a competition for best business plan to actually putting your business model into practice? Were there any major differences or changes in how your idea looked on paper to what it was like to actually implement in the real world?
Josh: To say the least, going from a homework assignment to business plan to marketplace hasn’t been without its hurdles. Originally, we bundled products together in “cupboards” for kitchens, bathrooms and pets; assortments we thought would be useful to customers. However, we quickly discovered that customers preferred to pick and choose products rather than buying a parcel of what we thought would work for them. We’re continually changing, reforming and adapting to customer needs (yes, this even involves tweaking our own workflow), so our evolution consists of regular modification to make the GreenCupboards.com shopping experience variety-filled, educational and user friendly.
MO: How hard was it to put together such an impressive network of environmentally friendly and sustainable products on such a large scale?
Josh: Compiling an extensive variety of eco-friendly products has been a collaborative effort on behalf of the entire GreenCupboards.com team. While product research is undertaken by our Green Compliance and Competition Committees, we encourage employees to keep their eyes open for new, innovative “green” products to add to our repertoire. Our supplier relations team attends annual conferences and trade shows, hence a yearly fluctuation in what we add to our stockpile. Our wide array of products (over 18,000 sku’s) plays a large role in our goal of becoming a market leader, so expanding our product web is part of the jet fuel behind our development. This conglomerate approach also encourages personnel to engage in proprietorship of what we sell alongside continual efforts to diversify the products we would like to offer in the future … call it our affinity for looking forward.
MO: Where does your passion for the green movement come from? Were you raised to be environmentally conscious or was it more of spotting a great opportunity in a niche market?
Josh: I’d say it’s a mixture of both. The practice of recycling and buying low-impact goods is appealing. Our office recycles and (depending on the weather) the majority of our employee’s bike, walk, carpool or use public transit to commute. It just makes sense to take care of the planet. Riding on the recent eco-consciousness wave, we identified the large and growing demand for one-stop shopping for an exceptional variety of eco-friendly products and leapt at the opportunity.
MO: GreenCupboards.com is experiencing impressive growth and profitability. How have you managed to gain such serious traction since launching in 2008 and why do you think that the trend towards a greener lifestyle is gaining serious momentum?
Josh: To be sure, the use of multiple marketplaces boosts our web presence. It’s hard to pin the exact reason greener living is catching on so quickly. While the trend may be due to media attention on environmental issues and increased consciousness about what products decrease a consumer’s environmental footprint, the ease of access to a wide variety of these products at GreenCupboards.com has provided a real spur for customer traffic. Plus we try to impart our own witty, receptive and youthful office culture to shoppers to enrich their experience from just another click-and-buy routine to an eco-boosting, memorable interaction.
MO: How important has the process of educating consumers on making more sustainable choices been in growing the company?
Josh: Giving customers the option to research and interact with a particular product enables us to engage in a dialogue with shoppers, explaining why we choose to sell a certain item and providing them with adequate information on a product’s uses, origins, ingredients, warnings, certifications, awards and why it is “green”. We don’t want our shoppers left guessing. We’re here to guide them, so the provision of product information helps GreenCupboards.com establish an informative as well as diverse shopping experience.
MO: You have set your sights on international expansion. How much will you need to pivot your business model in order to reach a greater audience outside of the US?
Josh: Going international is a big step, so we’re in the process of revamping our business model to accommodate a move abroad. One of my primary concerns is maintaining our above-and-beyond customer service in non-English speaking markets. It’s an exciting move, but requires us to look at ourselves from the perspective of customers overseas. Not an easy move but self-critical modifications are nonetheless part of our unfolding.

GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here!

Etailz, a digital marketplace consultant and online retailer that operates sites such as Ecomom, EveryCasa and GreenCupboards, was acquired today by Trans World Entertainment for $75 million in cash and stock, a surprising development for the largely bootstrapped startup.
Etailz was founded by Josh Neblett in 2008 as a 21-year-old senior at Gonzaga University in Spokane. He chose to keep the business there, and it has since grown from just two employees to a sizable digital marketplace, with growing profits and revenues. Over the 12-month period ended September 2016, Etailz posted $116 million in revenue. And from 2013 to 2015, sales grew from $27 million to $93 million.

Operating income also has grown, rising from $800,000 to $3.4 million between 2013 and 2015.
The company made the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest growing companies four years in a row, and also ranked 57th on the GeekWire 200, a list of the top privately-held tech companies in the Pacific Northwest.
Neblett originally planned to become a financial advisor, but decided to take a swing at entrepreneurship during his last year at school. He worked closely with Spokane investor Tom Simpson — who also happened to be Neblett’s entrepreneurship professor at Gonzaga — to get the concept of Etailz off the ground.
“We adhere to a strict bootstrap mentality, are focused on profitability and plan to build the company for the long-term,” Neblett told GeekWire in a 2012 interview. The company raised a small amount of angel investment — about $1.56 million in funding — to fuel the business, but it largely grew through its own profits.
We’ve reached out to the company to get more details, and we’ll update this post as we hear more. A conference call is slated for Tuesday morning.
Etailz CEO Josh Neblett.
Etailz was originally founded as GreenCupboards.com, an eco-friendly product marketplace. It changed its name to Etailz after acquiring Ecomom in 2013, and has expanded to offer five niche retail sites: greencupboards.com, an eco-friendly retailer; ecomom.com, selling family-oriented eco-friendly products; coybeauty.com, a beauty product retailer; everycasa.com, a home product retailer; and vaultelectronics.com, an electronics retailer.

The company also provides consulting and proprietary software for companies in the online marketplace and e-commerce arenas, and is one of the top ten retailers on the Amazon Marketplace.
Trans World Entertainment is a New York-based entertainment conglomerate, which operates CD, DVD, and Blueray retail locations across the U.S. under the For Your Entertainment and Suncoast brands. The company’s stock rose over 8 percent to $3.72 per share in after-hours trading on Monday following the announcement.
According to the release, Trans World paid $36.2 million in cash and issued 5.7 million shares of TWMC stock to Etailz shareholders (valued at $19.6 million based on the closing stock price on October 14). It also assumed liability of Etailz $4.2 million employee retention bonus plan, of which $1.9 million was paid at closing. An earn-out of up to $14.6 million will be payable in 2018 and 2019, provided that Etailz achieves $6 million in operating income in 2017 and $7.5 million in 2018.
Etailz headquarters will remain in Spokane and all of its management team with “digital marketplace expertise” will stay on board, according to the release.
“We look forward to accessing the relationships, operational expertise and infrastructure they have built to help unlock the full potential of Etailz and accelerating our progress towards being the industry leader for digital marketplace sales and expertise,“ Neblett said in the release.
