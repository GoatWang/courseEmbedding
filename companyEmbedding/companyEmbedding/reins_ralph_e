Reins Named Mack Chairman Newcomer - Already President, Ceo - Acquires Titles From Curcio - tribunedigital-mcall






 


 Home→Collections→Mack TrucksReins Named Mack Chairman Newcomer - Already President, Ceo - Acquires Titles From CurcioNovember 04, 1989|by DAN SHOPE, The Morning CallRalph E. Reins has been elected chairman of Mack Trucks Inc., his second promotion since arriving in Allentown less than five months ago.The action took place at a board of directors meeting Wednesday in New York, the company said yesterday.Reins, 49, becomes chairman, president and chief executive officer - having acquired all three titles from John B. Curcio, 56. Reins came to Mack as president and chief operating officer on June 13."The move made sense," said Guru M. Baliga, an industry analyst with McDonald & Co. of Cleveland. "It's good for Mack, but it really doesn't alter its current course."Reins has been impressive. He understands manufacturing. A few years ago, Mack's problems were with manufacturing and its product. Today, the product is there. Now, Mack has to improve its production. Reins is the man to do it."Reins was named chief executive officer on Sept. 13, and became heir- apparent for chairman on Oct. 18, when Curcio submitted his resignation as chairman.The latest announcement came two months after Renault's chief of truck operations, Phillipe Gras, learned that the company expects to lose $50 million in the third quarter and about $88 million for this year.Gras promised to "make heads roll" at Mack, according to a French newspaper. He's upheld that promise.Renault owns about 45 percent of Mack's common stock and has four directors on Mack's 10-member board.Analysts had speculated that a Renault executive would become Mack's new chairman because of Reins' limited time with the truck maker."I don't know what a Renault executive would have brought to the show," said Charles Harris, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. of New York. "When Curcio was kicked upstairs by Renault a couple of months ago, he'd given up 90 percent of his responsibility to Reins anyway. So it made sense to name Reins."Before coming to Mack, the Detroit native was president of ITT Automotive Inc. of Rochester, Mich.Reins began his career in 1963 with General Motors Corp., where he progressed through several management positions.He moved to Rockwell International Corp. in 1972, where he was a senior level engineer and manager in the company's North American and European automotive operations.In 1980, Reins became vice president and general manager of Rockwell's axle division.Two years later, he advanced to president and general manager of Rockwell's on-highway operations, and was named an officer of the parent company and a member of its management committee.Reins joined ITT Corp. in 1985 as president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, one of the world's largest suppliers of components and systems to automotive manufacturers."The problem with Mack has been that there was too much in-breeding," Baliga said. "The company never kept in stride on the manufacturing level. That is no longer the case."

Reins Huddles With Mack Team To Develop A Winning Game Plan - tribunedigital-mcall






 


 Home→Collections→Mack TrucksReins Huddles With Mack Team To Develop A Winning Game PlanOctober 15, 1989|by DAN SHOPE, The Morning CallWhile John B. Curcio once spoke to his troops at Mack Trucks Inc. like a drill sergeant, new president and chief executive officer Ralph E. Reins is now inspiring his Mack team like a college football coach.Curcio lost the hearts and minds of many of his union workers by closing Mack's Allentown assembly plant and attempting to keep the plant in Winnsboro, S.C., as non-union.Now, Reins, fresh out of Detroit, is huddling with employees - including the United Auto Workers - to detail his new game plan.Just two weeks after he replaced Curcio as CEO at Mack on Sept. 13, Reins led "pep rallies" with more than 1,000 employees in the Lehigh Valley to discuss the future of the company and address numerous questions - from AB Volvo's possible acquisition of Mack to its declining market share.When the day-long rallies concluded, Reins returned to the chief executive's office on the sixth floor of Mack's world headquarters in Allentown and discussed the company's future with the local media until about 8 p.m.It had been a long day, but Reins was obviously excited about his plans."The fundamental ($500 million) investments Mack has made in facilities and product development have been correct," said Reins, taking a cue from Bo Schembechler, football coach at his alma mater, Michigan. "The biggest problem yet still lies in terms of building basic execution, implementation and the discipline to take the time to do it right."Whether the change in approach will pull the truckmaker out of its losing streak is still a question mark.Mack is expected to lose close to $90 million this year. But Reins already is inspiring teamwork by ending a four-year feud with the UAW and bringing in a "first team" of executives from Detroit."When you talk to these people, you're going to hear a different attitude," Reins said. "You won't feel some reversion to the old."They're going to have the same damn concern I have about how we can improve listening, looking and facilitating - on the shop floor or in the test center."Two weeks ago, he recruited Don DeFosset, president of off-highway products and driveline division at Rockwell International Corp., and William C. Craig, a vice president of human resources at Volkswagen of America."Don and I go back with each other since 1976, when he was my divisional controller at Rockwell International," Reins said. "At the start, I hand- groomed him . . . When I went to ITT, he and I parted company. I even saw him socially after that since we both lived in Detroit. I need some help from someone I know and trust . . ."Bill Craig is very people-conscious, and truly believes in a participative management style, and the positive impact it can have on productivity and the quality of life on the work floor. In 1978, he was asked to go into employee relations for Volkswagen and quickly won the respect of (UAW International Secretary-Treasurer) Bill Casstevens."With Craig arriving in Allentown, Mack is ready to negotiate a labor agreement in Winnsboro, where the UAW won the right to represent the 635- employee plant in an election in April."I asked Casstevens if we could kick off the negotiations at a time when I will have someone in place, because I couldn't personally afford the time to sit at the table," Reins said. "He has been very accommodating. I think we're truly getting off on the right foot."Moving out of key positions have been Curcio, who remains chairman; former executive vice president of administration Louis J. LaFontaine, and executive vice president of manufacturing John J. Costa.Asked if more top-level changes will follow, Reins smiled and said nothing."A one-man band can make a certain impact, but its going to take a handful - a first team - that's really ready to play together," Reins said. "This thing is going to take a concise, cohesive vision from the top through the bottom, with no breaks in that vision . . . Right now, the team's improved."In reducing Mack's work force by 21 percent to 7,694 workers, Reins also broke a Mack tradition by cutting a high percentage of white-collar employees.Reins cut his payroll by furloughing 1,100 production workers, about 500 salaried employees and about 200 slots that had been filled by subcontractors.That won points with Mack's blue-collar element."People came to me and said, 'We can't afford to lay anybody off,' " Reins said. "I said, 'I'm sorry. There's going to be an equality of sacrifice.'"I have received some very positive comments from that vein. People said 'We were happy to see you carved some cost out of other areas that in the past were fairly sacred.' "Not included in the 21-percent cut are the 550 assembly line workers in Macungie who will be temporarily laid off tomorrow because of a truck cab shortage caused by a strike at Motor Panels Inc. of Norwalk, Ohio.This move hurts Reins - and the company - as much as a football coach who loses half his starting offensive line.1 | 2 |  Next
