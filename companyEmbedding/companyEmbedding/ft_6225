Product Description

			
			PHASE III 6225 8' VHF Antenna 6db Gain Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements. They also feature Shakespeare's unique low-angle radiation that puts your signal where it matters most. All of our extra heavy-duty Phase III radomes are completely foam-filled. This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.Collinear-phased 5/8-wave elementsBuilt for performance and durability, this flagship Phase III antenna won't mind high speeds and high winds. Its great looks will be welcome on your boat, and so will its reliability.FeaturesSilver-plated outer conductor, copper inner conductorStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting anddismounting for stowageSuggested mount: Shakespeare Style 4187-HD Ratchet MountMax. Power Input: 150 wattsSWR: Less than 1.5:1 at 156.8 MHzBandwidth: 3 MHz within 2.0:1 VSWRFrequency: VHF Marine BandDC Gorunding: Yes

Riverfront property in the heart of downtown New Port Richey overlay district with commercial possibilities. Roomy 3BR split plan with 2 1/2 baths and oversize one car garage. Very open floor plan with bowed windows in LR, spacious kitchen with loads of storage space open to family room and a Florida room overlooking private back yard and river. Seawall and floating dock with water & electric (and the pontoon fishing boat is for sale, too!) Patio for alfresco dining. All the festivals and events are near by, as are restaurants, shops, Sims Park with the playground and so much more. New Port Richey is like stepping back in time to small town quaintness. Imagine yourself opening a bed 'n breakfast in this growing area to mention just one of the possibilities in this overlay district.

I did an SWR check and it is performing excellently.  If you don't know how to install an N connector you will have a problem with this.  If not you'll love it.  I like the fact that, in the unlikely event you go under something that is too low and damage this mast you can simply unscrew the lock and remove it.  Than all you have to do is reconnect the N connector at the antenna and screw in the mast lock and you're as good as new.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsShakespeare 6225ByJackon February 19, 2013Verified PurchaseThe Shakespeare 6225 antenna is a beauty, and has all the "right" attributes to transmit and receive better than most, but I have not installed it yet, so the true test is yet to come.  I was very impressed with the stainless fittings, and the strength of the whole system.I just received the LMR 400 cable for it, so installation will begin soon.Read more0Comment|

PHASE III 6225 8' VHF Antenna 6db Gain Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements. They also feature Shakespeare's unique low-angle radiation that puts your signal where it matters most. All of our extra heavy-duty Phase III radomes are completely foam-filled. This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.Collinear-phased 5/8-wave elementsBuilt for performance and durability, this flagship Phase III antenna won't mind high speeds and high winds. Its great looks will be welcome on your boat, and so will its reliability.FeaturesSilver-plated outer conductor, copper inner conductorStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting anddismounting for stowageSuggested mount: Shakespeare Style 4187-HD Ratchet MountMax. Power Input: 150 wattsSWR: Less than 1.5:1 at 156.8 MHzBandwidth: 3 MHz within 2.0:1 VSWRFrequency: VHF Marine BandDC Gorunding: Yes
