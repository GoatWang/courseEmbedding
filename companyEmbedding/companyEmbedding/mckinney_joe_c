NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- New York REIT, Inc. ("NYRT" or the "Company") (NYSE:   NYRT), today announced that Joe C. McKinney has been appointed to the NYRT Board of Directors (the "Board") as a new independent director, effective immediately. Mr. McKinney's appointment follows the retirement of Robert H. Burns from the Board. Mr. Burns has served as an independent director since October 2009 and recently informed the Board of his intention to retire. Mr. Burns, age 87, has confirmed that his retirement did not involve any disagreement with the Company's operations, policies or practices, nor with the Company's management or the Board.


Mr. McKinney has been Vice-Chairman of Broadway National Bank ("Broadway"), a locally owned and operated San Antonio-based bank, since October 2002. He formerly served as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase Bank-San Antonio from November 1987 until his retirement in March 2002. With more than 43 years of experience, Mr. McKinney brings significant executive management, financial services and real estate expertise to the New York REIT Board as the Company focuses on executing its previously announced plan of liquidation.
"We are pleased to welcome Joe to the NYRT Board and are confident that his extensive financial background, executive leadership experience and real estate knowledge will be tremendous assets as we execute the plan of liquidation," said Randolph C. Read, Chairman of the Board of Directors of NYRT. "We look forward to benefiting from his experience, judgement and fresh insights as we work to maximize value for all stockholders."
"I am excited to join the NYRT Board and leverage my prior executive and board experience as we work to execute the Plan of Liquidation as quickly and efficiently as possible," said Mr. McKinney. "New York REIT has an outstanding portfolio of high-quality assets and is in a position of strength as it moves through the liquidation process. I look forward to working closely with the Board and management team to deliver the best possible value to stockholders." 
"On behalf of the Board of Directors and management team, I want to express our sincere thanks to Bob for his many years of dedicated service to NYRT," continued Mr. Read. "We have greatly benefitted from his counsel since our founding in 2009 and wish him the best in his retirement."
"It has been a privilege to serve on the NYRT Board and I am proud of the Company's accomplishments over the past eight years," said Mr. Burns. "With the appointment of a new external advisor and stockholder approval of the plan of liquidation, I believe that now is the time to retire from the Board."
