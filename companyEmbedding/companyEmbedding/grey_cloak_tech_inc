The market for our software is intensely and increasingly competitive and
subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. In addition, many
companies in our target market are offering, or may soon offer, products and
services that may compete with our soon to be released product. Our current
primary competitors generally fall into two categories: large software
companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence products
that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our software and
new and emerging click-fraud analytic software companies, that the company may
or may not know about We expect competition to increase as other established and
emerging companies enter the click-fraud detection analytic software market, as
customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are
introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our
cloud-based software. This is a relatively new and evolving area of software,
and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for this type
of product.

Many of our competitors, particularly large software companies, have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing,
distribution, professional services or other resources and greater name
recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong
relationships with our potential customers and extensive knowledge of the
industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Moreover, many of
these competitors are bundling their click-fraud detection software into larger
software sales, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead
to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products
available for free or a nominal price. We may not be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results
of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these
competitive pressures.

Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of
factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include
ease and speed of product deployment and use, analytical and statistical
capabilities, performance and scalability, the quality and reliability of our
customer service and support, total cost of ownership, return on investment for
the customer. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or
other areas will adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Moreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing
so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our
potential customers. In addition, our prospective indirect sales channel
partners may establish cooperative relationships with our competitors. These
relationships may limit our ability to sell our product through specific
distributors, technology providers, database companies and distribution channels
and allow our competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These
developments could limit our ability to obtain sales from potential customers.
If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors,
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.


Company Description
The Company's business is developing a cloud based software to detect 
advertising fraud on the internet. According to a recent study titled "The Bot
Baseline: Fraud in Digital Advertising", click fraud, and fraudulent "bot" 
traffic will cost the global display advertising industry 6.3 Billion in


 2015.
The study was conducted jointly by the ANA and White Ops in August and September
2014. and a 57 page report was published in December 2014. The study is
considered to be the latest information about fraud in digital advertising. The
ANA recruited 36 member companies to participate. The participants worked with a
wide variety of agency partners, including media agencies, full-service 
agencies, and in-house agencies. The study measured 181 campaigns, 5.5 billion
impressions in 3 million domains over 60 days to determine fraud activity. The
Bot Baseline: Fraud in Digital Advertising 57 page report is public information
and is available and wildly published on the internet.

Topline findings from the study conducted in August and September 2014 include:

. Botnet controllers hijack everyday consumers' identities and home machines to
  conduct ad fraud

. Almost a quarter (23 percent) of video ad impressions were identified as bot
  fraud
  
. Eleven percent of display ad impressions were classified as bot fraud

. Publishers who bought sourced traffic from a third party, as a means to drive
  additional unique visitors to their site, had a bot fraud rate of 52 percent
  on that sourced traffic

. Programmatic display bot traffic averaged 17 percent bot fraud

. Bot fraud for retargeted ads was 19 percent

The study also revealed that bot fraud levels vary across the day with peak
activity occurring when users are sleeping, but their computers are still awake,
between midnight and 7am. Additionally, impressions coming from older browsers
such as IE6 (Internet Explorer 6) and IE7 had fraud levels of 58 and 46 percent,
respectively.

Bot fraud originates from malicious sites with phony ad traffic that passes
through both legitimate and "phantom" elements of the digital advertising
ecosystem.  Fraudsters collect payments from advertisers for non-human
impressions.

About the ANA, (Association of National Advertisers) located in Washington, DC,
provides leadership that advances marketing excellence and shapes the future of
the industry. Founded in 1910, the ANA's membership includes more than 640
companies with 10,000 brands that collectively spend over $250 billion in
marketing and advertising. The ANA also includes the Business Marketing
Association (BMA) and the Brand Activation Association (BAA), which operate as
divisions of the ANA. The ANA advances the interests of marketers and promotes
and protects the well-being of the marketing community. White Ops provides
botnet detection and digital fraud prevention. White Ops would be considered a
competitor of the company.

The Company believes that there is a market for an easy to use fraud protection
and quality of traffic system.

URL Masking - Grey Cloak Tech

URL Masking Home | URL Masking 









URL is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator and is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet. A URL has two main components: Protocol identifier: For the URL http://example.com, the protocol identifier is http . Resource name: For the URL http://example.com, the resource name is example.com.
Domain masking or URL masking is the act of hiding the actual domain name of a website from the URL field of a user’s web browser in favor of another name. There are many ways to do this, including the following:
1- HTML inline frame or frameset so a frame embedded in the main website actually points to some other site.
2- Mod rewrite or aliases to have the web server serve the same page for two different domain names.
3- Virtual hosting whereby the HTTP server uses the (required) host field to serve up several different websites based upon only the host field of the HTTP GET request.
Once the URL is masked it displays the URL mask rather than the original URL/domain name. With masking the domain name it does not affect the content of the actual website, it only covers up the original URL/domain name. Domain masking prevents users from being able to see the actual domain website, and is often a technique used by scammers to increase false ad clicks.

How Does this Impact my Business?
Is my ad budget safe? As a growing epidemic, click fraud is siphoning the ad budgets of large corporations and SMBs alike, without discrimination. Financial services, insurance and e-commerce are a few of the highly impacted verticals. With automated black hat practices such as bot-generated website traffic and fabricated view counts on videos, seemingly any online advertiser’s budget is fair game.
Protection for Digital Marketers
Reputable digital marketing agencies themselves have come under scrutiny in the absence of a system to vet the legitimacy of their practices and authenticate traffic "statistics" - a critical metric in the processes of online ad pricing and decision-making. Credibility breeds confidence. Let us open the doors to new business for you through our B2B certification program.

We are registering a total of 6,600,000 shares of our common stock for sale by
selling shareholders. The company issued 3,300,000 common shares and, 3,300,000
common stock purchase warrants to investors that invested in the Company’s
Regulation D Rule 506(b) Private Placement Memorandum, dated January 15 2015.
The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the 3,300,000 common
shares that are being registered. The company will receive $1,650,000 if all the
3,300,000 warrants are exercised at 0.50 cents per share.


The market for our software is intensely and increasingly competitive and
subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. In addition, many
companies in our target market are offering, or may soon offer, products and
services that may compete with our soon to be released product. Our current
primary competitors generally fall into two categories: large software
companies, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence products
that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our software and
new and emerging click-fraud analytic software companies, that the company may
or may not know about We expect competition to increase as other established and
emerging companies enter the click-fraud detection analytic software market, as
customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are
introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our
cloud-based software. This is a relatively new and evolving area of software,
and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for this type
of product.

Many of our competitors, particularly large software companies, have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing,
distribution, professional services or other resources and greater name
recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong
relationships with our potential customers and extensive knowledge of the
industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Moreover, many of
these competitors are bundling their click-fraud detection software into larger
software sales, often at significant discounts. Increased competition may lead
to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products
available for free or a nominal price. We may not be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results
of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these
competitive pressures.

Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of
factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include
ease and speed of product deployment and use, analytical and statistical
capabilities, performance and scalability, the quality and reliability of our
customer service and support, total cost of ownership, return on investment for
the customer. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or
other areas will adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Moreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing
so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our
potential customers. In addition, our prospective indirect sales channel
partners may establish cooperative relationships with our competitors. These
relationships may limit our ability to sell our product through specific
distributors, technology providers, database companies and distribution channels
and allow our competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These
developments could limit our ability to obtain sales from potential customers.
If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors,
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.


Company Description
The Company's business is developing a cloud based software to detect 
advertising fraud on the internet. According to a recent study titled "The Bot
Baseline: Fraud in Digital Advertising", click fraud, and fraudulent "bot" 
traffic will cost the global display advertising industry 6.3 Billion in


 2015.
The study was conducted jointly by the ANA and White Ops in August and September
2014. and a 57 page report was published in December 2014. The study is
considered to be the latest information about fraud in digital advertising. The
ANA recruited 36 member companies to participate. The participants worked with a
wide variety of agency partners, including media agencies, full-service 
agencies, and in-house agencies. The study measured 181 campaigns, 5.5 billion
impressions in 3 million domains over 60 days to determine fraud activity. The
Bot Baseline: Fraud in Digital Advertising 57 page report is public information
and is available and wildly published on the internet.

Topline findings from the study conducted in August and September 2014 include:

. Botnet controllers hijack everyday consumers' identities and home machines to
  conduct ad fraud

. Almost a quarter (23 percent) of video ad impressions were identified as bot
  fraud
  
. Eleven percent of display ad impressions were classified as bot fraud

. Publishers who bought sourced traffic from a third party, as a means to drive
  additional unique visitors to their site, had a bot fraud rate of 52 percent
  on that sourced traffic

. Programmatic display bot traffic averaged 17 percent bot fraud

. Bot fraud for retargeted ads was 19 percent

The study also revealed that bot fraud levels vary across the day with peak
activity occurring when users are sleeping, but their computers are still awake,
between midnight and 7am. Additionally, impressions coming from older browsers
such as IE6 (Internet Explorer 6) and IE7 had fraud levels of 58 and 46 percent,
respectively.

Bot fraud originates from malicious sites with phony ad traffic that passes
through both legitimate and "phantom" elements of the digital advertising
ecosystem.  Fraudsters collect payments from advertisers for non-human
impressions.

About the ANA, (Association of National Advertisers) located in Washington, DC,
provides leadership that advances marketing excellence and shapes the future of
the industry. Founded in 1910, the ANA's membership includes more than 640
companies with 10,000 brands that collectively spend over $250 billion in
marketing and advertising. The ANA also includes the Business Marketing
Association (BMA) and the Brand Activation Association (BAA), which operate as
divisions of the ANA. The ANA advances the interests of marketers and promotes
and protects the well-being of the marketing community. White Ops provides
botnet detection and digital fraud prevention. White Ops would be considered a
competitor of the company.

The Company believes that there is a market for an easy to use fraud protection
and quality of traffic system.

The event is made possible through the support of returning title sponsor, Vans.Grey Cloak Tech, Inc. (GRCK) announced today that they have been engaged to do a strategic influencer marketing campaign for the Skateboarding Hall of Fame.

"As I approach Vans' 50th anniversary, I am honored to be among this special group of people who support skateboarding around the globe year after year. Vans and I will be bringing some of our golden celebration to the 2016 Skateboarding Hall of Fame Awards for a special evening dedicated to the legends of skateboarding and the future of this incredible sport," says Steve Van Doren, VP of Events and Promotions for Vans.Additional sponsorship opportunities are currently available. Sponsor packages include digital media impressions and news coverage through Grey Cloak's creative influencer marketing and public relations campaign."We're engaging social media influencers to create authentic conversations surrounding the event," says Tina Mulqueen, VP of Marketing for Grey Cloak Tech. "Influencers are hand-selected to ensure their audiences align with the demographic of the skateboarding culture, so that there's inherent social validation inside of these marketing efforts. The result is a sort of social media product placement that is strategically activated by the Hall of Fame event."Grey Cloak anticipates that a combination of these influencer conversations, in addition to strategic media coverage, will garner hundreds of millions of digital media impressions for the Skateboarding Hall of Fame and its sponsors. Grey Cloak's influencer marketing offerings were introduced in January as an effort to provide alternative digital campaigns to fraud-riddled pay-per-click advertising, an issue that the company sought out to resolve last year with their proprietary Fraudlytic technology. Fraudlytic tracks and eliminates hundreds of permutations of digital advertising fraud. The Interactive Advertising Bureau projects a combination of malicious digital advertising practices will cost advertisers $8.2 billion annually.For more information or to learn about Skateboarding Hall of Fame sponsorship opportunities, contact Tina Mulqueen.About Grey Cloak TechGrey Cloak Tech is the premier provider of software solutions that identify, track and eliminate digital advertising fraud.

Fraudlytic™
Grey Shield’s robust platform remains unsurpassed in PPC protection. Our comprehensive program uses the most trusted methodologies including behavior-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning and memory dump analysis. Managed by internet experts in electronic fraud intelligence, Grey Cloak’s algorithms continuously respond to advancing fraud techniques. The Grey Shield product is the online advertisers’ choice when it comes to safeguarding pay per click spend.
Impression Fraud: Click fraud is ever evolving via manipulations of impressions. Grey Shield applies state-of-the-art, ever evolving detection programming to swiftly analyze and prohibit:

Masked URLs
Cookie Hijacking
Device Hijacking
IP Spoofing
Domain ID Theft
Ad Stacking

Doorway Site Detection: Search engine “doorways” are artificial web pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge by cloaking their actual URLs. Grey Shield’s landing page auditor penetrates false doorways and permanently bars them from your potential customers.
Self Programmable SAAS solution: Reduce IT costs with Grey Shield’s easy-to-set-up campaigns that provide detailed reports based on users behavior or on the campaign level. It will tell you which marketing campaigns are effective and which are fraudulent so they can get a predictable ROI. You can either block the bad traffic so it never reaches your website or you can see it in the reporting and make your marketing decisions on future campaigns, phones, tablets, and laptops.
Grey Shield’s Arsenal of Algorithms Include:

Digital Fingerprinting
Advanced Geo Detection services
Pattern Recognition
Bot & Virus Infection Detection
Proxy Network IP Surveillance
Domain Masking Detection

Graceful Interface: Grey Cloak’s API integrates seamlessly into your analytics programs, Programmatic or RTB Networks, and Google, Yahoo, and AOL.
TrueClick Compliance

This product includes all of same features of the basic TrueClick package with the addition of a selective online marketing feature especially useful for regulated industries that need to stay in state or federal compliance. By adjusting links and images to correspond to the viewer demographics of your digital campaigns, such as the variations in state interest rates that insurance providers and banking institutions face, your ads remain in compliance with governing statutes.
An ad campaign appearing in the wrong state advertising the wrong interest rate, even by as small of a fluctuation of .25%, can cost the advertiser thousands and thousands of dollars per ad…plus, any fees or fines incurred for non-compliance!


Geo Location Feature: Your ads run specific to the location of the device. For example, as a traveler changes states, his device will adjust your ad accordingly where he might see a different ad or be redirected to another website.
Non-approved States: Screen out non-approved states from specific ad campaigns from showing in states that are not approved for that product.
Target marketing: This functionality also allows you to geographically target your ad compaigns. You can determine a geographical radius corresponding to a store location or desirable zip code market.
TrueClick Compliance X-Platform

By adding cross platform functionality to our TrueClick Compliance package, advertisers can control what viewers see—no matter what device they are using. Your ads run identically on Windows and Macintosh operating systems, as well as on popular digital devices such as smartphones and Surface Pros.

What to Expect
With Grey Cloak Tech as your partner, you can expect to benefit from industry leading technology, a top tier client services team, and an increased bottom line. It’s truly that simple.

Defusing the Digital Advertising Ticking Time Bomb: Fraud


Says Mathew Ingram in his recent Fortune article, "Half of all online ads are never seen by a human being, huge amounts of traffic and clicks come from bot networks, and fraud is rampant." This is what you can do to protect yourself.

“This is the biggest advertising story of the decade, and it’s being buried", says Ad Contrarian Bob Hoffman.In December 2014, a problem that advertising insiders kept close to their vests was thrust into the public domain after the ANA conducted the first large-scale study on digital advertising fraud – an offense that they determined would cost unsuspecting advertisers a projected 6.2 billion dollars this year.In the aftermath of the study findings, a few things happened: savvy tech entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to raise capital for an apparent gap in the industry, and fraudsters have gotten smarter.Says Mathew Ingram in his recent Fortune article, "Half of all online ads are never seen by a human being, huge amounts of traffic and clicks come from bot networks, and fraud is rampant."And Sam Scott lists the three main allegations in his recent Moz article:Half or more of the paid online display advertisements that ad networks, media buyers, and ad agencies have knowingly been selling to clients over the years have never appeared in front of live human beings.Agencies have been receiving kickbacks and indirect payments from ad networks under the guise of “volume discounts” for serving as the middlemen between the networks and the clients who were knowingly sold the fraudulent ad impressions.Ad networks knowingly sell bot traffic to publishers and publishers knowingly buy the bot traffic because the resulting ad impressions earn both of them money--at the expense of the clients who are paying for the impressions.Defusing the Ticking Time BombOne digital advertising fraud detection company, Grey Cloak Tech, invested over 2 and a half years – including documentation of thousands of marketing campaigns – to overcome the multi-billion-dollar problem. Now in business, they noticed a curious trend in their fraud detection analyses:"On first analysis, virtually all of our clients show varying degrees of bot fraud – depending on the industry and their traffic sources, the fraudulent traffic is between 30-100%. But sometimes something peculiar happens – the same metrics show a dramatic and unprecedented decline in fraud rates. What's happening is that our clients are passing our data along to their agencies, some of which then look for ways to bypass the system,"says Joshua Silver, VP of Sales and Marketing of Grey Cloak.Outsourcing Ad FraudAccording to Silver, one tactic offenders pursue is to hire real people, often in other countries for very little money, to click on campaigns:"It's a sort of fraud outsourcing. When real people click on ads, it's harder for software programs to detect because it follows a trajectory of authentic human behavior, but it's still damaging because these people have no intention of purchasing the advertised products."Silver, who has been in the digital advertising space for several years, drew from his history in the space to create a software that stays ahead of this evolving click fraud."Fortunately, having roots in digital advertising gave me insight on this problem. I know what traffic companies do when they're being watched, and we built our system to evolve as fraudsters evolve."Not only does the subscription-based service engage an advanced set of metrics to measure subtle indicators of more than 100 permutations of digital advertising fraud, but the company also employs a team to analyze the data and look for troubling nuances, and they update their database regularly to stay ahead of the curve.Unlike Google filters and other no-cost analytics software, Grey Cloak's technology is laser focused on removing fraudulent activity from campaigns, an important distinction when considering the high percentage of fraudulent traffic that appears across virtually all types of campaigns.Silver notes: "Because fraud is evolving so rapidly, and perpetrators are engaging both real people and technology to beat software, there was a need to create a sophisticated fraud detection technology on behalf of our customers to give our clients back control of their marketing campaigns."Coming to Your Mobile Phone: More Ad FraudWhat's worse, the problem of digital ad fraud continues to evolve. According to Robert Hof in his recent Forbes article:Now, the fraudsters have started moving to mobile phones. Using a technique that one ad fraud detection company calls mobile device hijacking, the scammers use mobile apps such as games that run as many as 20 ads a minute, then simulate random clicks. Forensiq, a New York firm that provides ad fraud detection and prevention, today is releasing one of the first studies to look at the relatively new technique.Already, the company says, more than 12 million devices have been infected-about 1% of devices Forensiq observed in the U.S. and 2% to 3% in Europe andAsia. Forensiq figures that the hijacking affects some 13% of all in-app advertising impressions.The cost to advertisers is adding up quickly, Forensiq founder and CEO David Sendroff said in an interview. He projects that in-app ad fraud, which the company estimated at $857 million last year, will pass $1 billion worldwide this year.Ad Fraud Is Complicated Even Further with Programmatic Media BuyingAnd if that weren't enough to give you pause before your next digital advertising campaign, consider that in their first ever published estimates, eMarketer disclosed that US programmatic ad spend topped $10 billion in 2014 and is projected to double to more than $20 billion by 2016. This represents 63% of total digital display advertising. Lauren Fisher, analyst for eMarketer says, “2014 has proven a pivotal year, and with the majority of infrastructure now laid and testing well in progress, we’ll see programmatic ad spending explode from 2015 into 2016.” With this kind of dominance, there’s little question that programmatic advertising is here to stay (see related article, "Problematic Programmatic Media Buying").Bottom Line: Find A Partner to Protect Yourself Against Digital Ad FraudUnless you are looking to dig deep into this problem yourself, the best course of action is to find a partner who can protect you from digital ad fraud. Look to companies like Grey Cloak Tech, to ensure you aren't losing your advertising budget to digital ad fraud.
