Investors give Caspian Capital hearty welcome

The spinoff of credit hedge fund manager Caspian Capital LP from parent Mariner Investment Group LLC is getting an enthusiastic thumbs-up from institutional investors and consultants.The 15-member Caspian Capital team set up shop in New York last week, bringing with them the $2.6 billion they managed in two hedge funds and five separate accounts while at Mariner Investment Group, which is headquartered in Harrison, N.Y.Caspian has formally separated from Mariner and will register as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission later in the first quarter, according to sources close to both firms who asked not to be identified.

The move will reduce Mariner's total assets under management by 22% to about $9 billion. Mariner will retain a minority equity stake in Caspian; the remainder will be owned by Caspian employees.The Caspian team is led by the firm's principals and co-portfolio managers Mark Weissman, who founded Caspian in 1997, and Adam Cohen and David Coleto.The firm's flagship event-driven debt hedge fund approach focuses on distressed and stressed securities, capital structure arbitrage and value short strategies. Its first fund, Caspian Capital Partners LP, was launched March 1, 1997, and experienced one down year (2008) since inception. Annualized performance through Oct. 31 was 11.6%.The CCP fund has been closed to new investors since 2008 and has a largely high-net-worth investor base.The firm's $1.2 billion Caspian Select Credit International LP was launched in 2007. It uses a similar, but more liquid, strategy than CCP and has had similar returns. Between 60% and 70% of CSCI's investor base is institutional. The investor breakdown in Caspian's five separately managed hedge fund accounts, totaling $700 million, could not be learned.Consultants said clients invested in Caspian's funds will not redeem their investments because of the impending spinoff and, in fact, consultants are recommending Caspian for credit investments to other clients.



New mandate
Even before fully gaining independence, Caspian Capital already has attracted a substantial new mandate from the $43.2 billion 
Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System, Harrisburg, which committed $200 million in December to Caspian Select Credit International LP.The retirement system's investment staff and trustees made the decision to invest with full knowledge of the company's executives' plans to leave Mariner, according to documents on the retirement system's website.Aksia LLC, the system's specialist hedge fund consultant, supported the internal staff recommendation to invest in the Caspian fund based on due diligence of the strategy and operations, according to online documents.Aksia's memo to system trustees said Caspian will continue to use Mariner's fund administration, legal and compliance support, technology, human resources and marketing support services.“Caspian has a strong management team and operational platform with the support of Mariner. Caspian also has a strong risk management culture, where preservation of capital is paramount, and they use no net leverage to generate their returns,” wrote James H. Grossman Jr., the system's managing director of external public markets, risk and compliance, in the Nov. 19 internal memo to trustees.“We anticipate that CSCI will generate low to mid-double-digit returns with single-digit volatility,” the memo said.“Caspian's independence is a positive move,” Patrick Adelsbach, a partner and head of event-driven and credit hedge fund manager research at New York-based Aksia, said in an interview.The investment staff and trustees of the $10 billion 
Ohio School Employees Retirement System, Columbus, also were comfortable enough with the spinoff plan to set up Caspian as an independent hedge fund manager to invest an additional $10 million in its CSCI fund in December, said Timothy Barbour, OSERS spokesman. The Ohio pension fund initially invested $29 million in CSCI last May.“Caspian has kept us well informed throughout the process of becoming an independent company. Our investment staff view this (move) as a good thing,” Mr. Barbour said.Executives at Caspian and Mariner are not commenting.Peter J. O'Rourke, Mariner's general counsel, and Richard Holahan, Caspian Capital's general counsel, both declined to comment.However, sources close to Caspian Capital said the move has been in the works for some time, predating the October announcement that ORIX USA Corp. will acquire a majority stake in Mariner's parent company MIG Holdings LLC. Neither the size of the ORIX stake nor the deal price was disclosed. ORIX USA is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based ORIX Corp.Principals pushed
The ORIX deal likely pushed Caspian's principals to make the move at the beginning of this year, said an investment consultant who requested anonymity.“Adam (Cohen) has been intent on getting his own firm for a while now. He's kind of the wunderkind at Caspian,” the consultant said. “I think he wanted to get off the Mariner investment platform before the ORIX deal is finalized,” the consultant added.Mr. Cohen joined Mr. Weissman at Caspian in 2001 after managing distressed debt on Goldman Sachs & Co.'s proprietary trading desk. Mr. Weissman also was a proprietary trader at Bear Stearns & Co. and other investment banks before founding Caspian. Mr. Coleto came to Caspian in 2005 from Goldman Sachs.Sources with knowledge of the terms of the Caspian spinoff who asked not to be identified, said Mariner Investment Group is retaining a 15% minority equity stake.“Mariner had to hold onto at least some of the economics from Caspian. ORIX wasn't going to buy Mariner and not retain some of the income coming from Caspian's hedge funds, which represent a significant chunk of Mariner's assets,” the investment consultant.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Company Description


Caspian Capital seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation, on a favorable risk-adjusted basis, by applying a flexible and opportunistic approach to investing which involves evaluating the current attractiveness of various asset classes including bank loans, bonds, equities, speculative investments and cash equivalents. The firm may trade and make investments in public and private debt and equity securities. They have no fixed limitations or diversification requirements as to specific asset classes in which they invest. Caspian Capital invests in a variety of securities but has historically focused on three trading strategies: (1) stressed/distressed corporate situations, (2) capital structure arbitrage and (3) value shorting. They may engage in other strategies where they believe the risk/reward parameters may be favorable for their clients. In addition, the diversification of the various strategies they employ varies depending on market conditions and opportunities.Caspian’s investment approach is based on fundamental analysis, with valuation work and models focusing on, among other things, going concern and asset liquidation scenarios. The firm opportunistically buys stressed/distressed positions of companies they believe have quality assets, high market share, strong free cash flow and/or a near-term catalyst. Caspian continually looks for relative pricing and valuation anomalies which drives their capital structure arbitrage opportunities. They also seek to establish short positions in companies whose business models expose them to significant cyclicality or potential negative events with asymmetric risk/reward.Caspian Capital's client accounts have the ability to invest in all securities in the capital structure of a company. The firm has significant expertise in corporate credit and they may invest (long and short) in credit instruments such as (1) first and second lien bank loans and (2) senior secured, junior secured, senior unsecured, junior unsecured, mezzanine and subordinated corporate bonds. In addition, they expect to have exposure to common and preferred equities, options, warrants, swaps (including credit default swaps), other derivatives and/or convertible bonds.

School Employees Retirement System of Ohio


                                                                                     •  Columbus, OH                                                                            

                                        The Mission of SERS is to provide our members, retirees, and beneficiaries with pension benefit programs and services that are soundly financed, prudently administered, and delivered with understanding and responsiveness.

Vision

Where We Will Go - SERS understands the need to change based on our current environment and mission.  Our values will help guide us as we explore the development of a sustainable pension and health care model, the creation of a "change-ready" culture, and the development of new strategic partnerships over the next five years.

SERS will explore the costs and benefits of new types of pension and health care funding structures and investment models, eligibility and service delivery models to ensure the most efficient and effective uses of our members’ resources. SERS will review pension and health care plan design, eligibility and reduction factors in light of current and future environmental factors.
 
In weighing the alternatives, SERS will keep in mind the overriding goals to:

    Maintain a sound level of funding.
    Provide access to health care for eligible SERS retirees and their dependents.

SERS is committed to an organizational culture in which both Board and staff support success in meeting the challenges of our environment.  This change-ready culture will require:

    Understanding the emerging needs of members and retirees, and how our partners can help us meet those needs.
    Highly skilled and empowered Board and staff members who clearly understand their roles and responsibilities, and are provided with the training, tools, and organizational support to enable success.
    Performance measures that hold vendors as well as SERS accountable for individual and team performance in achieving SERS’ goals.
    Collaboration and partnership within and across departments and partner organizations, focused on achieving the mission and goals of SERS.
    Continual process improvement and innovation to reduce costs and improve service levels.

SERS believes that the key to achieving our mission will be through strategic partnerships with those organizations and individuals who have an impact on our members’ well-being and financial security. This new model of communication and collaboration will allow us to identify, and deliver solutions for, the issues of greatest impact to our members and retirees.
 
SERS will explore new ways to communicate with our strategic partners:

    Multiple service channels for our members: (face-to-face, electronic, web, multi-lingual, etc.).
    Increased communications through employers, as well as directly to members and retirees.
    Lobbying and public education to minimize the potential for detrimental legislation.
    Education and communication to all partners, to provide:
        Realistic expectations of benefits
        Clear understanding of the value of the employers' investment
        Tools to assist our members in effective retirement planning and preparation

Our Values

Who We Are - We believe these deeply ingrained principles guide all of our actions and enable SERS to fulfill its mission: 

    Member and Retiree Focus
    We focus on the needs of our members and retirees by “serving the people who serve our schools.”
    Integrity
    We believe in the highest professional standards and ethical conduct and the accountability needed to succeed and achieve our goals.  We uphold ethical and professional conduct by word and example.
    Open Communication
    We practice respectful, direct, and proactive communication.
    Continuous Innovation
    We celebrate success and strive for quality, and continually seek better ways to fulfill our mission to our members and retirees. We value individual and organizational courage, and a willingness to change.
    Teamwork
    We are committed to achieving our mission in a manner that encourages participation and values each person’s contributions.

Strategic Plan

Creating a secure retirement requires a partnership among members, employers, and public retirement systems, each with important responsibilities. 

The SERS Leadership team defined the responsibilities for each partnerfor four critical elements of retirement security, and created a Retirement Security Compact. This Compact described each partners’ responsibilities and provided a framework that the Leadership team used in developing strategic priorities and tactics.

Elements of a secure retirement include:

    A  well thought-out plan for retirement
    Sufficient financial resources
    Good health
    Life resources

In light of the Retirement Security Compact, the Leadership team identified 5 strategic priorities:

    Develop Long-Term Plan for Pension Security
    Develop Long-Term Plan for Healthcare Security
    Ensure Effective Board and Staff Collaboration
    Communicate Effectively with Stakeholders
    Ensure Appropriate Resource Structure (human, financial, infrastructure)
