                China Recycling Energy Corp. manufactures energy saving ballasts and related equipment. Its operations are carried out through the following recovery systems: Blast Furnace Top Gas Recovery Turbine Unit, Cement Low Temp Heat Power Generation, Waste Gas Power Generation, Combined Cycle Power Plant, and Biomass Waste Power Generation. The TRT utilizes high pressured gas emitted from the steel blast furnace and converts the pressured energy into mechanical energy to drive the turbine units and generate electricity. The CHPG collects and utilizes medium to low temperature wasted steam and gas emitted from production process of the cement rotary kilns to generate electricity. The WGPG utilizes flammable waste gas emitted from coal mining, petroleum exploitation, and refinery processing as a fuel source to generate electricity. The CCPP generates electricity by burning previously released gas generated during the iron making process of blast furnaces. The BWPG utilizes high pressured gas emitted from the furnace that burns biomass waste such as wood, straw, rice straw, rice husk, and biogases, and then converts energy into mechanical energy to drive the turbines and generate electricity. The company was founded by Guo Hua Ku in May 2004 and is headquartered in Xi'an, China.

					Full Description



China Recycling Energy Corporation, incorporated on October 6, 2001, is engaged in the recycling energy business, providing energy savings and recycling products and services. The Company develops waste energy recycling projects for industrial applications in China. The Company offers waste energy recycling systems to companies for use in iron and steel, nonferrous metal, cement, coal and petrochemical plants. The Company's waste pressure-to-energy solution consists of the blast furnace top gas recovery turbine unit (TRT), a system that utilizes high pressure gas emitted from the blast furnace top to drive turbine units and generate electricity. Its waste heat-to-energy solution consists of heat power generation projects for applications in cement, steel, coking coal and nonferrous metal industries, which collect the residual heat from various manufacturing processes, such as the entrance and exit ends of the cement rotary kilns, to generate electricity. The Company's waste gas-to-energy solution consists of the waste gas power generation system (WGPG) and the combined cycle power plant (the CCPP).The Company's projects capture industrial waste energy to produce electricity. The Company designs, finances, constructs, operates and eventually transfers waste energy recycling projects to meet the energy saving and recovery needs of its customers. Its waste energy recycling projects use the pressure, heat or gas, which is generated as a byproduct of a range of industrial processes to create electricity. The Company conducts its business through its subsidiary, Sifang Holdings Co., Ltd. (Sifang Holdings), its subsidiaries, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Huahong) and Shanghai TCH Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai TCH), Shanghai TCH's subsidiaries, Xi'an TCH Energy Technology Company, Ltd. (Xi'an TCH), Xi'an TCH's subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd. (Erdos TCH) and Xi'an TCH's subsidiary Xi'an Zhonghong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Zhonghong). Zhonghong is engaged in providing energy saving solutions and services, including constructing, selling and leasing energy saving systems and equipment to customers.Waste Pressure to Energy SystemsTRT is a power generating system utilizing the exhaust pressure and heat from industrial processes in the iron, steel, petrochemical, chemical and non-ferrous metals industries, often from blast furnace gases in the metal production industries. In a TRT system, the blast furnace gas produced during the smelting process is directed through the system to decrease its pressure and temperature. The released pressure and heat is then utilized to drive the turbine unit to generate electricity, which is then transmitted back to the producer.Waste Heat to Energy SystemsThe waste heat to energy systems utilize waste heat generated in industrial production to generate electricity. The waste heat is trapped to heat a boiler to create steam and power a steam turbine. The Company's waste heat to energy systems use waste heat from cement production and from metal production. It has over two cement low temperature heat power generation systems. These projects use approximately 35% of the waste heat generated by the cement kiln and generate over 50% of the electricity needed to operate the cement plant.Waste Gas to Energy SystemsThe Company's WGPG uses the flammable waste gases emitted from industrial production processes, such as blast furnace gas, coke furnace gas, and oil gas, to power gas-fired generators to create energy. A CCPP system employs a power generating cycle to utilize the waste gas and generates electricity by burning the flammable waste gas in a gas-fired generator (WGPG). It also uses the waste heat from burning the gas to make steam to generate additional electricity through a steam generator (CCPP).The Company competes with Hangzhou Steam Turbine & Power Group, China National Material Group, Sinoma Development Co., Ltd., China Senyuan Electronic Co., Ltd., Dalian East New Energy Development Co. Ltd., Top Resource Conservation Engineering Co., Ltd., Nanjing Kaisheng Kaineng Environmental Energy, Nanjing Kaisheng Cement Technology and Engineering Co., Ltd., Jiangxi Sifang Energy Co., Ltd., Beijing Century Benefits Co., Ltd., Beijing Shineng Zhongjin Energy Technology Co., Ltd., Kunming Sunwise Co., Ltd. and China Everbright International Ltd.
