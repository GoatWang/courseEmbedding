By Cliff Kuang1 minute ReadTom Metcalfe’s coffer maker isn’t going to make anyone’s morning routine quicker–that’s not the point. Instead, he sought to make the process a ritual, with the result being a Platonically perfect cup of coffee. The device is disarmingly simple: Two burners inside a lacquered box and three glass beakers. But the process is a bit more complex than your normal drip: First, you roast the beans yourself, for 7-9 minutes; then, you grind them, and finally they steep for four minutes. Not a quick pick me up–rather, a stubbornly slow one. The design details are spot on—witness the clever ribs in the roasting beaker, around minute 1:30 of the video below, which turn the coffee beans over. (If the beaker was smooth, the beans wouldn’t be heated evenly.) advertisementIt sounds like a stretch, but the idea of creating long-lived, statement products has profound implications. As Metcalfe says, “To achieve genuine sustainability, products must not be temporary or transient.” You might call that philosophy long-cycling–and designers are increasingly signing up for it, in an age where making new stuff rather than holding on to what we already have inevitably churns up more carbon. The MacArthur-fellow and inventor Saul Griffiths, for example, makes the intriguing point that buying a Rolex might be an environmental move. If you make a product that lasts ten times longer, that’s the same as cutting its carbon footprint by a factor of ten:Here’s a couple more nice images of the coffee maker: Do you guys have any examples of design that can last a lifetime?  [Via Gizmodo and Yanko] advertisementRelated: Starbucks Instant Coffee: Our Be-All, End-All Taste TestRelated: Taste Test: Is Illy’s Canned Coffee Premium Enough? advertisementRelated StoriesProductMeet The Designer Who Still Leads The Bernie Sanders ResistanceProductA Rare Look At One Of MoMA’s First Design ShowsCitiesMeet The NYC Renter Who Built A Business Exposing Bad LandlordsadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasThis Map Shows Where People’s “Civic Space” Is Most ThreatenedIdeasWhy IBM Pays Its Employees To Take Time Off To Tackle The World’s ProblemsIdeasThis Database Tells You Which Bad Chemicals Are Hiding In Your Tap WaterEntertainmentEntertainmentThis Chrome Extension Makes Every Trump Tweet a Little More HonestEntertainment“Sex And The City” Star Mario Cantone Graciously Volunteered To Be SNL’s Anthony ScaramucciEntertainmentInside The Dumbest First Amendment Battle Of 2017Co.DesignSpacesDonald Trump’s Drawing Is Even Worse Than You ThinkSpacesThis Skatepark Is A Sculpture You Can RideCitiesThis Crowdsourced Project Is Mapping Mysterious Photos Of Lost New YorkFast CompanyIdeasThis Map Shows Where People’s “Civic Space” Is Most ThreatenedTechnologyThis Denim Company Thinks Blue Jeans Can Go Green And Still Be AffordableTechnologyTo Find A Cure For Blindness, These Scientists Are Mimicking Fish Eyes

Over the past six months, Studio resident Tom Metcalfe has been developing his understanding of composite materials from an art and design perspective, through a micro-residency supported by the Bristol-based National Composites Centre. In a Lunchtime Talk, he presented the various iterations of a composites-based hourglass vase and explained the process. Here are five key points I took away:
- Broadly speaking, composite materials are made of two or more different materials, to make them more robust. An early example is mud and straw to make bricks, plywood is a common composite material, and a more complex example would be carbon fibre. These materials are used in all manner of industries - to make lightweight but strong aeronautical or maritime vehicles, in the production of Kevlar vests, to develop safe sporting equipment such as skis and skates, and to generate energy amongst many other applications. 
- In being selected for the micro-residency, Tom was granted access to the manufacturing plant that typically has exclusive use by skilled professionals, due to the complex processes required. Tom was keen to explore the craftsmanship that goes into that process and find ways to make composites more accessible to artists and designers. Currently, materials are often expensive, difficult to mass-produce and recycle, and the use of the 'making' spaces filled with necessary machinery implicate health and safety issues. Tom hoped to test these barriers to determine an entry-level to composite craft. 
- Tom created his vases in an approach he likened to traditional tailoring. His first successful lay-up involved coating an existing vase with release film, wrapping it in glass cloth with a multi-directional stretch as opposed to the one-directional stretch of carbon fibre, using a spray mount to set and impregnating with resin. Once dried, Tom had achieved a hardy and interesting half vase shell with a texture on the outside and a smooth and glossy resin-soaked underside. 
- In the next iteration of the vase, to achieve the neat wrapping of the material, Tom will have to introduce robotic intervention to map and cut a petal shape that will adjoin when sculpted to the shape of the vase. 
- A useful method for predicting the use of composites is to compare to properties in the natural world, such as skin. If you can understand the way skin stretches across the contours of the body and its malleability, you come some way to understanding the benefit of composites and their unique features.
