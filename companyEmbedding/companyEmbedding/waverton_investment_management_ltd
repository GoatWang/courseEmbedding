Waverton - Our History

< Back to About Us

Our History
Our history and culture are based on the original values laid down by the Hambro Family: namely providing the highest levels of investment management and service to our clients. Ever since our inception, we have sought to maintain these values and have grown organically, attracting some of the most experienced investment managers in the industry to join us.
Waverton Investment Management was originally founded as J O Hambro Investment Management (JOHIM) in 1986 by Richard Hambro. For the first fourteen years the company was owned by the Hambro Family and senior management. In 2001, JOHIM was acquired by the Credit Suisse Group, although it remained an independently managed entity. In 2013, Credit Suisse agreed to sell JOHIM to Bermuda National Limited, since re-named Somers Limited, and to the existing management team, thus re-establishing our credentials as an independent owner-managed investment management house. Our original investment philosophy and focus on individual client service remain unchanged and Directors  and employees of the firm have an equity stake in the business, thus aligning ourselves with the interests of our clients.
It was agreed by the Board, following the acquisition from Credit Suisse, that we would change our name from JOHIM to Waverton Investment Management in recognition of the new structure of the firm. Waverton was already the name used for the majority of our existing funds as well as being the name of the Hambro Family home in Gloucestershire, built originally by Jocelyn Hambro. Waverton therefore preserves our link to our founding principles embraced by the Hambro Family, but at the same time acknowledges the independent ownership of the firm going forward.
Our business remains as always: the discretionary management of investment portfolios for private individuals, charities and institutions to the highest levels of performance and personal service.

Background Information:


Waverton Investment Management Ltd. »
Waverton is an active manager that follows a flexible, pragmatic approach, being open to new themes and ideas, instead of being beholden to a particular philosophy.The firm invests in equities and fixed-income on a global basis.  Company visits are an essential part of the investment process and fund managers visit North America, Continental Europe and Asia several times a year.The stock selection committee meets weekly to monitor and review investment ideas and make portfolio changes. An asset allocation meeting also meets monthly to review macroeconomic, political and other global trends that may affect any decision making process over and above stock selection.Waverton aims to achieve capital growth and dividend income. Research is provided by external institutions. The investment process is bottom-up, and the key indicators monitored include: management that is rewarded for the good performance of the company; market leadership; operation in an industry that has significant barriers to entry; and large market potential. Investment decisions are taken by the individual fund managers, who specialize geographically.The firm tailors each investment portfolio to the client's financial needs and believes that the way to achieve superior returns over the long-term is not to be constrained by excessive benchmarking or overly rigid asset allocation parameters. The investment team is driven by individual stock ideas, but the firm is not afraid to make significant judgment calls about asset classes. They believe that qualitative evaluation of a company's prospects is more important than 'number crunching' and that preserving this emphasis on quality protects clients' assets in difficult times.
