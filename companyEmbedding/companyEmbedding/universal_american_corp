TAMPA, Fla., April 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE:    WCG) ("WellCare") announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Universal American Corp. (NYSE:    UAM) ("Universal American") following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. With approximately 119,000 Medicare Advantage (MA) members in Texas, New York and Maine, Universal American is now a wholly owned subsidiary of WellCare.








"We are very pleased to complete our acquisition of Universal American," said Ken Burdick, WellCare's CEO. "This transaction strengthens our business by increasing our Medicare Advantage membership by a third, deepening our presence in two key markets—Texas and New York—and diversifying our business portfolio. Importantly, we look forward to leveraging Universal American's core competency in physician engagement to strengthen and grow our value-based provider relationships."
"We also welcome Universal American employees, members, agents, and providers to WellCare," continued Burdick. "WellCare and Universal American have a shared commitment to serving Medicare beneficiaries, and we look forward to working together to ensure a smooth transition."
Burdick added, "As part of the transaction, Richard Barasch, Universal American's chairman and CEO, will be leaving the company. Under his leadership, Universal American built a strong business and talented team committed to delivering quality care and service. I thank him for his leadership and support throughout the transaction."
The transaction is expected to be $0.60 to $0.70 accretive in the first year following the close and an incremental $0.10 accretive in the second year following the close, excluding one-time transaction-related expenses of approximately $30 million and integration costs of approximately $25 million to $30 million, to WellCare's adjusted earnings per diluted share. WellCare continues to expect annual synergies of approximately $25 million to $30 million by 2019. The company will provide more details regarding the transaction on its first quarter 2017 earnings conference call that is scheduled for May 3, 2017.
Under the terms of the agreement, Universal American stockholders received $10.00 in cash for each share of Universal American common stock they held at closing. Consistent with WellCare's announcement on November 17, 2016, the total transaction value is approximately $800 million, including the assumption of debt and the make-whole premium payable on conversion of Universal American's convertible debt. WellCare funded the transaction with unrestricted cash available from both entities.
Universal American has approximately 69,000 Medicare Advantage (MA) members in a 4.5-Star plan in Houston-Beaumont, Texas and more than 20,000 MA members in a 4.0-Star plan in the Northeast, primarily in New York, as of March 31, 2017. In addition, Universal American partners with Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) in 10 states, five of which are WellCare Medicare Advantage markets.
BofA Merrill Lynch served as financial advisor to WellCare. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Bass, Berry & Sims PLC served as legal advisers to WellCare. MTS Health Partners, LP served as financial advisor to Universal American. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP served as legal advisor to Universal American.
Leadership Update
Under WellCare, Erin Page, president, Medicare, will continue to have responsibility for the Universal American Medicare Advantage business in Texas, New York and Maine as well as the ACO business in Texas. Additionally, she will now have responsibility for WellCare's Medicare Advantage business in Texas and Louisiana. In this role, she will oversee strategy, regulatory compliance, network management, sales and marketing, medical management, and administration for these businesses. Page will report to Michael Polen, executive vice president of WellCare's Medicare business. Page was the president of Universal American's Medicare business for 4 years. She joined Universal American in 2001 and held roles with increasing responsibility.
Jeff Spight will continue to lead the Management Services Organization/Accountable Care Organization (MSO/ACO) business, which operates as Collaborative Health Systems. As president, MSO/ACO, Spight will report to Polen. In this role, Spight will set strategy, drive implementation and create market opportunities to grow value-based provider relationships for WellCare. Spight joined Universal American in 2013.
"Erin and Jeff are seasoned Medicare leaders who we expect will significantly contribute to our growth and quality goals," said Polen. "I look forward to working with them to leverage the best from both organizations for the benefit of our members and provider partners." 
About WellCare Health Plans, Inc.
Headquartered in Tampa, Fla., WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYSE:    WCG) focuses exclusively on providing government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. The company served approximately 4.0 million members nationwide as of January 1, 2017. For more information about WellCare, please visit the company's website at www.wellcare.com.
Basis of Presentation
In addition to results determined under GAAP, WellCare provides certain non-GAAP financial measurements that management believes are useful in assessing the company's performance. Adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude the effect of certain expenses related to previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs ("investigation costs") and amortization expense associated with acquisitions ("acquisition-related amortization expenses"). Management believes these items are not indicative of long-term business operations performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company is not able to project at the time of this release the amount of future investigation costs or acquisition-related amortization expenses and, therefore, cannot reconcile projected adjusted earnings per diluted share to projected GAAP earnings per diluted share. 
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statement
This news release contains "forward-looking" statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or that include words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. For example, statements regarding the company's financial outlook, and the financial impact of the acquisition contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause WellCare's actual future results to differ materially from those projected or contemplated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, WellCare's progress on top priorities such as integrating care management, advocating for our members, building advanced relationships with providers and government partners, ensuring a competitive cost position, and delivering prudent, profitable growth, WellCare's ability to effectively estimate and manage growth, WellCare's ability to effectively execute and integrate acquisitions, potential reductions in Medicaid and Medicare revenue, WellCare's ability to estimate and manage medical benefits expense effectively, including through its vendors, its ability to negotiate actuarially sound rates, especially in new programs with limited experience, the appropriation and payment by state governments of Medicaid premiums receivable, the outcome of any protests and litigation related to Medicaid awards, the approval of Medicaid contracts by CMS, any changes to the programs or contracts, WellCare's ability to address operational challenges related to new business, and WellCare's ability to meet the requirements of readiness reviews. Given the risks and uncertainties inherent in forward-looking statements, any of WellCare's forward-looking statements could be incorrect and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these and other important risks and uncertainties can be found in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), included under the captions "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other filings by WellCare with the SEC, which contain discussions of WellCare's business and the various factors that may affect it. Subsequent events and developments may cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from WellCare's forward-looking statements. WellCare's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which the statements are made. WellCare undertakes no duty, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events, developments or otherwise.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
