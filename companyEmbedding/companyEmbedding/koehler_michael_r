Kohler Faucets, Sinks, Toilets, and Tubs
Welcome to Kohler, the industry king in faucets, toilets, sinks, for bathroom and kitchens. As one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of bathroom and kitchen fixtures, Kohler has made a name for itself as an elite brand. When you think about it, we ask a lot from our plumbing fixtures. They not only need to look good, but also function—and function perfectly for years. Kohler can live up to, and exceed the lofty expectations we set for the faucets and fixtures in our homes. Kohler manufactures complete lines of kitchen and bathroom plumbing fixtures. Here at FaucetDirect.com, we specialize in providing a streamlined Internet shopping experience for thousands of Kohler faucets and fixtures. The Kohler motto is before they make a faucet beautiful, they make it tough. All Kohler faucets come with lifetime warranty against leaks and drips, and a one-year warranty on parts. The durability of every faucet keeps them working perfectly for decades. Kohler has been manufacturing faucets since the 1870s and is a huge innovator in plumbing technology. Kohler faucets do more than ever before—they’re versatile, easy to use, and amazingly efficient Kohler kitchen and bathroom faucets offer the industry’s most innovative designs and features. The engineers constantly redefine traditional styles, as well innovate new products. As one of the largest manufacturers of faucets, fixtures and accompanying accessories, they know a thing or two about what their customers like. The Kohler Karbon series is a revolutionary design introducing the ultimate in articulating faucets. This highly adjustable faucet is an innovator in modern style and function. Each of the Kohler collections are available in a large selection of finishes, with a variety of metals, and flat colors. Kohler’s kitchen faucet valves are made from durable and long-lasting solid brass and zinc die-cast metal. All fixtures are available in a variety of finishes such as brushed nickel, stainless steel, and polished chrome.There are tons of options for new Kohler products. We suggest finding a style and collection name that fits your style, then a finish to match. Once you find a collection its easy to match an entire collection of faucets, towel bars, soap dishes, etc. A brushed nickel finishes gives a more modern appeal while, brass the more classical. Find a theme that fits your home, it's a great way to enhance the look and feel of your interior design. Kohler faucets, fixtures, and accessories are a great way to reach that goal.

Kohler Faucets, Sinks, Toilets, and Tubs
Welcome to Kohler, the industry king in faucets, toilets, sinks, for bathroom and kitchens. As one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of bathroom and kitchen fixtures, Kohler has made a name for itself as an elite brand. When you think about it, we ask a lot from our plumbing fixtures. They not only need to look good, but also function—and function perfectly for years. Kohler can live up to, and exceed the lofty expectations we set for the faucets and fixtures in our homes. Kohler manufactures complete lines of kitchen and bathroom plumbing fixtures. Here at FaucetDirect.com, we specialize in providing a streamlined Internet shopping experience for thousands of Kohler faucets and fixtures. The Kohler motto is before they make a faucet beautiful, they make it tough. All Kohler faucets come with lifetime warranty against leaks and drips, and a one-year warranty on parts. The durability of every faucet keeps them working perfectly for decades. Kohler has been manufacturing faucets since the 1870s and is a huge innovator in plumbing technology. Kohler faucets do more than ever before—they’re versatile, easy to use, and amazingly efficient Kohler kitchen and bathroom faucets offer the industry’s most innovative designs and features. The engineers constantly redefine traditional styles, as well innovate new products. As one of the largest manufacturers of faucets, fixtures and accompanying accessories, they know a thing or two about what their customers like. The Kohler Karbon series is a revolutionary design introducing the ultimate in articulating faucets. This highly adjustable faucet is an innovator in modern style and function. Each of the Kohler collections are available in a large selection of finishes, with a variety of metals, and flat colors. Kohler’s kitchen faucet valves are made from durable and long-lasting solid brass and zinc die-cast metal. All fixtures are available in a variety of finishes such as brushed nickel, stainless steel, and polished chrome.There are tons of options for new Kohler products. We suggest finding a style and collection name that fits your style, then a finish to match. Once you find a collection its easy to match an entire collection of faucets, towel bars, soap dishes, etc. A brushed nickel finishes gives a more modern appeal while, brass the more classical.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Build.com has received 4.1 out of 5 stars based on 38 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
