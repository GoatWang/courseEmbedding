Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. BAN2401 is an antibody that binds to amyloid, which could reduce its presence in the brain and potentially slow the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.
















BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2)

Lupus


This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.
















BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2)

Lupus


This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

BAN2401 (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. BAN2401 is an antibody that binds to amyloid, which could reduce its presence in the brain and potentially slow the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.
















BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2)

Lupus


This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]
Acquisition history[edit]
The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.

This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB092

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)


Licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects adults. This devastating disease typically advances quickly and affects movement, speech, vision and cognitive function. Currently, there are no effective therapies for PSP.
How this therapy could help:
In PSP, deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form within neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells. BIIB092 is an antibody targeting tau which may reduce the spreading of the abnormal form of this molecule from one nerve cell to the next, potentially slowing the progression of the disease.
















BIIB093 (glibencamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibencamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibencamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB067 (IONIS-SOD-1Rx)

SOD-1-Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)


Developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.
ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons provide the ability to move, speak, swallow, and breathe. As the disease progresses, ALS patients gradually lose these abilities.
How this therapy could help: 
In a rare form of ALS, a mutated protein called superoxide dismutase (SOD1) has been associated with the degeneration of motor neurons.  SOD1-ALS is the second most common form of inherited or familial ALS, accounting for up to 20 percent of familial ALS and 2 percent of all ALS cases. 
BIIB067 (IONIS-SOD-1Rx) is thought to reduce the production of SOD1 protein and is being evaluated to see if it can potentially slow the fatal progression of SOD1-ALS.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.
















BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2)

Lupus


This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

Aducanumab (Aβ mAb)

Alzheimer’s disease


Developed in collaboration with Neurimmune.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in  the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

E2609 (BACE1 inhibitor)

Alzheimer's disease


Developed in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. E2609 is a small-molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, a protein that cleaves enzyme 1 (BACE1). By inhibiting BACE1, E2609 blocks amyloid production, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.

How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functionality decline of Alzheimer’s disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. BAN2401 is an antibody that binds to amyloid, which could reduce its presence in the brain and potentially slow the progress of the disease.

BG00011 (STX-100)

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)


Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease in which lung tissue becomes thickened and stiff due to scarring. The formation of scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the disease progresses, it becomes harder for the lungs to work properly and the body cannot get the oxygen it needs. This debilitating disease is almost always fatal.
How this therapy could help:
The TGF-beta brain cell pathway is involved in several fibrotic diseases. The BG00011 (STX-100) antibody may selectively block the TGF-beta pathway, and may slow the development of fibrosis in IPF patients.
















BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2)

Lupus


This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
BDCA2 is a protein present in specific cells within the immune system. An antibody against BDCA2 can potentially interrupt production of interferons, inflammatory molecules that are increased in patients with lupus and contribute to disease activity. 
















BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor)

Trigeminal neuralgia (TGN)


Acquired in acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals
Trigeminal neuralgia is an extremely painful condition usually involving one side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain which frequently occurs spontaneously but is also commonly evoked by trivial stimuli including washing, shaving, smoking, talking and/or brushing the teeth (trigger factors). The pain follows one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve, which provides nerve sensation from the mouth, face and the front of the scalp. The intensity of the pain and its unpredictability results in profound effects on the quality of life of patients.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB074 (Nav1.7 inhibitor) is a novel state dependent small molecule sodium channel blocker that preferentially inhibits the Nav 1.7 ion channel, a therapeutic target implicated by genetics in human pain conditions. BIIB074 is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav channels in a novel manner, and has the potential to provide a new and effective option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.
















BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV)

Stroke


It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. The target indication for BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) is large hemispheric infarction (LHI), a severe form of ischemic stroke where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to a disproportionately large share of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
How this therapy could help:
In pre-clinical studies, BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV) has been shown to block SUR1-TRPM4 channels that mediate stroke related brain swelling. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated the potential of BIIB093 to reduce brain swelling, disability and the risk of death in patients with LHI.
















Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L)

Lupus


Developed in collaboration with UCB, Inc.
This chronic inflammatory disease occurs when the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in skin, joints, kidneys, the brain and other organs. It is a difficult disease to diagnose because it resembles several other conditions.
How this therapy could help:
CD40L is a protein in B and T cells, which helps regulate the immune system. Dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) is an antibody that blocks CD40L, potentially lessening disease activity in lupus patients.
















Natalizumab (α4-integrin inhibitor)

Acute ischemic stroke



Currently approved as TYSABRI® for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease. Please visit TYSABRI.com for prescribing and safety information.
It is estimated that nearly two million people in the United States and the European Union will have a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and serious long-term disability. There is a substantial unmet medical need for new therapies that can improve outcomes in acute stroke. 
How this therapy could help:
Natalizumab is thought to reduce the inflammatory cells in the brain by blocking the lymphocytic infiltration, known to occur in the brain following stroke, which may reduce the extent of injury.
















Opicinumab (anti-LINGO)

Multiple sclerosis (MS)


This disease causes the body’s immune system to attack myelin, a protective sheath covering nerve fibers. Damage to myelin “short circuits” communication between the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body, severely impairing such neurological functions as mobility, vision and thinking. Over time, the nerves themselves can become damaged permanently.
How this therapy could help:
LINGO-1 is a CNS specific-protein that is involved in the development of myelin. In patients with MS, LINGO-1 may inhibit myelin growth when it binds with its receptor. Data suggest that the antibody anti-LINGO-1 could block this process, potentially allowing for the re-myelination and restoration of nerve communication in MS patients.
















XLRS Gene Therapy

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS)


Developed in collaboration with AGTC
XLRS is a disease that affects young males beginning in their teenage years. It can lead to loss of vision and serious complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment during adulthood.
How this therapy could help:
The XLRS gene therapy is a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) delivering a transgene (RS1) that expresses retinoschisin protein. Normal expression of retinoschisin could potentially improve long-term retinal function and preserve structural integrity.
















BIIB054 (anti-α-synuclein)

Parkinson's disease


Acquired from Neurimmune.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system. People who have this disease experience tremors, slow movement, muscle stiffness, and impaired balance.  As these symptoms become progressively worse, patients have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
How this therapy could help:
BIIB054 targets abnormal alpha-synuclein protein that is associated with the destruction of nerve cells. This progressive degeneration is the cause of Parkinson's disease.
















BIIB076

Alzheimer's disease


Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that damages healthy cells in the brain causing cognitive impairment and functional disability. It is estimated that more than 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide1.
Today we understand that AD is a continuum with a long silent phase that begins years before symptoms appear. As AD progresses, symptoms like memory loss, personality and behavioral changes commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.
How this therapy could help:
The memory loss and functional decline of AD have been linked to abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Among those proteins are amyloid and tau. Deposits of abnormal tau, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, form in the neurons and are linked to increasing impairment and loss of brain cells associated both with AD and with other neurodegenerative diseases, known as tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. BIIB076 is an antibody targeting tau, the protein that forms the deposits, or tangles, in the brain.

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

History[edit]
Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva[2] by several prominent biologists, including Kenneth Murray of the University of Edinburgh, Phillip Allen Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Walter Gilbert of Harvard (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), Heinz Schaller, University of Heidelberg and Charles Weissmann, University of Zurich (who contributed the first product interferon alpha). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with Nobel Prizes: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in understanding DNA sequencing, while Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for his discovery of split genes.
In 2003, Biogen merged with San Diego, California-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1986 by biotech pioneers Ivor Royston and Howard Birndorf) and adopted the name Biogen Idec. After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.[3] Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.[4] Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the S&P 100, S&P 500, S&P 1500, and NASDAQ-100 and the company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.[5]
In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.[6] Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of Fumaderm and BG-12, an oral fumarate, which is being studied for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.[7]
In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.[8][9]
In February 2013, Bloomberg broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay Elan $3.25 billion for the full rights to Tysabri, used to treat multiple sclerosis.[10]
In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular CNV1014802 – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.[11] In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.[12]
Bioverativ[edit]
In May 2016 the company announced that it will spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a public company.[13] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ, in order to show heritage with Biogen.[14] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[15][16] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[17]

The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):

Pipeline[edit]
Biogen has focused its R&D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.
Investigational MS medicines:

Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.[37]
Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) (Opicinumab): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.[38]

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule (Opicinumab) in acute optic neuritis
Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013
Phase 3:[39] BIIB037 (Aducanumab), Biogen’s first clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease
Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1Rx) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.[40]
In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with Samsung, creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen’s expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.[41]
In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer’s disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.[42]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
