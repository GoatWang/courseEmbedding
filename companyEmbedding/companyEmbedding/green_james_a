Home > HardiePlank > Is HardiePlank® siding a “green” building product?Is HardiePlank® siding a “green” building product?
10/01/2013 by Jenica Lee in HardiePlankWith so many homeowners and builders looking for ways to be more friendly to the environment these days, many folks come to us at Southwest Exteriors wanting to know if our siding, HardiePlank, would be considered a “green” building project. Absolutely! Eco-friendly contractors love this product!  James Hardie Corporation, the manufacturer of HardiePlank® siding, is doing their part to make a positive impact on the environment.  Due to the material composition, manufacturing process, durability, and the regional plant locations, James Hardie building products are a winner for both builders and consumers.
 
Material Composition 
 
HardiePlank® siding is made from natural and sustainable raw materials: cement, sand, wood fiber, and water.  It has no asbestos, glass fibers, or formaldehyde, which makes it a safe building product as well.  The materials are low in toxicity; therefore, it does not harm the environment.  Additionally, it requires far less lumber than wood siding, which ultimately preserves our precious forests.
 
Manufacturing Process
 
James Hardie Corporation continually tests new waste minimization and solid waste recycle technologies to reduce the amount of material that is discarded due to error.  They are developing technologies that will enable them to recycle 100% of their process water used in manufacturing.  By currently recycling water up to four times during the manufacturing process, they help save our slowly depleting natural resource—water.
 
Durability
 
HardiePlank® siding is resistant to damage from flame spread and does not burn like wood siding or melt like vinyl siding.  Additionally, it will not rot, crack, or split, and it is also resistant to moisture and pest damage.  Because of these durable qualities, it doesn’t require frequent replacement, thus taking up far less space in landfills than other siding alternatives that may damage easily or deteriorate in a short time.  Because HardiePlank® siding is a low maintenance and long lasting quality product, the resources required to maintain and repair it are few.
 
Regional Manufacturing Plants
 
James Hardie Corp has eight plants located in the United States, two of which are in Texas, that manufacture their products.  This allows the facilities to minimize their impact on the environment by reducing fossil fuel related transportation costs required to bring raw materials to the plant and to transport the finished products to the retailers. Facilities also help to support their local economies by drawing from raw material suppliers close to each plant.  This helps distribute the material consumption evenly throughout all regions of the country as well as reduce transportation costs, which ultimately benefit the consumer.
 
Green building contractors know that the rewards for using HardiePlank® siding far outweigh the cost, therefore making it their number one choice.  They know that homeowners are always looking for the best products for their home as well as being conscientious about their environment. James Hardie siding products are definitely designed to be safe, durable, and to make the wisest use of all resources.
 
If you have any further questions about HardiePlank siding, feel free to contact us directly.

Green, James -- 8'3 6wt Fiberglass Fly Rod





Sold Out


$295.00 US






           For sale here is a rod made by Jim Clarkson of Raptor Rodworks in Chico California. It's made from a James Green blank. 8'3" for a 6wt line. Made in a four-piece configuration. The rod is in near mint condition. The only sign of use is light soiling on the grip. The rod features orange un-sanded glass with darker burnt orange wraps. Black tipping at the signature wrap, ferrules, and tip-top. Black witness marks for easy alignment. Shallow full wells grip as compared to a more "curvy" style of full wells. Down-locking reel seat with a beautiful burl wood spacer. Spigot ferrules for a more efficient transfer of energy. Rod weight 3 1/2 oz. The rod has a full-flexing action more on the medium side of medium fast. The four-piece design makes this rod highly packable for hikes to high mountain lakes. Comes with original bag and black aluminum tube.

Green Builder® Media Honors James Hardie for Most Sustainable Siding Products
Survey shows James Hardie still the leading green choice for exterior cladding.



    CHICAGO, Ill. April 28, 2015 — James Hardie, the leader in fiber cement siding, has once again been recognized by Green Builder® for having the most sustainable siding products. Green Builder® Media conducted its annual 2015 Readers’ Choice survey, which highlights leading green brands that have garnered the loyalty of building professionals.

The survey polls readers in the residential construction market to get insights into their sustainable product preferences and brand perceptions. Which green products are most familiar? Which brands do they trust and specify most often?

James Hardie was selected as offering the greenest products in the siding category, with the most respondents recommending the company’s sustainable exterior options over other siding manufacturers.

“A primary factor to James Hardie’s sustainability is its durability,” said John Dybsky, senior marketing manager at James Hardie. “Our products handle high heat, UV radiation and moisture exceptionally well, which significantly reduces the need for replacement over time.”

James Hardie siding is composed of natural and sustainable raw materials such as cement, sand, cellulose fiber and water. While green practices can sometimes limit design options, the company has a range of textures and colors that can satisfy several design variations.

“Looking over this year’s survey results, it’s clear that building professionals think that green products are better and more available than ever before.” said Green Builder editor in chief Matt Power. “About 75 percent of respondents indicated that they believe that green products are higher quality from brands that they know and trust. Familiar brands are at the top of most categories, implying that many customers are still going with the tried-and-true.”

Additional insights from the survey include:

Respondents said that they’d like to continue seeing more innovation and experimentation from manufacturers.
When asked to rank in order the most significant factors that influence brand loyalty, performance (81.1 percent) and quality (80.1 percent) far outweighed price (53 percent).
Nine of 10 respondents agreed that the quality
