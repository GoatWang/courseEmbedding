In his not-for-profit affiliations, Mr. Zannino serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of Pace University.

Published on 2010-01-18. Author :

NEW YORK -- The Board of Directors of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE: EL) has expanded the Board to 14 members and elected Richard F. Zannino as a Director effective January 14, 2010. He will also serve as an additional member of the Audit Committee. 
Mr. Zannino, 51, is a Managing Director at the private equity firm CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, a position he has held since July 2009. He is on the firm's investment committee and co-heads the consumer, retail and media practices. Prior to joining CCMP Capital, he was Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Dow Jones & Company from February 2006 until his resignation in January 2008, shortly after its acquisition by News Corp. Mr. Zannino joined Dow Jones as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in February 2001 and was promoted to Chief Operating Officer in July 2002. From 1998 to 2001, he was Executive Vice President of Liz Claibornewhere he oversaw the finance, administration, retail fragrance and licensing divisions. From 1993 to 1998, Mr. Zannino was with Saks Fifth Avenue, serving as Vice President and Treasurer, Senior Vice President, Finance and Merchandise Planning and then Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He earned his B.S. in finance and economics from Bentley College and an M.B.A. in finance from Pace University. 
"We are very pleased that Rich Zannino is joining our Board of Directors," said William P. Lauder, Executive Chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. "Rich's broad-based experience at various retailing and media companies and his financial expertise will be an asset to our Company and its stockholders." 
Mr. Zannino also serves as a Director of IAC/InterActive Corp. and a Trustee of Pace University. 
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The Company's products are sold in over 140 countries and territories under the following brand names: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, Tommy Hilfiger, Kiton, La Mer, Donna Karan, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin,Michael Kors, American Beauty, Flirt!, Good Skin(TM), Grassroots Research Labs, Sean John, Missoni, Daisy Fuentes, Tom Ford, Coach and Ojon. 
The forward-looking statements in Mr. Lauder's remarks above involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements include current economic and other conditions in the global marketplace, shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products the Company sells, competition, the Company's ability to successfully implement its long-term strategic plan and those described in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.

Richard F. Zannino, 37
Saks Fifth Avenue, Chief financial officer

Where is Richard F.  now?
						Managing director, New York, CCMP Capital
						Updated October 12, 2012
					

By Ylonda Gault
When Richard Zannino's employer shuttered its East Coast operations, Saks Fifth Avenue seemed the least likely of suitors. Mr. Zannino had spent the previous decade navigating financial transactions in the packaging, mining and telecommunications industries as a merger and acquisition specialist with Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. in Norwalk, Conn. The seeming incongruity of the two companies made the tony retailer all the more intriguing to Mr. Zannino, who is known for driving himself hard.Once he met with Saks' core managers, he was sold. "I was completely blown away by the energy of the team here," says Mr. Zannino. "I wanted in."In 1993, he joined the company as vice president and treasurer. He soon fell into the round-the-clock rigors of retailing, a routine made more grueling because Saks' premier status was being threatened by its heavy debt load and tired image.But Mr. Zannino was undaunted, and in a matter of months, he moved from his treasurer post to senior vice president. He has since helped lead Saks through more than $3 billion in capital markets transactions. Last year, after the chain completed one of the hottest initial public offerings of the year, he was named chief financial officer."I've learned that retail is detail," he says. "Get the most return for the least risk."
