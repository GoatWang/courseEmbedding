                        Every Monday, Novus digs into the public holdings of a prominent hedge fund manager. This week, we take a look at Marble Arch Investments.                    





Marble Arch is a prime example of the wildly successful lineage of Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management. Its founder, Scott McLellan, worked at Hound Partners, whose founder, Jonathan Auerbach, worked at Tiger. This “family tree” of hedge funds has produced prolific and successful long/short equity managers, and Marble Arch Investments is no exception. What is particularly interesting to study is the “family resemblance” in investment style and underlying holdings for these managers.
About our Data
Everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data, including the manager’s profile, simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary. The data used here omits the short side, non-equity securities, many non-US securities and all non-public information such as actual fund performance.
Marble Arch Investments and Hound Partners
While we’ve talked extensively about the similarity in portfolio structure between Tiger lineage managers, many have noted the tremendous overlap between Hound and its sibling, Marble Arch. As of the most recent 13-F filings, 60% of Marble Arch’s portfolio is owned by Hound. While that sounds a lot, prior quarters have been nearly 70%!

Both managers take meaty positions in names such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Fleetcor Technologies, and Spirit Aerosystems. These are, of course, Tiger lineage favorites as most of these names hold in excess of 10 participants through our capture of all Tiger “family members.” Before you prematurely conclude that overlap is a bad thing, our data shows that Tiger Cub consensus names greatly outperform and the same can’t be said about all unique stocks. Most of these are world class managers and the securities they invest in have compounded at exceptional rates, so perhaps they are on to something.
Recent Marble Arch Outperformance
Marble Arch’s simulated long portfolio performance has been outpacing the S&P 500 by about 450bps per year, since our first public data capture in Jan 2008. A large amount of the portfolio’s outperformance began after the US debt ceiling crisis in the 3rd quarter of 2011:

Structural Changes
If we look at their portfolio since then, a few things become apparent in terms of structural changes:

The portfolio has reduced the number of long positions from a peak of 26 (07/31/13) to 15 as of the most recent filing
As a corollary, portfolio concentration has risen dramatically, constituting a 50% relative increase in terms of top 5 / top 10 position concentration


This has led to a greater allocation of larger positions in the portfolio, as positions greater than 10% of reported assets have gone from non-existent to nearly 50% of the book. In the last 30 months, that largest position size bucket has annualized at an astounding 40.5%, which shows why the move to a more concentrated portfolio explains the widening outperformance:


We can truly isolate position sizing value add by comparing an equal weighted portfolio to their actual return profile. This allows us to measure how additive the escalation in concentration has been for Marble Arch’s portfolio. We estimate, it has added nearly 3000 bps of outperformance since September 2011:

Finally, if we simply sort the names with the highest average weighting during this period, we can see a strong relationship between sizing and outsized return on invested capital. In fact, there has only been one notable miss (Applied Materials) amongst overweight positions.

This phenomenon is punctuated by the firm’s positioning in Valeant, which has been a huge driver of outperformance, delivering over 4000bps of simulated contribution:

With these trends, we can see the manager engaging in a higher octane investment style, with a clear escalation in the median P/E of the portfolio, as well as a widening negative beta to value:


Conclusion
Marble Arch’s reported long positions have had an extended period of outperformance, beginning in late 2011. This has coincided with a strong move towards increased concentration and is dominated by a growth-factor tilt. The manager continues to outperform the market, and has demonstrated adaptability in the past. The question is whether or not this trend of amplified concentration and growth bias will persist if the market begins to change in tenor.


Three Managers. Three Styles.
An analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha.

What makes a successful hedge fund manager? We believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question. By looking at thousands of active manager portfolios, we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance. These patterns can be viewed as investment skill, or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods.
In this article we use public ownership data and the Novus Alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers. The three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success: investment skill.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
