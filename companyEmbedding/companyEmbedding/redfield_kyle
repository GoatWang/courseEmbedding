KonaRed Corporation is a multifaceted health and wellness
company focused on bringing the benefits of the Hawaiian Coffeeberry® to
the world.Our Hawaiian CoffeeBerry® is the fruit of the commonly known coffee
plant, Coffea
Arabica.
KonaRed is uniquely sourced from Hawaii Coffee, where it has grown for over 175
years.Our project is focused on raising money and awareness of the health benefits of the Coffee Fruit.  Our efforts benefit not only us, but the coffee farmers in poor communities that we produce a new revenue stream for.
Kickstarter will give us the opportunity to showcase our
products in non-traditional packages, and allow us to offer some more of our
lifestyle products like hats, shirts, Hyrdo Flask®, etc.



Risks and challenges
When it comes to fulfillment and logistics issues, we are well positioned.  We have our own fulfilment warehouse in San Clemente, CA and will support this program by shipping direct.  We also have ample product on hand to support all of the rewards we are promoting.

KOLOA, Hawaii, Aug. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — KonaRed Corporation (OTCQB: KRED), a food and beverage company based on the exclusive and highly functional Hawaiian CoffeeBerry® coffee fruit from Kona, Hawaii, announced today that it has hired Kyle Redfield as President and Chief Operating Officer.  Mr. Redfield brings an impeccable industry reputation and extensive experience in growing revenue and profitability across the food, beverage, healthy snacks and dietary supplement industry.
For the past four years Mr. Redfield was General Manager of POM Wonderful, LLC, a beverage and fruit extracts company. At POM Wonderful he started the industrial division and grew the Company’s revenue significantly within 2 years’ time, and the division continues to grow today. The Wonderful Company, parent company to POM Wonderful, generated $3.5 billion in sales as of October 2014. Redfield managed a global sales team, designed and implemented all sales support materials, approved marketing trade expenditures and was the lead negotiator on multiple contracts with co-manufacturers. While expanding global sales reach including opening up the EU and Asia regions, he created multiple processes for customer service, shipping, technical and regulatory compliance, finance and production and was responsible for full management of profit & loss, overhead, travel & entertainment and budgeting.

Mr. Redfield will oversee KonaRed’s global sales efforts, new product development, staff management, forecasting, production, distribution and day-to-day operations. His focus will be on expanding the sales and marketing strategy to increase revenue and profitability.
KonaRed CEO Shaun Roberts stated, “Kyle is a true professional, and we are honored that he has chosen to join our organization.  Given his extensive industry specific knowledge, experience and results-oriented approach at POM Wonderful, Kyle will be instrumental in implementing key strategic objectives to ensure KonaRed achieves its goals now and into the future.”
“I am thrilled at the opportunity of joining KonaRed as President and COO. The Coffee Fruit category is rapidly gaining momentum and this is the perfect time to join KonaRed, the leader in this growing space.  KonaRed is a young company with a quality, US-based supply source from Hawaii, highly sought after products and a great company culture.  It’s the perfect mix for success.  Shaun Roberts has done an excellent job building the foundation of the business and I’m excited to join him in making this a world class organization,” said Kyle Redfield.
