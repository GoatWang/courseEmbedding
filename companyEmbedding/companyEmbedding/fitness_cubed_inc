WORKDAY EXERCISE
THE FIRST SMART UNDER-DESK ELLIPTICAL



FOR EVERY FITNESS LEVEL
WORK + OUT





EVERY STEP MATTERS
When it comes to leading a healthier lifestyle, the more active you can be, the better. Cubii helps keep you moving throughout the day, letting you work out whenever and wherever - even on a conference call.
FOR THE BUSY PROFESSIONAL
You get up. You go to work. And you sit. Until it's time to go home. Sure, you know the importance of exercise, but maybe you can't find the time. Or you're exhausted after a stress-filled day. There is a solution.






 
TRACK WITH 
          THE MOBILE APP 
Finding the motivation to work out can be easier when your progress is monitored.

 
SHARE YOUR
          PROGRESS
 Keep your loved ones up to date with your goals and achievements.

 
COMPETE 
          WITH FRIENDS
 Add in some more competitive spirit and see how you stack up against friends.






THE ONLY DIGITALLY CONNECTED DESK ELLIPTICAL

Finding the motivation to work out can be easier when your progress is monitored. Cubii makes sure you're never alone on your fitness journey by keeping you connected to the digital space around you.




 TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS WITH THE MOBILE APP
Set goals for yourself and measure how far you've traveled, how many calories you've burned, and your daily, weekly, monthly progress. Have the app nudge you after some time of inactivity!

COMPETE WITH
                YOUR FRIENDS
 Create groups have some fun with competitions, and track how you stack up against your friends!



SHARE YOUR PROGRESS WITH LOVED ONES
Share all your small and big wins with your loved ones on social media.

CONNECT WITH FITBIT
Get credit for your Cubii workout. Sync the data to your Fitbit fitness tracker and give a boost to your steps.













NON-ERGONOMIC, LESS COMFORTABLE
A higher range of motion is not optimal for use under a desk - needing application of continued force to keep going and causing knees to hit the desk.
QUIET, NON-INSTRUSIVE DESIGN
Cubii is designed with the optimal angles that allow your legs to move smoothly and comfortably – giving you a unconscious under-the-desk workout with no bumped knees.




COMPARE TO OTHER OFFICE FITNESS SOLUTIONS




A WORKOUT FOR THE DIGITAL AGE





Cubii is a new way to work out. It's a sleek, elliptical trainer that fits neatly under your desk. With it, you can discreetly exercise right in your office. Multi-tasking just got a whole lot healthier.



 QUIET, NON-INTRUSIVE DESIGN
Smooth, quiet range of motion won't distract you and co-workers from the task at hand.



 VERSATILE AND ADJUSTABLE
Choose from 8 levels of resistance and switch between different levels of intensity during the day.



 BURN WHILE YOU EARN
You can burn approximately 150 calories per hour.

Our Story
A LITTLE EXERCISE CAN DO A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD
Cubii was invented by three University of Chicago graduates in their early 20s. Reading the plethora of studies showing the necessity of moderate amounts of exercise all day to help reduce risk for heart disease, diabetes, even certain kinds of cancer, they decided to get more active in their workday. Constrained with limited desk exercise solutions in their own workplace, they decided to leave their jobs and create their own office wellness product. Thus, Cubii was born.

The Inspiration




16 lbs
On average, people gain 16 lbs in just 8 months after starting a desk-bound job.





86%
About 86 percent of Americans sit all day at work - 70 percent don't like it.





21/24
The typical American is sedentary 21 out of 24 hours in the average workday.





1/Min
As soon as you sit, calorie burning drops to one calorie per minute.





20%
Lack of physical activity is the reason for 20% of the deaths of people 35 years or older.





111.4
Every hour of sitting causes your body to gain back 111.4 calories






Behind The Scenes
The journey from ideation to bringing Cubii to life was a challenging, yet exhilarating one. Every decision was guided by user-centric design, making the Cubii look beautiful, and a pleasure to use. And this is just the beginning. The vision is to continue developing new innovations that seamlessly integrate exercise into your life, so you can spend time on what truly matters.

Don't just take our word for it
I push myself hard during exercise, try to eat right and keep my weight down. I sit at a desk for numerous hours each weekday and there is growing empirical evidence about the harmful effects of desk-sitting for long periods of time. I think Cubii is a great solution and is another tool to keep me in a great state of fitness and fight the good fight against Father Time.

Learn More About Cubii






"Sitting down - and the sedentary lifestyle it encourages - is killing you, slowly but surely. The problem is, standing desks aren't for everyone."



This next story might just change the world. It's a new way for people with desk jobs to burn calories while at work.
The overweight problem in the U.S. is at crisis levels, no doubt exacerbated by poor diets, but a contributing factor is the rather sedentary nature of knowledge-based work. It's no surprise, then, that innovation is coming to the workplace to address this perpetual problem.
Time is always short, so why not combine working out with work. Looks like they are taking multitasking to the next level.

Testimonials










"I have been surprised by both the physical and mental benefits of using the Cubii. The biggest surprise I’ve had is that I’ve had to crank down the resistance because it really can be a workout.  I have 2 Cubiis - at home I have the resistance up a lot higher so that it is more of a workout, and I actually find myself reaching a higher heart rate. I have also noticed several changes in my body. I am not trying to lose weight, but I like that feeling of feeling firmer, tighter, and healthier. In the past months, I’ve lost 6 pounds, which I hadn’t even intended to do."
Michelle Langley Laubach, Arlington, Virginia







"I sit at my desk and write posts all day for my job. My fingers get a lot of exercise, but not the rest of me. I don’t even have to get off my ass to fulfill this New Year’s resolution with Cubii. So I’m in. In fact, I’m using it as I write this. It’s simple and easy enough for me to do as part of a daily routine. Underneath my desk, I can’t escape it. And it can keep me honest. It comes with an app that sends you notifications in case you aren’t keeping up. That’s the kind of motivation I could use to stick to my resolutions."

Dean Takahashi, San Francisco, California







"While it took me a few minutes to get down the pedaling rhythm, I found using the Cubii to be an enjoyable experience. It's not a very strenuous workout (which is the point; it's why the Cubii is meant for the office and not for the gym). During my first 30 minute workout I burned 94.7 calories, made 2,569 strides, and went 1 mile. Not bad for a quick half-hour workout after lunch. And I had noticeably more energy afterwards, which definitely came in handy during that mid to late afternoon lull after lunch."

"There are three of us in my immediate family and all of us could benefit from Cubii. The two adults could have some easily accessible exercise even while at our offices; the teen could also benefit because while he has a lot of exercise and activity in his life, he also needs to be in constant motion and fidgeting while working and Cubii could provide a good outlet for him in this regard.”
KATRINA HENNESSY, Bellevue, Washington







"I was a strong believer of incidental exercise throughout the day and invested early to buy a Fibit Ultra back in 2012, before it became cool. However, at work I still felt the guilt of going for short walks down the corridor for the sake of exercise. The Cubii, now frees me of some of my guilt, and assists me in moving even while at my desk. I'm really looking to obtaining another 2-3 thousand steps in a day, to reach my 10 thousand step goal!"
MICHAEL CHAN, Canberra, Australia
