About Us


Spring Bank is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. The Company’s SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that are designed to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states. Spring Bank is developing its most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of viral diseases. The Company has designed SB 9200 to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acid-inducible gene 1, or RIG-I, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2, or NOD2, to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. Spring Bank believes that SB 9200 may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the body’s immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections.
In June 2016, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) to explore both monotherapy and combination therapy with a direct-acting antiviral (DAA). We anticipate topline data from this trial in the second quarter of 2017.

SB 9200 RSV and Other Development Programs


Subject to obtaining additional financing beyond the proceeds from our IPO, we plan to explore the development of SB 9200 for the treatment of RSV, HIV latency and HDV. If we determine to proceed with development of SB 9200 for RSV, we would expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of SB 9200 in otherwise healthy adult volunteers inoculated with RSV. If we determine to proceed with clinical development of SB 9200 for HIV latency, we would seek to collaborate with major research centers and third parties with significant expertise in HIV to explore the potential use of SB 9200 in the eradication of HIV. In addition, we believe that therapies such as SB 9200, which can reduce or cause loss of HBsAg, may play an important role in the treatment of HDV co-infected HBV patients.








RSV infection leads to 2.1 million outpatient visits and 57,000 hospitalizations among children younger than five years old.Learn more about RSV

	About Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals





	        We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our
	proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Our SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of
	specific proteins implicated in various disease states. We are developing our most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of certain viral diseases. We have designed SB 9200 to
	selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), to inhibit viral
	replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that SB 9200 may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the
	body's immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections. We are also developing other SMNH product candidates, including SB 11285, an immunotherapeutic agent for the
	treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes, or STING, pathway.






	SB 9200





	        We are currently developing SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We are conducting a Phase 2a multi-center
	clinical trial of SB 9200 in Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, which is the first segment of our Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial. The Phase 2a trial is a, randomized, placebo-controlled,
	multiple ascending dose trial in up to 80 non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV using doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg of SB 9200 as a
	monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks. Following this treatment, all patients will receive treatment with the oral antiviral agent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (marketed as
	Viread®, which we refer to as Viread) as a monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between a SB 9200 dose
	group or placebo on a 4:1 basis. Patients are stratified based on HBeAg positive (+) or negative () status. HBeAg is a non-structural protein which is secreted by the virus and whose
	presence in blood, or HBeAgpositive, is indicative of wild type or non-mutated virus with high levels of viral replication. The loss of HBeAg occurs secondary to mutations in the
	virus and results in a patient becoming HBeAg negative with a resulting lower level of actively replicating virus. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2a clinical trial are safety and antiviral
	activity, as measured by the change in HBV DNA at week 12 from baseline. Multiple exploratory secondary endpoints include reduction or loss of hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, and HBeAg,
	quantitative HBV RNA as a marker for control of virus production and studies of immune activity.




	        In
	May 2017, we reported top-line results from the first SB 9200 monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial indicating that a low dose (25mg) of SB 9200 alone showed
	a favorable safety profile and antiviral activity against HBV DNA and HBsAg. The first SB 9200 monotherapy dosing cohort consisted of 11 HBeAg-positive and 9 HBeAgnegative patients,
	of which 80% were genotype B/C, the most common Asian genotypes. Administration of SB 9200 resulted in a statistically





	S-5











	Table of Contents












	significant
	reduction in HBV DNA at week 12 (unpaired t-test 2.85, p=0.01) compared to placebo, with a mean reduction of 0.6 log

	10

	(range 0 to 1.87 log

	10

	) in the SB 9200
	treatment group. For the secondary endpoint of reduction or loss of HBsAg, 5 of 16 patients (31%) in the SB 9200 treatment group had a greater than 0.5 log

	10

	reduction at any time point
	(range 0.52 to 1.01 log

	10

	), compared to none in the placebo group. The 7 HBeAgnegative patients in the SB 9200 treatment group had the greatest mean reduction in HBV DNA
	at 0.9 log

	10

	, and 3 of these 7 patients also had a greater than 0.5 log

	10

	reduction in HBsAg. The overall safety profile of SB 9200 was favorable, and over the 12-week study,
	no serious adverse events were observed. Treatment-emergent adverse events ranged from mild to moderate in severity with no interferon-like side effects and were comparable to patients on placebo.




	        We
	expect to report top-line results from the second SB 9200 monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to report top-line
	monotherapy results for all
	patients treated with SB 9200 alone in the first half of 2018. Subject to the complete results of the Phase 2a clinical trial, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial in the
	second half of 2018 in patients with chronic HBV to explore the use of SB 9200 as a monotherapy and in combination with Viread. The Phase 2a clinical trial is being conducted under our clinical
	trial collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc., and the Phase 2b clinical trial will be conducted under the same collaboration.




	        We
	are also pursuing the development of the co-formulation of SB 9200 with Viread and with entecavir (marketed as Baraclude®, which we refer to as Baraclude) as potential
	fixed-dose combination products for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV who may benefit from the combined use of SB 9200 as a potential immunomodulatory agent, and Baraclude or Viread, as the
	antiviral agent. We anticipate that the fixed-dose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for a more favorable safety profile. We have conducted early
	development work on co-formulations with Viread and believe that SB 9200 with Viread is compatible in the same formulation. We believe that the immunomodulatory activity provided by SB 9200 could
	become a key component of a future combinatorial treatment of patients infected with chronic HBV, which could increase the percentage of chronic HBV patients who achieve a functional cure. We have
	entered into collaborations and seek to enter into additional collaborations with third parties that are investigating and/or developing compounds for the treatment of chronic HBV with different
	pharmacological mechanisms of action than SB 9200. Pursuant to this strategy, we have entered into agreements with multiple parties, including Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Arbutus
	Biopharma Corporation.






	SB 11285





	        We are developing SB 11285, a novel proprietary STING agonist, as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers.
	Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an aggressive and strong
	anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune response. In our preclinical studies performed in



	in vitro



	systems,
	SB 11285 has been observed to cause the induction of interferon and other cytokines, as well as cell death, or apoptosis, of multiple tumor-derived cell lines. We continue to conduct
	preclinical studies of SB 11285 in multiple



	in vivo



	cancer models. We presented data from



	in vivo



	studies in the A20 lymphoma and 4T1 breast cancer syngeneic mouse models at the March 2017 Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Keystone Symposia. In June 2017, an abstract was published at the
	American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting indicating that SB 11285 showed potent and highly-durable anti-tumor activity in the A20 and CT26 syngeneic mouse tumor models. The
	induction of immune-memory and abscopal anti-tumor activity upon intra-tumoral administration of SB 11285 was also observed in the A20 lymphoma model. In addition, SB 11285 exhibited dose-dependent,
	potent tumor growth inhibition and durable anti-tumor response upon intra-tumoral, intraperitoneal and intravenous routes of administration in the CT26 colon cancer syngeneic mouse model. In the
	orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model, intraperitoneal administration of SB 11285 resulted in significant





	S-6











	Table of Contents












	inhibition
	of primary tumor growth, as well as inhibition of tumor metastasis. We believe these preclinical studies demonstrate the potential for both intra-tumoral and systemic administration of
	SB 11285 to target a variety of tumors, which could potentially be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities.




	        We
	intend to continue the development of SB 11285 as a potentially important addition to the current standard of care in the treatment of various cancers that we believe could increase
	the treatment responses in patients. In 2017, we intend to continue to advance the SB 11285 program with preclinical, toxicology, and process development efforts and hope to achieve further
	preclinical proof-of-principle for SB 11285 in relevant oncology models. Subject to the results of these preclinical studies, we hope to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, and/or
	a clinical trial application, or CTA, for SB 11285 in mid-2018.

	Our Corporate Information





	        We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Spring Bank Technologies, Inc. on October 7, 2002. On
	May 12, 2008, we filed a certificate of incorporation in the State of Delaware and changed our state of incorporation to Delaware and our name to Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Our
	principal executive offices are located at 86 South Street, Hopkinton, MA 01748, and our telephone number is (508) 473-5993. Our website address is www.springbankpharm.com. The
	information contained in, or accessible through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.






	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company





	        The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted in April 2012 with the intention of encouraging capital formation
	in the United States and reducing the
	regulatory burden on newly public companies that qualify as "emerging growth companies." We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may
	take advantage of certain exemptions from various public reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be audited by our independent registered
	public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain requirements related to the disclosure of executive compensation in this prospectus and in our periodic
	reports and proxy statements, and the requirement that we hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive





	S-7











	Table of Contents












	compensation
	and any golden parachute payments. We may choose to take advantage of some, all or none of these reduced burdens until we are no longer an emerging growth company. As a result, the
	information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.




	        We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of:






	




	the last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or more in annual gross revenue;








	




	the date we qualify as a "large accelerated filer," with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;








	




	the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or








	




	the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering.






	        Section 102(b)(1)
	of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
	is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. We have chosen to "opt out" of the extended
	transition periods available under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended
	transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

	RISK FACTORS






	        



	Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should consider
	carefully the risks described below and under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, or SEC, on February 14, 2017, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, together with the other information contained in this prospectus supplement, the
	accompanying prospectus and in our other filings with the SEC that we have incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. If any of these risks occur, our
	business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline,
	and you may lose all or part of your investment.







	Risks Related to this Offering








	If you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution
	in the book value of your investment.






	        The price per share of our common stock in this offering may exceed the net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior
	to this offering. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you may pay a price per share that substantially exceeds our net tangible book value per share after this
	offering. To the extent shares are issued under outstanding options at exercise prices lower than the price of our common stock in this offering, you will incur further dilution. See the section
	entitled "Dilution" below for a more detailed illustration of the dilution you would incur if you participate in this offering.







	You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.






	        In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or
	exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share in this offering. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is
	less than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per
	share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid
	by investors in this offering.







	We have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive
	in this offering, and may not use them effectively.






	        Our management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds we receive in this offering, to fund our
	operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock.
	The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to
	decline and delay the development of our drug candidates. Pending their use to fund our operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from this offering, in a
	manner that does not produce income or that loses value.




	S-11











	Table of Contents








	Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that
	such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.






	        Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the
	market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. After this offering, we will have outstanding 12,310,853 shares of common
	stock based on 9,426,238 shares outstanding as of May 15, 2017. This includes the shares that we are selling in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately without
	restriction, unless purchased by our affiliates. Of the remaining shares, approximately 1,330,639 shares are subject to a contractual lock-up with the underwriters for this offering for 90 days
	immediately following the date of the final prospectus supplement for this offering. The representatives of the underwriters may, in their discretion, release the restrictions on any such shares at
	any time without notice. After the earlier of the expiration of, or release from, the lock-up period, the holders of these shares may at any time decide to sell their shares in the public market.







	Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you
	may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.






	        We intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations and expansion of our business and have no current plans to pay any cash
	dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of
	Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements,
	contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our Board of Directors
	may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay
	dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive
	any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.







	If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock
	or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.






	        The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our
	business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish
	inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us
	regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.






	Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates








	Interim, "top-line," and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to
	time may change as more patient data become available or as additional analyses are conducted, and as the data are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in
	the final data.






	        From time to time, we may publish interim, "top-line," or preliminary data from our clinical studies. For instance, in May 2017, we reported
	top-line results from the first SB 9200 monotherapy




	S-12











	Table of Contents





	dosing
	cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial, which is the first segment of our Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more
	of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or "top-line" data also remain subject to audit and verification
	procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until
	the final data are available. Material adverse changes between preliminary, "top-line," or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.

	USE OF PROCEEDS






	        We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock to the underwriters in this offering will be approximately
	$35.0 million ($40.3 million if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full), after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us.




	        We
	currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering:






	




	to advance the clinical development of SB 9200 and/or a fixed dose of SB 9200 in combination with a nucleoside(tide) to the initiation of a
	Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of HBV;








	




	to complete both preclinical and Phase 1b clinical trials of SB 11285 for the treatment of certain cancers; and








	




	for working capital and other general corporate purposes.






	        The
	expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and
	business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, feedback from regulatory
	authorities, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our drug candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
	result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for
	other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds.




	        Pending
	use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, interest-bearing instruments,
	investment-grade and U.S. government securities.

	DILUTION






	        If you invest in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering
	price per share and the as-adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering. We calculate net tangible book value per share by dividing the net
	tangible book value, which is tangible assets less total liabilities, by the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. Dilution represents the difference between the portion of the amount per
	share paid by purchasers of shares in this offering and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after giving effect to this offering. Our net tangible book
	value as of March 31, 2017 was approximately $10.9 million, or $1.17 per share.




	        After
	giving effect to the sale of our common stock pursuant to this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus in the aggregate amount of $37.5 million at an offering
	price of $13.00 per share, and after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us, our net tangible book value as of March 31, 2017 would have been
	$46.0 million, or $3.74 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in the net tangible book value of $2.57 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution
	in net tangible book value of $9.26 per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this per share dilution:

	        If
	the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 432,692 additional shares of our common stock in full at the public offering price of $13.00 per share, the net tangible book value
	per share after giving effect to the offering would be $4.03 per share. This represents an immediate increase in as adjusted net tangible book value of $2.86 per share to existing stockholders and an
	immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $8.97 per share to new investors purchasing shares of our common stock in this offering.




	        The
	above discussion and table are based on 9,416,472 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and excludes the
	following:






	




	966,300 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options outstanding as of March 31, 2017, at a weighted-average
	exercise price of $10.69 per share;








	




	1,798,084 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2017, at a weighted-average
	exercise price of $11.22 per share; and








	




	494,699 shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan as of March 31, 2017.






	        To
	the extent that any options are exercised, new equity awards are granted under our equity incentive plans or we otherwise issue additional shares of common stock in the future, there
	will be further dilution to new investors.




	        In
	addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future
	operating plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our
	stockholders.

	DIVIDEND POLICY






	        We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock since our inception. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any,
	to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our
	board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments, provisions of applicable
	law and other factors the board deems relevant.

	MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS






	        The following is a discussion of material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations applicable to non-U.S. holders with respect to their
	ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock. This discussion is for information only and is not tax advice. Accordingly, all prospective non-U.S. holders of our common stock should consult
	their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock. For purposes of this
	discussion, a non-U.S. holder means a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or other pass-through entity) of our common stock who is not, for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes:






	




	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;








	




	a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in the United States or
	under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof or the District of Columbia;








	




	an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or








	




	a trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more U.S. persons have
	the authority to control all of the trust's substantial decisions or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.






	        This
	discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, existing and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, current administrative rulings and judicial decisions,
	all as in effect as of the date of this prospectus supplement, all of which are subject to change or to differing interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any change could alter the tax
	consequences to non-U.S. holders described in this prospectus supplement. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, will not
	challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein. We assume in this discussion that a non-U.S. holder holds shares of our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
	Section 1221 of the Code (generally property held for investment).




	        This
	discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation that may be relevant to a particular non-U.S. holder in light of that non-U.S. holder's individual
	circumstances nor does it address the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income, or any aspects of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. taxes. This discussion also does not consider
	any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a non-U.S. holder and does not address the special tax rules applicable to particular non-U.S. holders, such
	as:






	




	insurance companies;








	




	tax-exempt organizations;








	




	financial institutions;








	




	brokers or dealers in securities;








	




	pension plans;








	




	controlled foreign corporations;








	




	passive foreign investment companies;








	




	owners that have elected to mark securities to market or that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction,
	synthetic security or other integrated investment;






	S-18











	Table of Contents







	




	holders who have acquired our common stock through the exercise of a stock option or otherwise as compensation; and








	




	certain U.S. expatriates.






	        In
	addition, this discussion does not address the tax treatment of partnerships or persons who hold our common stock through partnerships or other entities or arrangements that are
	treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity that will hold our common stock should consult his, her or its own tax
	advisor regarding the tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of our common stock through a partnership or other pass-through entity, as applicable.






	Distributions on Our Common Stock





	        Distributions on our common stock generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current
	or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. If a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a
	tax-free return of the non-U.S. holder's investment, up to such holder's tax basis in the common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain, subject to the tax treatment described
	below in "Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Stock." Any such distributions will also be subject to the discussion below under the section titled "Withholding and
	Information Reporting RequirementsFATCA."




	        Dividends
	paid to a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax
	treaty between the United States and such holder's country of residence. A non-U.S. holder of our common stock who claims the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and
	such holder's country of residence generally will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) and satisfy applicable certification and other
	requirements. A non-U.S. holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax under an income tax treaty may be able to obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts withheld by timely
	filing the required information with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.




	        Dividends
	that are treated as effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by a non-U.S. holder within the United States and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides,
	that are attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder within the United States, are generally exempt from the 30% withholding tax if the non-U.S. holder
	satisfies applicable certification and disclosure requirements. However, such U.S. effectively connected income, net of specified deductions and credits, is generally taxed at the same graduated U.S.
	federal income tax rates applicable to United States persons (as defined in the Code). Any U.S. effectively connected income received by a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also, under certain
	circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and such holder's
	country of residence.






	Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Our Common Stock





	        Subject to the discussion below under "Withholding and Information Reporting RequirementsFATCA," in general, a non-U.S. holder will
	not be subject to any U.S.
	federal income tax on any gain realized upon such holder's sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock unless:






	




	the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a U.S. trade or business and, if an applicable income tax treaty so
	provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment






	S-19











	Table of Contents







	or
	a fixed base maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States, in which case the non-U.S. holder generally will be taxed at the graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to United
	States persons (as defined in the Code) and, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, the branch profits tax described above in "Distributions on Our Common Stock" also may apply;






	




	the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
	the disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to a 30% tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between
	the United States and such holder's country of residence) on the net gain derived from the disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, if any;
	or








	




	we are, or have been, at any time during the five-year period preceding such disposition (or the non-U.S. holder's holding period, if shorter)
	a "U.S. real property holding corporation," unless our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market and the non-U.S. holder holds no more than 5% of our outstanding common
	stock, directly or indirectly, during the shorter of the 5-year period ending on the date of the disposition or the period that the non-U.S. holder held our common stock. If we are determined to be a
	U.S. real property holding corporation and the foregoing exception does not apply, then the non-U.S. holder generally will be taxed on its net gain derived from the disposition at the graduated U.S.
	federal income tax rates applicable to United States persons (as defined in the Code). Generally, a corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its U.S.
	real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Although
	there can be no assurance, we do not believe that we are, or have been, a U.S. real property holding corporation, or that we are likely to become one in the future. No assurance can be provided that
	our common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market for purposes of the rules described above.








	Backup Withholding and Information Reporting





	        We must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder the gross amount of the distributions on our common stock paid to such holder and
	the tax withheld, if any, with respect to such distributions. Non-U.S. holders may have to comply with specific certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a United States person (as
	defined in the Code) in order to avoid backup withholding at the applicable rate with respect to dividends on our common stock. Generally, a non-U.S. holder will comply with such procedures if it
	provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable Form W-8) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a non-U.S.
	holder, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Dividends paid to non-U.S. holders subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, as described above in "Distributions on Our Common Stock,"
	generally will be exempt from U.S. backup withholding.

	reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to the proceeds of a disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder effected by or through the U.S. office of any
	broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder and satisfies certain other requirements, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Generally, information reporting
	and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a non-U.S. holder where the transaction is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a broker.
	However, for information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to
	dispositions

	effected
	through a U.S. office of a broker. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.




	        Copies
	of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is incorporated under the provisions of a specific
	treaty or agreement.




	        Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder can be refunded or credited against the non-U.S.
	holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS.






	Withholding and Information Reporting RequirementsFATCA





	        Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA) generally impose a U.S. federal
	withholding tax at a rate of 30% on payments of dividends on, and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to certain foreign entities, unless (i) if the
	foreign entity is a "foreign financial institution," such foreign entity undertakes certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the foreign entity is
	not a "foreign financial institution," such foreign entity identifies certain of its U.S. investors, if any, or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise exempt under FATCA. Withholding under FATCA
	generally applies (1) to payments of dividends on our common stock and (2) to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock made after
	December 31, 2018. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify the FATCA rules described above. Non-U.S. holders should consult their
	own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on non-U.S. holders' investment in our common stock and the entities (including financial intermediaries) through which they hold our
	common stock.






	U.S. Federal Estate Tax





	        Shares of our common stock that are owned or treated as owned at the time of death by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the
	United States, as specifically defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, are considered U.S. situs assets and will be included in the individual's
	gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes. Such shares, therefore, may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax, unless an applicable estate tax or other treaty provides otherwise.




	        



	The preceding discussion of material U.S. federal tax considerations is for information only. It is not tax advice. Prospective investors should consult their own
	tax advisors regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of purchasing, owning, and disposing of our common stock, including the consequences of any proposed
	changes in applicable laws.

	        The
	underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters are subject to certain conditions precedent such as the receipt by the underwriters of officers' certificates
	and legal opinions and approval of certain legal matters by their counsel. The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters, severally and not jointly, will purchase all of the shares of
	common stock if any of them are purchased. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters and certain of their controlling persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
	Act, and to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.




	        The
	underwriters are offering the shares of common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares of common stock from us and subject to prior sale. The underwriters reserve the right
	to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.






	Option to Purchase Additional Shares





	        We have granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, to purchase, from time
	to time, in whole or in part, up to an aggregate of 432,692 additional shares from us at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, less underwriting
	discounts and commissions. If the underwriters exercise this option, each underwriter will be obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase a number of additional shares approximately
	proportionate to that underwriter's initial purchase commitment as indicated in the table above.






	Commissions and Expenses





	        The underwriters have advised us that they propose to offer the shares of common stock to the public at the public offering price set forth on
	the cover page of this prospectus supplement and to certain dealers, which may include the underwriters, at that price less a concession not in excess of $0.468 per share of common stock.

	agreed to reimburse the underwriters for certain expenses incurred by them in connection with this offering in an amount up to an aggregate of $25,000. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110, this
	reimbursed expense is deemed underwriting compensation for this offering. JMP Securities LLC has provided financial advisory services to us in connection with this offering.






	Listing





	        Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol "SBPH."






	Stamp Taxes





	        If you purchase shares of common stock offered in this prospectus supplement, you may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges under the
	laws and practices of the country of purchase, in addition to the offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement.






	No Sales of Similar Securities





	        We and our executive officers and directors have agreed, subject to specified exceptions, not to directly or indirectly, for a period of
	90 days after the date of the underwriting agreement:






	




	sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including any short sale), pledge, transfer, establish an open "put equivalent position"
	within the meaning of Rule 16a-l(h) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;








	




	otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock, options or warrants to acquire shares of common stock, or securities exchangeable or
	exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock currently or hereafter owned either of record or beneficially;








	




	enter into any swap, hedge or other agreement or transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequence of ownership of
	common stock, or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock; or








	




	publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement without
	the prior written consent of the representatives.






	        This
	restriction terminates after the close of trading of the common stock on and includes the 90

	th

	 day after the date of this prospectus supplement.




	        The
	representatives may, in their sole discretion and at any time or from time to time before the termination of the 90-day period release all or any portion of the securities subject to
	lock-up agreements. There are no existing agreements between the underwriters and any of our shareholders




	S-23











	Table of Contents





	who
	will execute a lock-up agreement, providing consent to the sale of shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up period.






	Stabilization





	        The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, certain persons
	participating in the offering may engage in short sale transactions, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions or the imposition of penalty bids in connection with this offering. These
	activities may have the effect of stabilizing or maintaining the market price of the common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. Establishing short sales
	positions may involve either "covered" short sales or "naked" short sales.




	        "Covered"
	short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in this offering. The underwriters may close
	out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock or purchasing shares of our common stock in the open market. In determining the
	source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at
	which they may purchase shares through the option to purchase additional shares.




	        "Naked"
	short sales are sales in excess of the option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in
	the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares of our common stock in the open
	market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.




	        A
	stabilizing bid is a bid for the purchase of shares of common stock on behalf of the underwriters for the purpose of fixing or maintaining the price of the common stock. A syndicate
	covering transaction is the bid for or the purchase of shares of common stock on behalf of the underwriters to reduce a short position incurred by the underwriters in connection with the offering.
	Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters' purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing
	or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. A penalty bid is
	an arrangement permitting the underwriters to reclaim the selling concession otherwise accruing to a syndicate member in connection with the offering if the common stock originally sold by such
	syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction and therefore have not been effectively placed by such syndicate member.




	        Neither
	we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our
	common stock. The underwriters are not obligated to engage in these activities and, if commenced, any of the activities may be discontinued at any time.






	Passive Market Making





	        The underwriters may also engage in passive market making transactions in our common stock on the NASDAQ in accordance with Rule 103 of
	Regulation M during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of shares of our common stock in this offering and extending through the completion of distribution. A passive market
	maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid of that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered
	below the passive market maker's bid, that bid must then be lowered when specified purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making may cause the price of our common stock to be higher than the
	price that otherwise




	S-24











	Table of Contents





	would
	exist in the open market in the absence of those transactions. The underwriters are not required to engage in passive market making and, if commenced, may end passive market making activities at
	any time.






	Electronic Distribution





	        A prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in electronic format may be made available by e-mail or on the web sites or through
	online services maintained by the underwriters or their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering terms online and may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may
	agree with us to allocate a specific number of shares of common stock for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be made by the underwriter on the
	same basis as other allocations. Other than the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in electronic format, the information on the underwriters' web sites and any information contained
	in any other web site maintained by the underwriters is not part of this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, has not been approved and/or endorsed by us or the underwriter and
	should not be relied upon by investors.






	Other Activities and Relationships





	        The underwriters and certain of their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in a wide range of activities for
	their own accounts and the accounts of customers, which may include, among other things, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, merchant banking, equity and fixed income sales, trading and
	research, derivatives, foreign exchange, futures, asset management, custody, clearance and securities lending. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and
	may in the future perform, various investment banking and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.




	        In
	addition, in the ordinary course of its business, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions, trade and otherwise
	conduct such activities in or with respect to debt or equity securities and/or bank debt of, and/or derivative products. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and
	instruments. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and
	may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS






	        This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, utilizing a "shelf"
	registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we may offer shares of our common stock and preferred stock, various series of debt securities and/or warrants, rights or purchase
	contracts to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in units, in one or more offerings, with a total value of up to $150,000,000. This prospectus provides you with a general
	description of the securities we may offer. Each time we offer a type or series of securities under this prospectus, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information
	about the terms of that offering.




	        This
	prospectus does not contain all of the information included in the registration statement. For a more complete understanding of the offering of the securities, you should refer to
	the registration statement, including its exhibits. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. However, no
	prospectus
	supplement will offer a security that is not registered and described in this prospectus at the time of its effectiveness. This prospectus, together with the applicable prospectus supplements and the
	documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, includes all material information relating to the offering of securities under this prospectus. You should carefully read this prospectus, the
	applicable prospectus supplement, the information and documents incorporated herein by reference and the additional information under the heading "Where You Can Find More Information" before making an
	investment decision.




	        You
	should rely only on the information we have provided or incorporated by reference in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with
	information different from that contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. No dealer, salesperson or other person is authorized to give any information or to represent anything not
	contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You must not rely on any unauthorized information or representation. This prospectus is an offer to sell only the securities offered hereby,
	but only under circumstances and in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. You should assume that the information in this prospectus or any prospectus supplement is accurate only as of the date on
	the front of the document and that any information we have incorporated herein by reference is accurate only as of the date of the document incorporated by reference, regardless of the time of
	delivery of this prospectus or any sale of a security.




	        We
	further note that the representations, warranties and covenants made by us in any agreement that is filed as an exhibit to any document that is incorporated by reference in the
	accompanying prospectus were made solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, including, in some cases, for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties to such agreements, and should
	not be deemed to be a representation, warranty or covenant to you. Moreover, such representations, warranties or covenants were accurate only as of the date when made. Accordingly, such
	representations, warranties and covenants should not be relied on as accurately representing the current state of our affairs.




	        This
	prospectus may not be used to consummate sales of our securities, unless it is accompanied by a prospectus supplement. To the extent there are inconsistencies between any prospectus
	supplement, this prospectus and any documents incorporated by reference, the document with the most recent date will control.




	        Unless
	the context otherwise requires, "Spring Bank," "SBPH," "the Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our subsidiaries.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY






	        



	The following is a summary of what we believe to be the most important aspects of our business and the offering of our
	securities under this prospectus. We urge you to read this entire prospectus, including the more detailed consolidated financial statements, notes to the consolidated financial statements and other
	information incorporated by reference from our other filings with the SEC or included in any applicable prospectus supplement. Investing in our securities involves risks. Therefore, carefully consider
	the risk factors set forth in any prospectus supplements and in our most recent annual and quarterly filings with the SEC, as well as other information in this prospectus and any prospectus
	supplements and the documents incorporated by reference herein or therein, before purchasing our securities. Each of the risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and
	financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.








	About Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals






	        We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our
	proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. Our SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of
	specific proteins implicated in various disease states. We are developing our most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of certain viral diseases. We have designed SB 9200 to
	selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), to inhibit viral
	replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense. We believe that SB 9200 may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the
	body's immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections. We are also developing other SMNH product candidates, including SB 11285, an immunotherapeutic agent for the
	treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes, or STING, pathway.






	SB 9200





	        We are currently developing SB 9200 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We are conducting a Phase 2a multi-center
	clinical trial of SB 9200 in Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. The trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial in up to 80 non-cirrhotic patients infected with
	chronic HBV using doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200
	mg of SB 9200 as a monotherapy administered daily for 12 weeks. Following this treatment, all patients will receive treatment with the oral antiviral agent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
	(marketed as Viread®, which we refer to as Viread) as a monotherapy for 12 weeks. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between a
	SB 9200 dose group or placebo on a 4:1 basis. Patients will be stratified based on HBeAg+/ status. HBeAg is a non-structural protein whose presence in blood, or HBeAg+, is indicative
	of actively replicating virus. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2a clinical trial are safety and reduction in HBV DNA from pre-treatment levels with multiple exploratory secondary endpoints,
	including reduction or loss of hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, and HBeAg, both of which are important markers of viral replication and early surrogate markers for functional cure. In June 2016,
	we initiated our Phase 2a ACHIEVE clinical trial in non-cirrhotic patients infected with chronic HBV, and in May 2017, we reported top-line results from the first
	SB 9200 monotherapy dosing cohort of the Phase 2a clinical trial, which indicated that a low dose (25mg) of SB 9200 alone showed a favorable safety profile and antiviral activity
	against HBV DNA and HBsAg.




	        We
	are also pursuing the development of the co-formulation of SB 9200 with entecavir (marketed as Baraclude®, which we refer to as Baraclude) and Viread as potential
	fixed-dose combination products for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV who may benefit from the combined use of





	2











	Table of Contents












	SB
	9200 as an immunomodulatory agent, and Baraclude or Viread, as the antiviral agent. We anticipate that the fixed-dose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially
	allow for the delivery of lower doses of the individual compounds for equivalent efficacy and a more favorable safety profile. We have conducted early development work on co-formulations with
	Baraclude and Viread and believe that SB 9200 and these antiviral agents are compatible in the same formulation. We believe that the immunomodulatory activity provided by SB 9200 could be a key
	component of a future combinatorial treatment of patients infected with chronic HBV, which could increase the percentage of chronic HBV patients who achieve a functional cure. We have entered into
	collaborations and seek to enter into additional collaborations with third parties that are investigating and/or developing compounds for the treatment of chronic HBV with different pharmacological
	mechanisms of action than SB 9200. Pursuant to this strategy, we entered into agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Arbutus Biopharma Corporation.






	SB 11285





	        We are developing SB 11285, a novel proprietary STING agonist, as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers.
	Recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the STING pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an aggressive and strong
	anti-tumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune response. In our studies performed in



	in vitro



	cancer models, SB 11285 was shown
	to cause the induction of interferon and other cytokines and cell death, or apoptosis, of multiple tumor-derived cell lines. We continue to conduct preclinical studies of SB 11285 in multiple



	in vivo



	cancer models. In March 2017, we presented data from certain of these



	in vivo



	studies at the
	2017 Keystone Symposia on Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy indicating that SB 11285 showed anti-tumor activity in a 4T1 breast cancer syngeneic mouse model and an A20 lymphoma model.







	Additional Information






	        For additional information related to our business and operations, please refer to the reports incorporated herein by reference, including our
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as described under the caption "Incorporation of Documents by Reference" on page 28 of this prospectus.







	Risks Associated with Our Business






	        Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section entitled "Risk Factors" immediately
	following this prospectus summary. Some of these risks are:






	




	we have a history of limited operations, have incurred significant losses since our inception, expect to incur losses for the foreseeable
	future and may never achieve or maintain profitability;








	




	we will need additional funding to complete the development of our product candidates and, if our products are approved by the FDA or other
	applicable regulatory authorities, before we can expect to become profitable from the commercial sale of our products. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay,
	reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts;








	




	our business currently depends substantially on the success of clinical trials for SB 9200, which is still under development. If we are unable
	to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize SB 9200, our business will be materially harmed;








	




	we are very early in our development efforts and our product candidates may not be successful in later stage clinical trials. As a result, they
	may never be approved as marketable therapeutics;







	3











	Table of Contents














	




	we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our product candidates for
	preclinical and clinical testing. These third parties may not perform satisfactorily, which could delay our product development activities;








	




	if we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology, or obtain and maintain issued patents which are sufficient to protect our
	product candidates, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects; and








	




	we may not be able to retain key executives or to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.






	        It
	is difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.







	Our Corporate Information






	        We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Spring Bank Technologies, Inc. on October 7, 2002. On
	May 12, 2008, we filed a certificate of incorporation in the State of Delaware and changed our state of incorporation to Delaware and our name to Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Our
	principal executive offices are located at 86 South Street, Hopkinton, MA 01748, and our telephone number is (508) 473-5993. Our website address is www.springbankpharm.com. The
	information contained in, or accessible through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.




	        All
	brand names or trademarks appearing in this prospectus are the property of their respective holders. Use or display by us of other parties' trademarks, trade dress, or products in
	this prospectus is not intended to, and does not, imply a relationship with, or endorsements or sponsorship of, us by the trademark or trade dress owners.







	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company






	        The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted in April 2012 with the intention of encouraging capital formation
	in the United States and reducing the regulatory burden on newly public companies that qualify as "emerging growth companies." We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the JOBS Act. As
	an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be
	audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain requirements related to the disclosure of executive compensation
	in this prospectus and in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirement that we hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may
	choose to take advantage of some, all or none of these reduced burdens until we are no longer an emerging growth company. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be
	different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. .




	        We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of:






	




	the last day of the fiscal year in which we have approximately $1.0 billion or more in annual gross revenue;








	




	the date we qualify as a "large accelerated filer," with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;








	




	the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or







	4











	Table of Contents














	




	the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering.






	        Section 102(b)(1)
	of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
	is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. We have chosen to "opt out" of the extended transition

	RISK FACTORS






	        Investing in our securities involves significant risk. The prospectus supplement applicable to each offering of our securities will contain a
	discussion of the risks applicable to an investment in Spring Bank. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific factors discussed under the
	heading "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus supplement, together with all of the other information contained or incorporated by reference in the prospectus supplement or appearing or
	incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" included in our most recent annual report on
	Form 10-K, as revised or supplemented by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or our current reports on Form 8-K that we have filed with the SEC, all of which are
	incorporated herein by reference, and which may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. The risks and uncertainties we have
	described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of
	these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the offered securities.















	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES






	        Any time debt securities or preferred securities are offered pursuant to this prospectus, we will provide a table setting forth our ratio of
	earnings to fixed charges, or combined fixed charges and preference dividends to earnings, if applicable, on a historical basis in the applicable prospectus supplement, if required.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	        This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus,
	including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, product candidates, product approvals, research and development costs, timing and likelihood
	of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations and future results of anticipated products, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks,
	uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
	implied by the forward-looking statements.




	        In
	some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "could," "intend," "target," "project,"
	"contemplate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus are only
	predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions
	described under the sections in our periodic report reports, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, entitled "Risk Factors" and
	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as other sections elsewhere in this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the
	documents or reports incorporated by reference in this prospectus.




	        Because
	forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should
	not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results
	could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it
	is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained
	herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.




	        You
	should read this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement, the documents that we reference in this prospectus and the documents we have filed as exhibits to the
	registration statement with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary
	statements.

	USE OF PROCEEDS






	        Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use any net proceeds from the sale of securities under this
	prospectus to fund activities relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and for other general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital,
	capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, should we choose to pursue any, and collaborations. We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the areas listed above or the timing
	of these expenditures. As a result, our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds, if any, we receive in connection with securities offered pursuant to this prospectus for any
	purpose. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we may initially invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities or apply them to the
	reduction of short-term indebtedness. Additional information on the use of proceeds from the sale of securities offered by this prospectus may be set forth in the prospectus supplement relating to
	that offering.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        We may offer securities under this prospectus from time to time pursuant to underwritten public offerings, negotiated transactions, block trades
	or a combination of these methods. We may sell the securities (1) through underwriters or dealers, (2) through agents or (3) directly to one or more purchasers, or through a
	combination of such methods. We may distribute the securities from time to time in one or more transactions at:






	




	a fixed price or prices, which may be changed from time to time;








	




	market prices prevailing at the time of sale;








	




	prices related to the prevailing market prices; or








	




	negotiated prices.






	        We
	may directly solicit offers to purchase the securities being offered by this prospectus. We may also designate agents to solicit offers to purchase the securities from time to time,
	and may enter into arrangements for "at-the-market," equity line or similar transactions. We will name in a prospectus supplement any underwriter or agent involved in the offer or sale of the
	securities.




	        If
	we utilize a dealer in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, we will sell the securities to the dealer, as principal. The dealer may then resell the securities
	to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.




	        If
	we utilize an underwriter in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, we will execute an underwriting agreement with the underwriter at the time of sale, and we
	will provide the name of any underwriter in the prospectus supplement which the underwriter will use to make resales of the securities to the public. In connection with the sale of the securities, we,
	or the purchasers of the securities for whom the underwriter may act as agent, may compensate the underwriter in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions. The underwriter may sell the
	securities to or through dealers, and the underwriter may compensate those dealers in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions.




	        With
	respect to underwritten public offerings, negotiated transactions and block trades, we will provide in the applicable prospectus supplement information regarding any compensation we
	pay to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers. Underwriters,
	dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts and commissions received by them and
	any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions. We may enter into agreements to indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against
	civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments they may be required to make in respect thereof.




	        If
	so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will authorize underwriters, dealers or other persons acting as our agents to solicit offers by certain institutions to
	purchase securities from us pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date stated in each applicable prospectus supplement. Each contract will be for an amount
	not less than, and the aggregate amount of securities sold pursuant to such contracts shall not be less nor more than, the respective amounts stated in each applicable prospectus supplement.
	Institutions with whom the contracts, when authorized, may be made include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, educational and charitable
	institutions and other institutions, but shall in all




	9











	Table of Contents





	cases
	be subject to our approval. Delayed delivery contracts will not be subject to any conditions except that:






	




	the purchase by an institution of the securities covered under that contract shall not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of
	the jurisdiction to which that institution is subject; and








	




	if the securities are also being sold to underwriters acting as principals for their own account, the underwriters shall have purchased such
	securities not sold for delayed delivery. The underwriters and other persons acting as our agents will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of delayed delivery
	contracts.






	        One
	or more firms, referred to as "remarketing firms," may also offer or sell the securities, if a prospectus supplement so indicates, in connection with a remarketing arrangement upon
	their purchase. Remarketing firms will act as principals for their own accounts or as our agents. These remarketing firms will offer or sell the securities in accordance with the terms of the
	securities. Each prospectus supplement will identify and describe any remarketing firm and the terms of its agreement, if any, with us and will describe the remarketing firm's compensation.
	Remarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters in connection with the securities they remarket. Remarketing firms may be entitled under agreements that may be entered into with us to
	indemnification by us against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and may be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary
	course of business.




	        Certain
	underwriters may use this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement for offers and sales related to market-making transactions in the securities. These underwriters
	may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and the sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of sale. Any underwriters involved in the sale of the
	securities may qualify as "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. In addition, the underwriters' commissions, discounts or concessions may qualify as
	underwriters' compensation under the Securities Act and the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA.




	        Shares
	of our common stock sold pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part will be authorized for listing and trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The
	applicable prospectus supplement will contain information, where applicable, as to any other listing, if any, on The NASDAQ Capital Market or any securities market or other securities exchange of the
	securities covered by the prospectus supplement. Underwriters may make a market in our common stock, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without
	notice. We can make no assurance as to the liquidity of or the existence, development or maintenance of trading markets for any of the securities.




	        In
	order to facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of
	the securities. This may
	include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than we sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons
	would cover such over-allotments or short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price
	of the securities by bidding for or purchasing the applicable security in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may
	be reclaimed if the securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the
	securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time.




	        The
	underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in other transactions with us, or perform other services for us, in the ordinary course of their business.

	the affirmative vote of our stockholders having a majority in voting power of the votes cast by the stockholders present or represented and voting on such matter, except as otherwise disclosed below.




	        Our
	bylaws provide that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, if present in person or by proxy, represent a quorum for the transaction of business at
	stockholders meetings, except where a separate vote by a class of capital stock is required, the holders of a majority in voting power of such class, if present by remote communication or by proxy,
	represent a quorum for such matter. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to
	receive ratably any dividends declared by our board of directors. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets
	remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then-outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive or conversion rights, or
	other subscription rights. There are no redemption provisions applicable to the common stock.

	DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK






	        We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. As of the date of this prospectus, no shares of
	our preferred stock were outstanding or designated. The following summary of certain provisions of our preferred stock does not purport to be complete. You should refer to our restated certificate of
	incorporation and our restated bylaws, both of which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. The summary below is also qualified by provisions of
	applicable law.







	General






	        Our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, from time to time, direct the issuance of shares of preferred stock in
	series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the rights, preferences and limitations of each series, including voting rights, dividend rights and redemption and liquidation preferences.
	Satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares of preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends on shares of our common stock. Holders of
	shares of preferred stock may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company before any payment is made to the holders of shares
	of our common stock. In some circumstances, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of control
	by a holder of a large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent management. Upon the affirmative vote of our board of directors, without stockholder approval, we may issue shares of
	preferred stock with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the holders of shares of our common stock.




	        If
	we offer a specific series of preferred stock under this prospectus, we will describe the terms of the preferred stock in the prospectus supplement for such offering and will
	file a copy of the restated certificate establishing the terms of the preferred stock with the SEC. To the extent required, this description will
	include:






	




	the title and stated value;








	




	the number of shares offered, the liquidation preference, if any, per share and the purchase price;








	




	the dividend rate(s), period(s) and/or payment date(s), or method(s) of calculation for such dividends;

	




	the procedures for any auction and remarketing, if any;








	




	the provisions for a sinking fund, if any;








	




	the provisions for redemption, if applicable;








	

	




	whether the preferred stock will be convertible into our common stock, and, if applicable, the conversion price (or how it will be calculated)
	and conversion period;








	




	whether the preferred stock will be exchangeable into debt securities, and, if applicable, the exchange price (or how it will be calculated)
	and exchange period;








	




	voting rights, if any, of the preferred stock;






	12











	Table of Contents







	

	




	the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
	affairs of the Company; and

	stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company.

	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES






	        The following description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplements, summarizes the material
	terms and provisions of the debt securities that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any future debt securities we may offer pursuant
	to this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any debt securities that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. If we so indicate in a prospectus supplement,
	the terms of any debt securities offered under such prospectus supplement may differ from the terms we describe below, and to the extent the terms set forth in a prospectus supplement differ from the
	terms described below, the terms set forth in the prospectus supplement shall control.




	        We
	may sell from time to time, in one or more offerings under this prospectus, debt securities, which may be senior or subordinated. We will issue any such senior debt securities under a
	senior indenture that we will enter into with a trustee to be named in the senior indenture. We will issue any such subordinated debt securities under a subordinated indenture, which we will enter
	into with a trustee to be named in the subordinated indenture. We have filed forms of these documents as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part. We use the term
	"indentures" to refer to either the senior indenture or the subordinated indenture, as applicable. The indentures will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect on the date of
	the indenture. We use the term "debenture trustee" to refer to either the trustee under the senior indenture or the trustee under the subordinated indenture, as applicable.




	        The
	following summaries of material provisions of the senior debt securities, the subordinated debt securities and the indentures are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by
	reference to, all the provisions of the indenture applicable to a particular series of debt securities.







	General






	        Each indenture provides that debt securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series and may be denominated and payable in foreign
	currencies or units based on or relating to foreign currencies. Neither indenture limits the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder and each indenture provides that the specific terms
	of any series of debt securities shall be set forth in, or determined pursuant to, an authorizing resolution and/or a supplemental indenture, if any, relating to such series.




	        We
	will describe in each prospectus supplement the following terms relating to a series of debt securities:






	




	the title or designation;








	




	the aggregate principal amount and any limit on the amount that may be issued;








	




	the currency or units based on or relating to currencies in which debt securities of such series are denominated and the currency or units in
	which principal or interest or both will or may be payable;








	




	whether we will issue the series of debt securities in global form, the terms of any global securities and who the depositary will be;








	




	the maturity date and the date or dates on which principal will be payable;








	




	the interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, or the method for determining the rate and the date interest will begin to accrue, the date
	or dates interest will be payable and the record dates for interest payment dates or the method for determining such dates;






	14











	Table of Contents







	




	whether or not the debt securities will be secured or unsecured, and the terms of any secured debt;








	




	the terms of the subordination of any series of subordinated debt;








	




	the place or places where payments will be payable;








	




	our right, if any, to defer payment of interest and the maximum length of any such deferral period;








	




	the date, if any, after which, and the price at which, we may, at our option, redeem the series of debt securities pursuant to any optional
	redemption provisions;








	




	the date, if any, on which, and the price at which we are obligated, pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund provisions or otherwise, to redeem,
	or at the holder's option to purchase, the series of debt securities;








	




	whether the indenture will restrict our ability to pay dividends, or will require us to maintain any asset ratios or reserves;








	




	whether we will be restricted from incurring any additional indebtedness;








	




	a discussion of any material or special U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to a series of debt securities;








	




	the denominations in which we will issue the series of debt securities, if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple
	thereof; and








	




	any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of, or restrictions on, the debt securities.






	        We
	may issue debt securities that provide for an amount less than their stated principal amount to be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of their maturity pursuant to the
	terms of the indenture. We will provide you with information on the federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any of these debt securities in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.







	Conversion or Exchange Rights






	        We will set forth in the prospectus supplement the terms, if any, on which a series of debt securities may be convertible into or exchangeable
	for our common stock or our other securities. We will include provisions as to whether conversion or exchange is mandatory, at the option of the holder or at our option. We may include provisions
	pursuant to which the number of shares of our common stock or our other securities that the holders of the series of debt securities receive would be subject to adjustment.







	Consolidation, Merger or Sale; No Protection in Event of a Change of Control or Highly Leveraged
	Transaction






	        The indentures do not contain any covenant that restricts our ability to merge or consolidate, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of
	all or substantially all of our assets. However, any successor to or acquirer of such assets must assume all of our obligations under the indentures or the debt securities, as appropriate.




	        Unless
	we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any provisions that may afford holders of the debt securities protection in the
	event we have a change of control or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction (whether or not such transaction results in a change of control), which could adversely affect holders of debt
	securities.

	event of default with respect to a particular series of debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an event of
	default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The occurrence of an event of default may constitute an event of default under any bank credit agreements we may have in existence from
	time to time. In addition, the occurrence of certain events of default or an acceleration under the indenture may constitute an event of default under certain of our other indebtedness outstanding
	from time to time.




	        If
	an event of default with respect to debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in
	principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may, by a notice in writing to us (and to the debenture trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately
	the principal (or, if the debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of and premium and accrued and
	unpaid interest, if any, on all debt securities of that series. Before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained with respect to debt securities of any series, the holders of
	a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series (or, at a meeting of holders of such series at which a quorum is present, the holders of a majority in principal amount
	of the debt securities of such series represented at such meeting) may rescind and annul the acceleration if all events of default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium, if
	any, and interest, if any, with respect to debt securities of that series, have been cured or waived as provided in the applicable indenture (including payments or deposits in respect of principal,
	premium or interest that had become due other than as a result of such acceleration). We refer you to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities that are discount securities
	for the particular provisions relating to acceleration of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an event of default.




	        Subject
	to the terms of the indentures, if an event of default under an indenture shall occur and be continuing, the debenture trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its
	rights or powers under such indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the applicable series of debt securities, unless such holders have offered the debenture trustee reasonable
	indemnity. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
	remedy available to the
	debenture trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the debenture trustee, with respect to the debt securities of that series, provided that:






	




	the direction so given by the holder is not in conflict with any law or the applicable indenture; and






	16











	Table of Contents







	




	subject to its duties under the Trust Indenture Act, the debenture trustee need not take any action that might involve it in personal liability
	or might be unduly prejudicial to the holders not involved in the proceeding.






	        A
	holder of the debt securities of any series will only have the right to institute a proceeding under the indentures or to appoint a receiver or trustee, or to seek other remedies
	if:






	




	the holder previously has given written notice to the debenture trustee of a continuing event of default with respect to that series;








	




	the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request,
	and such holders have offered reasonable indemnity to the debenture trustee to institute the proceeding as trustee; and








	




	the debenture trustee does not institute the proceeding, and does not receive from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
	the outstanding debt securities of that series (or at a meeting of holders of such series at which a quorum is present, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of such
	series represented at such meeting) other conflicting directions within 60 days after the notice, request and offer.






	        These
	limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder of debt securities if we default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on, the debt securities.




	        We
	will periodically file statements with the applicable debenture trustee regarding our compliance with specified covenants in the applicable indenture.







	Modification of Indenture; Waiver






	        The debenture trustee and we may change the applicable indenture without the consent of any holders with respect to specific matters,
	including:






	




	to fix any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture; and








	




	to change anything that does not materially adversely affect the interests of any holder of debt securities of any series issued pursuant to
	such indenture.






	        In
	addition, under the indentures, the rights of holders of a series of debt securities may be changed by us and the debenture trustee with the written consent of the holders of at least
	a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series (or, at a meeting of holders of such series at which a quorum is present, the holders of a majority in
	principal amount of the debt securities of such series represented at such meeting) that is affected. However, the debenture trustee and we may make the following changes only with the consent of each
	holder of any outstanding debt securities affected:






	




	extending the fixed maturity of the series of debt securities;








	




	reducing the principal amount, reducing the rate of or extending the time of payment of interest, or any premium payable upon the redemption of
	any debt securities;








	




	reducing the principal amount of discount securities payable upon acceleration of maturity;








	




	making the principal of or premium or interest on any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt security; or








	




	reducing the percentage of debt securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any amendment or waiver.






	        Except
	for certain specified provisions, the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series (or, at a meeting of holders of such
	series at which a quorum




	17











	Table of Contents





	is
	present, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of such series represented at such meeting) may on behalf of the holders of all debt securities of that series waive
	our compliance with provisions of the indenture. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all the debt securities
	of such series waive any past default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences,
	except a default in the payment of the principal of, premium or any interest on any debt security of that series or in respect of a covenant or provision, which cannot be modified or amended without
	the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of the series affected;



	provided



	,



	however



	,
	that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that
	resulted from the acceleration.







	Discharge






	        Each indenture provides that we can elect to be discharged from our obligations with respect to one or more series of debt securities, except
	for obligations to:






	




	register the transfer or exchange of debt securities of the series;








	




	replace stolen, lost or mutilated debt securities of the series;








	




	maintain paying agencies;








	




	hold monies for payment in trust;








	




	compensate and indemnify the trustee; and








	




	appoint any successor trustee.






	        In
	order to exercise our rights to be discharged with respect to a series, we must deposit with the trustee money or government obligations sufficient to pay all the principal of, the
	premium, if any, and interest on, the debt securities of the series on the dates payments are due.







	Form, Exchange, and Transfer






	        We will issue the debt securities of each series only in fully registered form without coupons and, unless we otherwise specify in the
	applicable prospectus supplement, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. The indentures provide that we may issue debt securities of a series in temporary or permanent global
	form and as book-entry securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company or another depositary named by us and identified in a prospectus supplement with respect to
	that series.




	        At
	the option of the holder, subject to the terms of the indentures and the limitations applicable to global securities described in the applicable prospectus supplement, the holder of
	the debt securities of any series can exchange the debt securities for other debt securities of the same series, in any authorized denomination and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.




	        Subject
	to the terms of the indentures and the limitations applicable to global securities set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the debt securities may present
	the debt securities for exchange or for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly executed if so required by us or the security registrar, at the
	office of the security registrar or at the office of any transfer agent designated by us for this purpose. Unless otherwise provided in the debt securities that the holder presents for transfer or
	exchange or in the applicable indenture, we will make no service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange, but we may require payment of any taxes or other governmental charges.




	18











	Table of Contents





	        We
	will name in the applicable prospectus supplement the security registrar, and any transfer agent in addition to the security registrar, that we initially designate for any debt
	securities. We may at any time
	designate additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts, except that we will be required to
	maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for the debt securities of each series.




	        If
	we elect to redeem the debt securities of any series, we will not be required to:






	




	issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any debt securities of that series during a period beginning at the opening of business
	15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of any debt securities that may be selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing; or








	




	register the transfer of or exchange any debt securities so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any
	debt securities we are redeeming in part.









	Information Concerning the Debenture Trustee






	        The debenture trustee, other than during the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the applicable indenture, undertakes to
	perform only those duties as are specifically set forth in the applicable indenture. Upon an event of default under an indenture, the debenture trustee under such indenture must use the same degree of
	care as a prudent person would exercise or use in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to this provision, the debenture trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the powers given it
	by the indentures at the request of any holder of debt securities unless it is offered reasonable security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that it might incur.







	Payment and Paying Agents






	        Unless we otherwise indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will make payment of the interest on any debt securities on any
	interest payment date to the person in whose name the debt securities, or one or more predecessor securities, are registered at the close of business on the regular record date for the interest.




	        We
	will pay principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities of a particular series at the office of the paying agents designated by us, except that unless we otherwise
	indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, will we make interest payments by check which we will mail to the holder. Unless we otherwise indicate in a prospectus supplement, we will designate
	the corporate trust office of the debenture trustee in the City of New York as our sole paying agent for payments with respect to debt securities of each series. We will name in the applicable
	prospectus supplement any other paying agents that we initially designate for the debt securities of a particular series. We will maintain a paying agent in each place of payment for the debt
	securities of a particular series.




	        All
	money we pay to a paying agent or the debenture trustee for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any debt securities which remains unclaimed at the end of
	two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the holder of the security thereafter may look only to us for payment thereof.







	Governing Law






	        The indentures and the debt securities will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except to the
	extent that the Trust Indenture Act is applicable.







	Subordination of Subordinated Debt Securities






	        Our obligations pursuant to any subordinated debt securities will be unsecured and will be subordinate and junior in priority of payment to
	certain of our other indebtedness to the
	extent described in a prospectus supplement. The subordinated indenture does not limit the amount of senior indebtedness we may incur. It also does not limit us from issuing any other secured or
	unsecured debt.

	of the rights to which any prospectus supplement may relate. The particular terms of the rights to which any prospectus supplement may relate and the extent, if any, to which the general provisions
	may apply to the rights so offered will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. To the extent that any particular terms of the rights, rights agreement or rights certificates described

	consisting of a purchase contract and one or more of our other securities described in this prospectus or securities of third parties, including U.S. Treasury securities, securing the holder's
	obligations under the purchase contract. The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to holders or vice versa and the payments may be unsecured or pre-funded on some basis. The

	above will be deemed to have been superseded by that prospectus supplement. We encourage you to read the applicable purchase contract for additional information before you decide whether to purchase

	DESCRIPTION OF UNITS






	        The following description, together with the additional information that we include in any applicable prospectus supplements, summarizes the
	material terms and provisions of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any units that we may offer under this prospectus,
	we will describe the particular terms of any series of units in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The terms of any units offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the
	terms described below.




	        We
	will incorporate by reference from reports that we file with the SEC, the form of unit agreement that describes the terms of the series of units we are offering, and any supplemental
	agreements, before the issuance of the related series of units. The following summaries of material terms and provisions of the units are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to,
	all the provisions of the unit agreement and any supplemental agreements applicable to a particular series of units. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplements related to the particular
	series of units that we may offer under this prospectus, as well as any related free writing prospectuses and the complete unit agreement and any supplemental agreements that contain the terms of the
	units.







	General






	        We may issue units consisting of common stock, preferred stock, one or more debt securities, warrants, rights or purchase contacts for the
	purchase of common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities in one or more series, in any combination. Each unit will be issued so that the holder of the unit is also the holder of each security
	included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each security included in the unit. The unit agreement under which a unit is issued may provide
	that the securities included in the unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time or at any time before a specified date.




	        We
	will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement the terms of the series of units being offered, including:






	




	the designation and terms of the units and of the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those
	securities may be held or transferred separately;








	




	any provisions of the governing unit agreement that differ from those described below; and








	




	any provisions for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer or exchange of the units or of the securities comprising the units.






	        The
	provisions described in this section, as well as those set forth in any prospectus supplement or as described under "Description of Common Stock," "Description of Preferred Stock,"
	"Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Warrants," "Description of Rights" and "Description of Purchase Contracts" will apply to each unit, as applicable, and to any common stock, preferred
	stock, debt security, warrant, right or purchase contract included in each unit, as applicable.







	Unit Agent






	        The name and address of the unit agent for any units we offer will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Table of Contents








	Enforceability of Rights by Holders of Units






	        Each unit agent will act solely as our agent under the applicable unit agreement and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or
	trust with any holder of any unit. A single bank or trust company may act as unit agent for more than one series of units. A unit agent will have no duty or responsibility in case of any default by us
	under the applicable unit agreement or unit, including any duty or responsibility to initiate any proceedings at law or otherwise, or to make any demand upon us. Any holder of a unit may, without the
	consent of the related unit agent or the holder of any other unit, enforce by appropriate legal action its rights as holder under any security included in the unit.

	CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF DELAWARE LAW AND OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS








	Anti-Takeover Provisions





	        The provisions of Delaware law, our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
	discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company.







	Delaware Law






	        Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prevents some Delaware corporations from engaging, under some circumstances, in a
	business combination, which includes a merger or sale of at least 10% of the corporation's assets with any interested stockholder, meaning a stockholder who, together with affiliates and associates,
	owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock,
	unless:






	




	the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder;








	




	upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
	least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or








	




	at or subsequent to such time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder the business combination is approved by the board of
	directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.






	        If
	Section 203 applied to us, the restrictions could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, could discourage attempts to
	acquire us.







	Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaw Provisions






	        Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile
	takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management team, including the following:






	






	Board of Directors
	Vacancies.




	  Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships. In
	addition, the number of directors constituting the full board of directors shall not be changed without the affirmative vote of the board of directors. These provisions hinder a stockholder from
	increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.








	






	Classified Board.




	  Our restated
	certificate of incorporation and proposed restated bylaws provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors. The existence of a classified board could delay a
	successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror. Pursuant to Delaware law, the directors of a
	corporation having a classified board may be removed by the stockholders only for cause, and pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation, by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and
	two thirds percent (66

	2

	/

	3

	%) of the votes that all stockholders would be entitled to cast in an election of directors. In addition, stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their
	votes for the election of directors.

	Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of
	Stockholders.




	  Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take
	action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of our
	board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer, or upon the request of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock.








	






	Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director
	Nominations.




	  Our restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of
	stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Our restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a
	stockholder's notice. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of
	stockholders.








	






	Issuance of Undesignated Preferred
	Stock.




	  Under our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to
	issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by the board of directors. The existence of authorized
	but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
	otherwise.








	






	Exclusive Forum.




	  Our restated
	certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum
	for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other
	employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; and (iv) any action
	asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors particularly
	experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation.
	However, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies' certificates of
	incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions
	contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.








	Limitation of Liability and Indemnification





	        As permitted by Delaware law, we have adopted provisions in our certificate of incorporation that limit or eliminate the personal liability of
	our directors. Our restated certificate of
	incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary
	damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:






	




	any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;








	




	any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;






	28











	Table of Contents







	




	any unlawful payments related to dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other distributions; or








	




	any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.






	        These
	limitations do not apply to liabilities arising under federal securities laws and do not affect the availability of equitable remedies, including injunctive relief or rescission.
	If Delaware law is amended to authorize the further elimination or limiting of a director, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
	law as so amended.




	        As
	permitted by Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation also provides that:






	




	we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law;








	




	we may indemnify our other employees and other agents to the same extent that we indemnify our officers and directors, unless otherwise
	determined by our board of directors; and








	




	we will advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with legal proceedings in connection with a legal proceeding to the
	fullest extent permitted by law.






	        The
	indemnification provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation are not exclusive. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors
	and executive officers. Each of these indemnification agreements provides, among other things, that we will indemnify such director or executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by law for
	claims arising in his or her capacity as a director or officer, as applicable, provided that he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
	to, our best interests and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Each of these indemnification agreements provide that in
	the event that we do not assume the defense of a claim against a director or officer, as applicable, we will be required to advance his or her expenses in connection with his or her defense, provided
	that he or she undertakes to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by us.




	        We
	believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under
	the Securities Act of 1933, which we refer to as the Securities Act, may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we understand that
	in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.




	        In
	addition, we maintain standard policies of insurance under which coverage is provided to our directors and officers against losses arising from claims made by reason of breach of duty
	or other wrongful act, and to us with respect to payments which may be made by us to such directors and officers pursuant to the above indemnification provisions or otherwise as a matter of law.




	        The
	foregoing discussion of our restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws, indemnification agreements and Delaware law is not intended to be exhaustive and is qualified in
	its entirety by such restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws, indemnification agreements or law.




	        Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
	otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
