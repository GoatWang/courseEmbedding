February 24, 2012 03:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EVERTEC, Inc. (“EVERTEC” or “the Company”), a diversified processing 
      business, today announced changes in the Company’s leadership as it 
      finalizes its transition to a stand-alone company and positions itself 
      for its next phase of growth.
    


      Félix M. Villamil has been elevated to Vice Chairman of EVERTEC’s Board 
      of Directors and has passed on day-to-day leadership duties to a new 
      Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Peter Harrington. Peter previously served 
      as President of Latin America and Canada for First Data Corporation, a 
      leading global technology and payments processing company. He has 
      extensive experience managing and growing payment processing businesses 
      in Latin America, as well as North America, Asia and Europe.
    

      EVERTEC also announced the promotion of Miguel Vizcarrondo from Senior

      EVERTEC in 2010 from Banco Popular. Miguel has significant experience 
      leading and growing the merchant acquiring business and other businesses 
      both at EVERTEC and Banco Popular.
    

      “Félix oversaw the company’s growth from a division within Popular to an 
      independent, global player in the payments processing sector. He led us 
      through EVERTEC’s transition to a stand-alone company and oversaw 
      exceptional growth,” said Marc Becker, EVERTEC’s Board Chairman. “We are 
      now poised to bring the company to the next level, and we believe that 
      Peter has the experience and global perspective to make this happen.” He 
      continued, “We are also very pleased about having Miguel take on this 
      new role. We have a superb executive team in place and are excited about 
      the future.”
    

      Félix M. Villamil stated, “I have a great deal of pride and satisfaction 
      following my tenure as CEO of EVERTEC. I look forward to continuing to 
      contribute to the growth of EVERTEC and working with Peter in my new 
      role as Vice Chairman.”
    

      Richard L. Carrión, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Popular and 
      Director on EVERTEC’s Board added, “I welcome Peter and have a great 
      deal of confidence in his ability to lead EVERTEC forward and to 
      continue building EVERTEC into the preeminent processing company in the 
      Latin American region. We sincerely thank Felix for everything that he 
      accomplished during his time as CEO, and we are grateful that we will 
      continue to benefit from Felix’s experience and knowledge on EVERTEC’s 
      Board.”
    

      “It is a privilege and honor to join such a great company and such a 
      strong team,” said Peter Harrington. “I know that an exciting future 
      awaits us as we harness the momentum within this great company to 
      further enhance our operations, expand our customer base and grow in 
      both existing and new markets.”
