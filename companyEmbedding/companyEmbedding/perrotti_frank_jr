You always said to me, “don’t worry angel love makes time pass & time makes love pass, you’ll be fine when I’m gone”. 
All the people who loved you time cannot make that pass away.
May your family and friends find peace in the deep love, sympathy and incredible loyalty that people had for you!
You will be missed and continued to be loved by so many Frankie!
Love always, me xoxo

Babe (as you were always called), I really don’t know what to say other than I loved you not only as a boss, but a very good friend and you were like a father to me.  I so much enjoyed working for you for 25 years and I will never, ever forget you.  May you rest in peace and know that you were loved by all who came in contact with you.  I will love you always and forever.  Your dedicated angel, honey, sweetheart, etc., whatever you wanted to call me.  R.I.P. my loving boss.

So many memories for decades that involved the Perrotti family and mutual friends from high school sports and trips to just hanging out and telling stories.  Very sorry for the loss to your entire family. We are thinking of you.
