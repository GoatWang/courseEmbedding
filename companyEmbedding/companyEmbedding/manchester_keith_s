Synopsis 
Manchester has many 'forgotten' underground spaces - canal tunnels, mines, caverns and mysterious route stretching beyond the city. This book provides details of a 'lost' river, a water wheel, about the secretive 'Guardian' bunker and of walks beneath the city's famous streets.

Clearly there are large elements with an excess of information that has had to be condensed so we don't loose interest and there are lots of tantalising gems that deserve to be investigated further providing it is safe to do so. I have joined guides in other Cities and would like to see an underground tour in Manchester - perhaps starting from the Cathedral Arches. Hopefully there will be a second volume and the twin Cities of Salford and Manchester can be brought closer.The presentation of the major elements is clear and the scrapbook of tantalising glimses for other items begs for more. Local explorers can start in Castlefield, visit the Science Museum Exhibits for Water and Sewerage then follow the Rochdale Canal around GMex. Those of us that recall the Subway under Deansgate between the Kendals buildings will find a few answers here.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsIntriguingBythe_rubikon 2 March 2011Format: PaperbackThis is an amazing book.  I live in Manchester and I had seen quite a lot about what lies beneath in the local press and the internet.  Manchester lies on sandstone and has been tunnelled and burrowed away underground for many a year.  I found the book Intriguing.  There are lots of pictures to keep you interested.  I understand there is now an underground manchester tour on which you can walk the route of the old canal under the GMEX and Great Northern Building.  I'm told what where the air raid shelters under Great Northern are remarkably untouched.  Left as they were at the time of WWII.Read more0Comment|
