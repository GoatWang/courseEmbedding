    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Turtle Beach Corporation is an American sound card and headset manufacturer. In 1995, the company merged with Voyetra, a company that made custom software for sound cards, to form Voyetra Turtle Beach, then headquartered in Valhalla, New York. In 2014, Voyetra Turtle Beach merged with Parametric Sound, retaining the Parametic Sound name until the name was changed to Turtle Beach Corporation.

History[edit]
Turtle Beach [1] was founded in 1985[2] as "Turtle Beach Softworks" by co-founders Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called "Vision", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company.
Over the following years, the company developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products. They retooled their product into "SampleVision", which initially supported the Akai S900, but was designed with an extensible framework, allowing other samplers to be supported. The SampleVision series was among the first to offer a Macintosh-like user experience on the PC (which at that time did not have Microsoft Windows to provide its GUI).
In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the "56K digital recording system" and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.
In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called "MultiSound." The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards.[3]
Turtle Beach was then acquired by Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS), a maker of clock chips for the PC market. ICS wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals, deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew.
With the addition of ICS's resources, Turtle Beach offered a full line of PC peripherals, releasing 8 new products within the 18 months following the sale. The MultiSound Monterey, The Tahiti, Maui, Audio Advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line, with products at every price point. On the software side, the company released "Wave for Windows", a sound editing program that was ahead of its time, but also ahead of the hardware curve; "Quad", the first multitrack recording application for the PC; and several other software titles.
As often occurs with corporate acquisitions, the original founders were soon no longer with the company. Martin Goldberg and Prabhat Jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to San Jose, ICS sold Turtle Beach to Voyetra Technologies, Inc. in 1996.




Voyetra's Midi Orchestrator Plus Software bundled with Sound Blaster Cards from Creative


Voyetra, founded by synthesizer pioneer Carmine Bonanno in 1975, had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. The purchase of Turtle Beach allowed Voyetra to leverage its close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. After the purchase, the company changed its name to Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. and sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. Turtle Beach also acquired Value Media's distribution channels founded by Prabhat Jain in 1995. This enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger USA distribution channels.
In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed [AudioTron], one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.
Recently, Turtle Beach has diversified its product line to include USB audio devices, video capture products and a wide variety of headphones, including the Ear Force line of multi-channel PC and gaming headphones.
Headsets[edit]
Turtle Beach has an extensive line of headsets, their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3. They also sell headsets compatible with PC/Mac and mobile platforms and Nintendo consoles.

A Catalina brand card


Sound cards[edit]
ISA bus[edit]
Multisound family, Hurricane architecture:

Multisound Classic – was a 430 USD full-length ISA sound card produced from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

History[edit]
Turtle Beach [1] was founded in 1985[2] as "Turtle Beach Softworks" by co-founders Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called "Vision", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company.
Over the following years, the company developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products. They retooled their product into "SampleVision", which initially supported the Akai S900, but was designed with an extensible framework, allowing other samplers to be supported. The SampleVision series was among the first to offer a Macintosh-like user experience on the PC (which at that time did not have Microsoft Windows to provide its GUI).
In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the "56K digital recording system" and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.
In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called "MultiSound." The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards.[3]
Turtle Beach was then acquired by Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS), a maker of clock chips for the PC market. ICS wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals, deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew.
With the addition of ICS's resources, Turtle Beach offered a full line of PC peripherals, releasing 8 new products within the 18 months following the sale. The MultiSound Monterey, The Tahiti, Maui, Audio Advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line, with products at every price point. On the software side, the company released "Wave for Windows", a sound editing program that was ahead of its time, but also ahead of the hardware curve; "Quad", the first multitrack recording application for the PC; and several other software titles.
As often occurs with corporate acquisitions, the original founders were soon no longer with the company. Martin Goldberg and Prabhat Jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to San Jose, ICS sold Turtle Beach to Voyetra Technologies, Inc. in 1996.




Voyetra's Midi Orchestrator Plus Software bundled with Sound Blaster Cards from Creative


Voyetra, founded by synthesizer pioneer Carmine Bonanno in 1975, had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. The purchase of Turtle Beach allowed Voyetra to leverage its close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. After the purchase, the company changed its name to Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. and sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. Turtle Beach also acquired Value Media's distribution channels founded by Prabhat Jain in 1995. This enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger USA distribution channels.
In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed [AudioTron], one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.
Recently, Turtle Beach has diversified its product line to include USB audio devices, video capture products and a wide variety of headphones, including the Ear Force line of multi-channel PC and gaming headphones.
Headsets[edit]
Turtle Beach has an extensive line of headsets, their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3. They also sell headsets compatible with PC/Mac and mobile platforms and Nintendo consoles.

A Catalina brand card


Sound cards[edit]
ISA bus[edit]
Multisound family, Hurricane architecture:

Multisound Classic – was a 430 USD full-length ISA sound card produced from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

History[edit]
Turtle Beach [1] was founded in 1985[2] as "Turtle Beach Softworks" by co-founders Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called "Vision", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company.
Over the following years, the company developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products. They retooled their product into "SampleVision", which initially supported the Akai S900, but was designed with an extensible framework, allowing other samplers to be supported. The SampleVision series was among the first to offer a Macintosh-like user experience on the PC (which at that time did not have Microsoft Windows to provide its GUI).
In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the "56K digital recording system" and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.
In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called "MultiSound." The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards.[3]
Turtle Beach was then acquired by Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS), a maker of clock chips for the PC market. ICS wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals, deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew.
With the addition of ICS's resources, Turtle Beach offered a full line of PC peripherals, releasing 8 new products within the 18 months following the sale. The MultiSound Monterey, The Tahiti, Maui, Audio Advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line, with products at every price point. On the software side, the company released "Wave for Windows", a sound editing program that was ahead of its time, but also ahead of the hardware curve; "Quad", the first multitrack recording application for the PC; and several other software titles.
As often occurs with corporate acquisitions, the original founders were soon no longer with the company. Martin Goldberg and Prabhat Jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to San Jose, ICS sold Turtle Beach to Voyetra Technologies, Inc. in 1996.




Voyetra's Midi Orchestrator Plus Software bundled with Sound Blaster Cards from Creative


Voyetra, founded by synthesizer pioneer Carmine Bonanno in 1975, had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. The purchase of Turtle Beach allowed Voyetra to leverage its close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. After the purchase, the company changed its name to Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. and sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. Turtle Beach also acquired Value Media's distribution channels founded by Prabhat Jain in 1995. This enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger USA distribution channels.
In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed [AudioTron], one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.
Recently, Turtle Beach has diversified its product line to include USB audio devices, video capture products and a wide variety of headphones, including the Ear Force line of multi-channel PC and gaming headphones.
Headsets[edit]
Turtle Beach has an extensive line of headsets, their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3. They also sell headsets compatible with PC/Mac and mobile platforms and Nintendo consoles.

A Catalina brand card


Sound cards[edit]
ISA bus[edit]
Multisound family, Hurricane architecture:

Multisound Classic – was a 430 USD full-length ISA sound card produced from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

History[edit]
Turtle Beach [1] was founded in 1985[2] as "Turtle Beach Softworks" by co-founders Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called "Vision", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company.
Over the following years, the company developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products. They retooled their product into "SampleVision", which initially supported the Akai S900, but was designed with an extensible framework, allowing other samplers to be supported. The SampleVision series was among the first to offer a Macintosh-like user experience on the PC (which at that time did not have Microsoft Windows to provide its GUI).
In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the "56K digital recording system" and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.
In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called "MultiSound." The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards.[3]
Turtle Beach was then acquired by Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS), a maker of clock chips for the PC market. ICS wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals, deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew.
With the addition of ICS's resources, Turtle Beach offered a full line of PC peripherals, releasing 8 new products within the 18 months following the sale. The MultiSound Monterey, The Tahiti, Maui, Audio Advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line, with products at every price point. On the software side, the company released "Wave for Windows", a sound editing program that was ahead of its time, but also ahead of the hardware curve; "Quad", the first multitrack recording application for the PC; and several other software titles.
As often occurs with corporate acquisitions, the original founders were soon no longer with the company. Martin Goldberg and Prabhat Jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to San Jose, ICS sold Turtle Beach to Voyetra Technologies, Inc. in 1996.




Voyetra's Midi Orchestrator Plus Software bundled with Sound Blaster Cards from Creative


Voyetra, founded by synthesizer pioneer Carmine Bonanno in 1975, had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. The purchase of Turtle Beach allowed Voyetra to leverage its close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. After the purchase, the company changed its name to Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. and sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. Turtle Beach also acquired Value Media's distribution channels founded by Prabhat Jain in 1995. This enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger USA distribution channels.
In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed [AudioTron], one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.
Recently, Turtle Beach has diversified its product line to include USB audio devices, video capture products and a wide variety of headphones, including the Ear Force line of multi-channel PC and gaming headphones.
Headsets[edit]
Turtle Beach has an extensive line of headsets, their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3. They also sell headsets compatible with PC/Mac and mobile platforms and Nintendo consoles.

A Catalina brand card


Sound cards[edit]
ISA bus[edit]
Multisound family, Hurricane architecture:

Multisound Classic – was a 430 USD full-length ISA sound card produced from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

History[edit]
Turtle Beach [1] was founded in 1985[2] as "Turtle Beach Softworks" by co-founders Roy Smith and Robert Hoke. The company's first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough Ensoniq Mirage sampling keyboard. The Mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs, pianos, horns, and other instruments in their performances. The software, called "Vision", connected the Mirage to a PC and used the PC's screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier. Ensoniq decided to resell Vision through their dealer network and Turtle Beach Softworks became a profitable company.
Over the following years, the company developed a few other programs that supported Ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products. They retooled their product into "SampleVision", which initially supported the Akai S900, but was designed with an extensible framework, allowing other samplers to be supported. The SampleVision series was among the first to offer a Macintosh-like user experience on the PC (which at that time did not have Microsoft Windows to provide its GUI).
In 1988, Turtle Beach began to work on developing its first hardware product, a hard disk based audio editing system. Among the first of its kind, the product was named the "56K digital recording system" and was released in 1990. Its card, 56K-PC, was based on a Motorola 56000 DSP chip, and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files. The 56K system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded.
In 1990, Turtle Beach began developing its second PC sound card. This card used high quality A/D and D/A, a high quality synthesizer from eMu, and an onboard DSP chip. This product was called "MultiSound." The MultiSound product competed with more established products of the day from Advanced Gravis (now defunct), Ad Lib, Inc. (now defunct), Creative Labs, and Media Vision. CCRMA's Music Kit and DSP Tools running on Motorola 56001 DSP, initially developed for NeXTcube system, was later ported on NeXTSTEP with Turtle Beach Fiji/Pinnacle DSP cards.[3]
Turtle Beach was then acquired by Integrated Circuit Systems (ICS), a maker of clock chips for the PC market. ICS wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals, deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew.
With the addition of ICS's resources, Turtle Beach offered a full line of PC peripherals, releasing 8 new products within the 18 months following the sale. The MultiSound Monterey, The Tahiti, Maui, Audio Advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line, with products at every price point. On the software side, the company released "Wave for Windows", a sound editing program that was ahead of its time, but also ahead of the hardware curve; "Quad", the first multitrack recording application for the PC; and several other software titles.
As often occurs with corporate acquisitions, the original founders were soon no longer with the company. Martin Goldberg and Prabhat Jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to San Jose, ICS sold Turtle Beach to Voyetra Technologies, Inc. in 1996.




Voyetra's Midi Orchestrator Plus Software bundled with Sound Blaster Cards from Creative


Voyetra, founded by synthesizer pioneer Carmine Bonanno in 1975, had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early 1990s. The purchase of Turtle Beach allowed Voyetra to leverage its close ties with PC manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with Voyetra software and drivers. After the purchase, the company changed its name to Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. and sold millions of sound cards to Dell Computer under the Turtle Beach brand. Turtle Beach also acquired Value Media's distribution channels founded by Prabhat Jain in 1995. This enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger USA distribution channels.
In 2001, Voyetra Turtle Beach developed [AudioTron], one of the first standalone Internet audio receivers. The device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release, but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products. Turtle Beach opted out of the network audio market in 2004.
Recently, Turtle Beach has diversified its product line to include USB audio devices, video capture products and a wide variety of headphones, including the Ear Force line of multi-channel PC and gaming headphones.
Headsets[edit]
Turtle Beach has an extensive line of headsets, their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3. They also sell headsets compatible with PC/Mac and mobile platforms and Nintendo consoles.

A Catalina brand card


Sound cards[edit]
ISA bus[edit]
Multisound family, Hurricane architecture:

Multisound Classic – was a 430 USD full-length ISA sound card produced from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially and can be used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here
Multisound Tahiti – Multisound Classic derivative without the on-card synthesis. Motorola 56001 chipset.
Multisound Monterey – Multisound Monterey was the first cost-reduced version of the MultiSound. In essence the synthesizer (the Emu Proteus) was replaced by the less expensive Rio card that was based on the ICS WaveFront chipset. The DSP and A/D was identical to the MultiSound, as the Monterey was a simple combination of the Rio mounted onto the Tahiti.

Multisound family, 2nd generation architecture:

Multisound Fiji – last real professional ISA cards from Multisound line. Motorola 56002 chipset, Audiophile quality 20-bit DAC/ADC, >97 dB Signal to Noise Ratio, DSP-based Hurricane Architecture, Optional Digital S/PDIF I/O (with daughterboard), MPU-401 compatible, WaveBlaster compatible header, Enhanced Full Duplex, Windows 95 Plug'n'Play compatible. Compatible with Windows 95, 98, 98se and Me in Plug'n'Play mode ; NT4, 2000 and XP (using the last NT4 non-Plug'n'Play driver and settings).
Multisound Pinnacle – same as Multisound Fiji but with additional specifications : full-length ISA card, hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM – using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.

Other:

Malibu Surround 64 – 4MB 64-Voice ISA bus sample-based soundcard introduced 1997. Uses Kurzweil hardware synthesis. 64 voices including 32 hardware voices and 32 software voices, 4MB instrument samples compressed to 2MB ROM. Crystal CS4237B PnP chipset.
Maui – Maui was an inexpensive sample-based synthesizer add-on card. It used the ICS WaveFront synthesizer chip (as did the Monterey and the Rio) and offered optional RAM slots that would allow users to add up to 8 megabytes of their own .WAV format samples (up to 16-bit 44.1 kHz). This process, called SampleStore, pre-dated the Creative/Microsoft "SoundFonts" concept by two years. This card was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. Because of SampleStore and WavePatch, a professional-grade sound programmer for all WaveFront-equipped cards, many music enthusiasts used the Maui as a cheap yet high-quality studio sampler.
Monte Carlo – Monte Carlo was the first Turtle Beach sound card that was not designed in-house. It was based on a Crystal semiconductor reference design for a "Sound Blaster Compatible" card.
Tropez Classic – non PnP ISA card from same era as original SoundBlaster AWE32 and Gravis Ultrasound MAX. ICS Wavefront sample-based chipset, OPTi 929, CS4231, 2MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for max 12MB sample RAM.
Tropez Plus – PnP version of Tropez Classic. CS4232, ICS Wavefront, 4MB ROM, 3 SIMM slots for RAM.
Tropez 32 / TBS-2000 – cost reduced versions of Tropez+ without SIMM slots. Only 1MB or 2MB sample ROM.
TBS-929, TBS-930, TBS-931 – OEM low-cost cards for CD-ROM upgrade kits all uses OPTi chipset. TBS-931 uses OPTi 82C931, older are similar as Monte Carlo line.

Wavetable Daughter Board[edit]

Rio – The RIO was a 'wavetable' daughtercard MIDI synthesizer (sample-based synthesizer) that was compatible with the Sound Blaster daughtercard pinout. This product was intended for Sound Blaster owners who wanted to improve their MIDI playback by adding sample-based synthesis. The RIO offered one RAM slot that would allow users to add their own sounds, and was compatible with the WavePatch sound programmer. Unlike the Maui, however, the Rio used a SIPP slot for its expansion memory; compatible RAM was rather difficult and considerably more expensive to obtain.
Cancun FX – sample-based upgrade board for waveblaster connector

PCMCI bus[edit]

Audio Advantage PCMCIA – old soundcard for notebooks, Hurricane architecture

PCI bus[edit]




Montego A3DXstream



Catalina – 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Based on VIA Envy24HT-S audio chipset.
Daytona PCI – early PCI card introduced November 1997, S3 Sonic Vibes 86C617 Chipset, Downloadable Sounds (DLS), hardware sample-based synthesis, SRS 3D Audio Enhancement

Part Number : TBS-0660-01V

Montego DDL – Dolby Digital Live-capable. 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, EAX 2.0 with on board sound processing. Priced around $80 USD. See also: Montego DDL Control Panel
Montego A3DXstream – based on the Aureal AU8820 (Vortex) chipset, unrelated to the current Montego DDL in every way but the name.
Montego II Quadzilla – the Montego II was a family of cards that replaced the original Montego card. The card was based on the Aureal AU8830 (Vortex 2) chipset but differed from the reference Aureal design. The Quadzilla was the 4-channel version and achieved this via a separate daughtercard, whereas the other AU8830 cards such as Aureal Vortex SQ2500 and Diamond Monster Sound MX300 used a single card.
Montego II Home Studio - included a more advanced S/PDIF I/O daughterboard than the Quadzilla as well as a Turtle Beach CancunFX MIDI daughterboard.
Riviera – affordable Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound without on-board sound processing. Based on C-Media CMI8738 audio controller chipset.
Santa Cruz – Based on the Cirrus Logic SoundFusion (aka Crystal 4630) DSP. It featured four analog channel outputs, a line input and microphone input are included on the back panel. Also included is a connector TB dubbed the "VersaJack." The VersaJack has multiple functions selectable by software including digital SPDIF output, a second analog input, analog output or 5th and 6th speaker outputs. This card also supported an open source software based EAX. Dell Computer offered this card as an audio upgrade for some of its computers.

USB bus[edit]

Audio Advantage – Popular line of USB sound cards, all of which have digital S/PDIF outputs. It comes in three models: Micro, Amigo, and Roadie.

Headsets[edit]
EAR Force – Line of gaming headsets for most gaming platform such as; PC, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii. Models available range from wired stereo headsets for PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii, to wireless models with Dolby Digital decoding for Xbox 360 and PS3. Features include Chat Boost (boosts chat level if soundtrack gets loud), mic monitoring, etc. All current models are as followed (Xbox 360) X41, DX11, X31, PX21, X11, X12, XLC, PX5, (PS3/PS4 compatible) X41/PBT, DPX21, PX21, P11, DP11 PBT, PX5, (Wii) W3, D2, (PC) HPA2, Z2, and Z1
Software[edit]
56K – The 56K Digital Recording System was the first of the Turtle Beach audio systems for the IBM PC platform. It made use of the Motorola 56000 Digital Signal Processor for accelerating digital audio data transfers through the IBM PC's ISA bus. The 56K was designed to be connected to the AES-EBU or S/PDIF jacks on a professional DAT recorder. With the included SoundStage graphical audio editing software, a 56K system installed in a 286, 386 or 486 Intel PC running Windows 3.0 or 3.1 can be used as a complete post-production digital audio editing solution. The 56K system consisted of three major components:

The 56K-PC Digital Signal Processor Card (a 16-bit digital audio processor on a full-length ISA board).
The 56K-D Digital Interface Box, which allows your DAT machine to talk to the computer via AES/EBU or S/PDIF-compatible digital formats.
The SoundStage digital audio editing software.

Quad – 4-track recording software for PC meant to somewhat mimic a 4-track cassette recorder.[4]

            Bringing you the best deals from 
            the stores that you know and love
        



What is Stuccu?

                Stuccu is a website that works together with different sellers so you can buy products at low prices. 
                Our vision is to make Stuccu your first and only stop when it comes to online shopping. 
            

                And if we can make it fun for you, all the better.
            






                    What can we do for you?
                

                    We will search the web and bring you the best offers
                    from major online retailers.
                









                *
            
                Using Stuccu will save you both money and time as you no
                longer need to search through dozens of websites.
                Instead, everything is in one place: Stuccu.

                We will then direct you to the product pages on the sellers' websites where you can finalize the purchase.
