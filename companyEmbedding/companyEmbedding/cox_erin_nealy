DBJ: What was your first job (as a teen or in college, etc.)?
Nealy Cox: Lifeguard — those were the days.
DBJ: Why did you decide to go into your line of work?
Nealy Cox: Although an entrepreneurial path, going into digital forensics in the private sector seemed like a natural progression for my career. I already had several years of experience investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes for the Justice Department. I was attracted to Stroz Friedberg because it is run by former federal prosecutors and investigators like me, and enjoys a reputation for objective neutrality and integrity within the industry. When I decided to leave public service, I wanted a new challenge and I was excited to have the opportunity to open and lead Stroz Friedberg’s Dallas office and computer forensics lab. Even though I’m more of a businesswoman now, I still use my lawyering skills every day, as well as my knowledge of computers and data security to help businesses solve some of their biggest problems.
DBJ: What do you enjoy most about your job/career?
Nealy Cox: People come to us with problems. They’ve experienced a problem with their digital assets and they’re at the point where they need help, many times fast. At the end of the day, I enjoy helping clients, answering the who, what, when, where, why and how using the best evidence they have, which is usually digital evidence. I enjoy the challenge developing business, and also providing objective guidance to companies and assisting them with strategic decisions.
DBJ: What do you like the least about your job/career?
Nealy Cox: Cyber criminals don’t keep regular office hours. Data breaches can disable a company at any time. We respond whenever and wherever we’re needed, and we work until the problem is resolved. The reactive nature of my job can wreak havoc on the personal/professional life. At the same time, it’s very gratifying when you are able to get it right. My life is filled with many wonderful challenges, so I always try and view it as a blessing, not a burden.

DBJ: What do you think has been the key to your success?
Nealy Cox: A combination of things — trusting my instincts about right and wrong; being a quick study, and working hard. I have never considered myself one of those people who things come easily for — I’m more of a hard work and determination sort of gal.
DBJ: What’s the greatest challenge you’ve had to face, and how did you overcome it?
Nealy Cox: I joined the U.S. Attorney’s office as a young, female attorney from a civil law firm. Most of my colleagues were older, male, and had a great deal of trial experience across the board. I had to earn their respect and prove that I was worthy to be among them. That’s a tough challenge given the caliber of the attorneys at the U.S. Attorney’s office but it was a challenge that made me a much better lawyer.
DBJ: Of what professional achievement are you most proud, and why?
Nealy Cox: I am proud to have taken the non-traditional path in my career — always looking for new challenges and leadership opportunities.
DBJ: What is your business motto?




 


Nealy Cox: The best way to predict the future is to create it.
DBJ: What are you known for by your peers?
Nealy Cox: Honesty, integrity, high standards (some would say too high), silliness, and my love of all things shoes and bags!
DBJ: Tell us about a North Texas business leader you admire, and why.
Nealy Cox: Getting back to my love of shoes, I admire the way Stanley Marcus built a brand — personally, as well as for his stores and by extension the city of Dallas — that was synonymous with style, class and quality. He is an example of how a business leader can have an enormous effect on a city through civic involvement and active corporate leadership.
DBJ: What is your greatest achievement outside of work?
Nealy Cox: My greatest achievement (perhaps better to say aspiration and challenge) is working on a daily basis with my husband, Trey Cox (who is a successful and busy Dallas lawyer) to create a happy and nurturing environment for our two girls — one where they see the world as limitless in terms of possibility and grow up knowing they can do and be anything in their life. Our motto for them is anything is within their grasp with hard work and determination.
DBJ: How would you rate Dallas-Fort Worth as a market for young executives/entrepreneurs?
Nealy Cox: Dallas-Fort Worth is diverse and cosmopolitan — more so than other cities in the Southwest. North Texas is an area where doors open for people with good ideas who are willing to work hard.
DBJ: What is your ultimate career goal?
Nealy Cox: To seek out challenging leadership opportunities. My goal is to have a satisfying, fulfilling career, one that I can balance successfully with my personal and family priorities.
DBJ: What piece of advice did you receive early on that still rings true?
Nealy Cox: “Always try your best to do good,” that’s what Judge Henry Politz used to always tell me. He was Chief Judge of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals when I worked for him as a law clerk, fresh out of law school. After our year working together, I often called him for advice and mentoring. He would start every conversation with “what good have you done today?” I try to take that with me wherever I go.
DBJ: What is your most significant community service leadership role in which you serve?
Nealy Cox: I tend to focus on charities that either help children or assist low-income women raising children on their own. I’m involved with Children’s Hospital, the Dallas County Child Advocacy Center, the YWCA and Hope Cottage.
DBJ: And, just for fun, if you were a superhero, which one would you be, and why?
Nealy Cox: Wonder Woman, for obvious reasons.
