Items Won and Joseph Joseph Product Review











I wanted to share these fabulous items with you that I was lucky enough to win from Joseph Joseph.


You may remember a post I'd done over at Dolly is Cooking three years ago about one of their Chopping Block Sets that I purchased.  I brought that review over to this website and you can read about it here.  The set I won is the Index Steel Set of 4 large colour-coded chopping boards with stainless-steel storage case located at Joseph Joseph here

My product review will give you some information about the product just in case you're interested in purchasing one. Look at this gorgeous one I won recently! It is very similar to the one I own. The tab coloring is one of the major differences.

My daughter, Catie recently got married so I gave the newest chopping block to her. It fits nicely in their new kitchen because it is compact. I asked her how she liked it and this is what she said, "I love that thing!  I use it everyday!"  I do believe she likes it. We use our Joseph Joseph chopping block almost daily around here as well.







We absolutely love the salad bowl!

Hands On Salad Bowl

























This bowl is so very handy.  It holds a lot of salad and when you are ready to toss and serve the hands are there for easy use.  The fit onto the bowl and can be stored that way when washed and dried.  I love the convenience.










Hands On Salad Bowl not in stock now

I don't know if they will restock it but if you find one, I suggest you buy it!

Love it!














Turner Tongs located at Joseph Joseph here



These are different because they are as stated turner tongs.  They make it easy to turn foods that otherwise might be a little tricky with regular tongs.

I haven't used them extensively yet, but can tell you I really like them!

They store easily in a drawer or utensil crock.









Milly Salt & Pepper Grinders 

(pictured in top photo)



I like the compact size

Milly Salt & Pepper Grinders located at Joseph Joseph here

I haven't had the chance to use these at all but you can read all about the excellent reviews

here









Catcher Citrus reamer with pip catcher located at Joseph Joseph here









This little reamer is quite handy!

I really like it!

I have a lot reamer/juicers but this one just may be my favorite!











Flavouriser 4-in-1 tenderising and flavouring tool located at Joseph Joseph here











4-in-1 Flavoring Tool

Textured side for tenderizing

Flat side for flattening

Pestle Top for grinding

Citrus reamer end for juicing





How handy is that? I can tell you very handy! It is heavy weight but that is a plus! I really like this item for sure!  The weight makes for quick time in tenderizing, flattening, juicing, grinding!  It is an excellent kitchen tool!



I'll let you in on a secret I also was using it to pop the head of my mixer back on tightly. I still have the KitchenAid and it has had quite a busy life, but Chuck with Carly's help found and bought a new KitchenAid Mixer for my birthday! I am having to get used to that powerful motor and the lift bowl but it also works quickly. So this tool is retired from bopping the mixer head back on. I have placed the old KitchenAid Mixer in the kitchen appliance retirement home, as for the 4 in 1 flavoring tool it is hard at work doing what it was meant to do and doing very well!





I've yet to find a Joseph Joseph product that I don't enjoy using and regularly too!



I RECOMMEND THESE HIGHLY!







Disclosure:  I won these products but was not asked to review.  I've done the product review on my own because from time to time if I really like a product I do review. The opinions are my own as usual.

I really like the salad bowl with the 'hands' in it.  What a neat concept.  Hope you have a good night.

Dr. Joseph Mercola Ordered 
  to Stop Illegal Claims 
Stephen Barrett, M.D. 

  Joseph Mercola, D.O., who practices in Schaumburg, Illinois, also operates one of the Internet's largest and most trafficked health information sites. Since 2012, Mercola has stated that his site has over 300,000 pages and is visited by "millions of people each day" and that his electronic newsletter has over one million subscribers [1].  The site vigorously promotes and sells dietary supplements, many of which bear his name.
For many years, Dr. Mercola and other staff members saw patients at his clinic, which was called the Optimal Wellness Center. In 1999, Mercola announced that  about one third of his new patients were autistic and that he had treated about 60 such children with secretin, a hormone he said "appeared to be a major breakthrough." [2] It is now well settled that secretin is ineffective against autism [3], but Mercola's Web site still says it works if a child complies with his recommended diet strategies [4].
In 2004, Medical Economics reported that Mercola's practice employed 50 people and that he employed 15 people to run his newsletter, including three editors [5]. Much of his support has come from chiropractors who promote his newsletter from their Web sites. Two of his books  hit the #2 sales rank on Amazon Books shortly  after his newsletter plugged them for the first time.  
In 2006, an article in Business Week concluded that he was "one of a fast-growing number of alternative-health practitioners who seek to capitalize on concerns about the conventional health care system—in his case relying on slick promotion, clever use of information, and scare tactics." The article described how his promotions included (a) promises of "free' to sell stuff; (a) lots of "bonuses," (c) reports of real news that link to marginally related products, and (d) exaggerated claims. [6] 
In 2012, an article in Chicago Magazine reported that Mercola had stopped practicing medicine  six years previously to focus on his Web site [7]. However, his decision may have been influenced by a 3-year battle with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation [8]. I did not see any mention of this on his Web site, and the site invited patients to come to his clinic—which was renamed Dr. Mercola's Natural Health Center—for detoxification, chiropractic, Dispensary, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Functional Medicine Program, homeopathy, Neuro-Structural Integration Technique (NST), nutritional consultation, Nutritional Typing Test, thermography, Total Body Modification (TBM), and Active Isolated Stretching.  
In September 2014, Mercola announced that he had closed the clinic "in order to devote his full time and attention to research, education and increasing public awareness." [9] 
Many of Mercola's articles make unsubstantiated claims and clash with those of leading medical and public health organizations. For example, he opposes immunization [10]  fluoridation. [11], mammography [12], and the routine administration of vitamin K shots to the newborn [13,14]; claims that amalgam fillings are toxic [15]; and makes many unsubstantiated recommendations for dietary supplements. Mercola's reach has been greatly boosted by repeated promotion on the "Dr. Oz Show."  
Mercola's Profits
Mercola is very critical of drug company profits and proudly states:

Mercola.com does NOT accept any third-party advertising or sponsorship, and I am in no way tied into any pharmaceutical company or any other corporate "interest" whatsoever. So you get the real inside scoop on health issues, with practical advice that matters to you untainted by outside influence! [1]

He also states:



Mercola.com is not . . . a tool to get me a bigger house and car, or to run for Senate. I fund this site, and therefore, am not handcuffed to any advertisers, silent partners or corporate parents. . . .
Profit generated from the sale of the products I recommend goes right back into maintaining and building a better site. A site that, startling as it may be with all the greed-motivated hype out there in health care land, is truly for you [16].

I don't doubt Mercola's sincerity—and I  know nothing about how he allocates his income. But the BlockShopper Chicago Web site states that in 2006 he purchased a house in South Barrington, Illinois, for $2 million and that it now has 5,563 square feet. 

      The Bing Maps aerial view indicates
      that the property is  quite luxurious. 
 


In 2011, Mercola announced the formation of Health Liberty, a nonprofit coalition whose goals include promoting organic foods and targeting fluoridation, vaccination, genetically modified foods, and the use of amalgam fillings [17]. In a video accompanying the announcement, Mercola stated that he planned to donate $1 million to catalyze the project. In addition to Mercola.com, the coalition members are:

National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), which understates the benefits and exaggerates the risks of vaccination. 
Fluoride Action Network (FAN), the leading promoter of misinformation about fluoridation. Its donations are funneled through the nonprofit American Environmental   Health Studies Project.
 Institute for Responsible Technology, which understates the benefits and exaggerates the risks of genetically modification of foods
Consumers for Dental Choice, which vigorously attacks amalgam use with misinformation, propaganda, lobbying, and lawsuits. 
Organic Consumers Association, which irresponsibly promotes unpasteurized milk and spreads false alarms about food irradiation, agricultural biotechnology, and vaccines.

The money for the donations was funneled from Mercola.com Health Resources LLC  through Mercola's nonprofit Natural Health Resources Foundation, which showed the following grants on its tax returns:

The "health freedom" argument involves deception by misdirection. It focuses on individual freedom but does not consider how people who fail to protect their health put the rest of society at physical and/or financial risk. Failing to vaccinate, for example, decreases herd immunity so that contagious diseases spread more widely. In 2012, Mercola began calling his newsletter "Health Liberty Newsletter."
In 2013, Williamette Week reported that Mercola had donated a total of $26,975 in cash and in-kind contributions that included polling and a YouTube video to support the efforts of the antifluoridation group that is opposing a fluoridation referendum in Portland, Oregon. The  report also stated that "Mercola has questioned whether HIV causes AIDS, suggests that many cancers can be cured by baking soda, and warns parents not to vaccinate their children. He also says that animals are psychic." [18]
Better Business Bureau Reports
Mercola markets his supplements through Mercola Health Resources, LLC. In 2011, after a customer complained that she thought a product she purchased was overpriced, I began checking whether the Better Business Bureau had received any complaints. I found that the company was rated C- on a scale of A+ through F.  On February 1, 2012, the BBB reported that during the previous 36 months, there were 26 complaints—which is not an unusually high number for a high-volume business—but the report contained the following comments:

A recent review of consumer complaints filed with the BBB of Chicago & Northern Illinois against your Mercola Health Resources, LLC delineates a pattern of consumer allegations. Consumers are alleging that Mercola Health Resources does not honor the 100% money-back guarantee listed on your website. Customers have reported that refunds have not been provided for returns that were specifically covered under this guarantee. Consumers have also reported that they have experienced delivery issues. While www.mercola.com states that orders ship within 10 business days, consumers say they have waited much longer for their products. Customers allege that the company's service staff has been unable to provide explanations regarding this delay. Some consumers have also reported that Mercola provided them with shipment tracking numbers that were not valid with their respective carriers [19].

On November 26, 2013, I checked again and found that during the previous 36 months there had been 34 complaints,  but  Mercola Health Resources was rated A+. In September 2015, I checked and found that there had been 10 complaints but the rating remained A+. In January 2017, I checked again and found there had been 5 complaints and the rating was A-.
FDA Warnings 
In 2005, the FDA ordered Mercola and his Optimal Wellness Center to  stop making illegal  claims for products sold through his Web site [20]. The claims to which the FDA objected involved three products:

Living Fuel Rx, claimed to offer an "exceptional countermeasure" against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc. 
Tropical Traditions Virgin Coconut Oil, claimed to reduce the risk of heart disease and has beneficial effects against Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and many infectious agents
Chlorella, claimed to fight cancer and normalize blood pressure.

In 2006, the FDA sent Mercola and his center a second warning that was based on product labels collected during an inspection at his facility and on claims made on the Optimum Wellness Center Web site [21]. This time the claims to which the FDA objected involve four products:

Vibrant Health Research Chlorella XP, claimed to "help to virtually eliminate your risk of developing cancer in the future." 
Fresh Shores Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, claimed to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and degenerative diseases.
Momentum Health Products Vitamin K2, possibly useful in treating certain kinds of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Momentum Health Products Cardio Essentials Nattokinase NSK-SD, claimed to be "a much safer and effective option than aspirin and other pharmaceutical agents to treating heart disease."

The warning letters explained that the use of such claims in the marketing of these products violates the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, which bans unapproved claims for products that are intended for curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing of diseases. (Intended use can be established through product labels, catalogs, brochures, tapes, Web sites, or other circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product.) 
In 2011, the FDA ordered Mercola to stop making  claims for thermography that go beyond what the equipment he uses (Medtherm2000 infrared camera) was cleared for. The warning letter said that statements on Mercola's site improperly  imply that the Meditherm camera can be used alone to diagnose or screen for various diseases or conditions associated with the breast, they also represent that the sensitivity of the Meditherm Med2000 Telethermographic camera is greater than that of machines used in mammography. The statements to which the FDA objected included:

"Revolutionary and Safe Diagnostic Tool Detects Hidden Inflammation: Thermography"

"The Newest Safe Cancer Screening Tool"

"[b]ecause measuring inflammation through thermal imaging is a proactive, preventative method you can use for detecting disease, which significantly improves your chances for longevity and good health."

Additionally, thermograms provide: "Reliable and accurate information for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. . ."
"Yes, it's true. Thermograms provide you with early diagnosis and treatment assistance in such problems as cancer, inflammatory processes, neurological and vascular dysfunction, and musculoskeletal injury."
Thermography can benefit patients by detecting conditions including: Arthritis: "[d]ifferentiate between osteoarthritis and more severe forms like rheumatoid." Immune Dysfunction, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue, "Digestive Disorders: Irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, and Crohn's disease . . ." and "Other Conditions:  including bursitis, herniated discs, ligament or muscle tear, lupus, nerve problems, whiplash, stroke screening, cancer and many, many others." [22] 

In 2011, the Chicago Tribune  reported that Mercola had not complied with the FDA's order and intended to "fight the FDA . . . if they decide to take it further." [23] However, in 2012, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation asked Mercola to attend an informal conference to discuss a complaint that he was "making deceptive claims promoting thermography as a standalone diagnostic tool for detecting cancer and other diseases and is attacking the use of mammograms." Mercola's Web site still promotes thermography and trashes mammography, but the site stopped offering thermography appointments later that year—and  Mercola's special report, "The Safe Breast Cancer Screening Test  Your Doctor Isn't Telling You About," is no longer apparent.
FTC Action
In 2016, Mercola, Mercola.com, LLC and Mercola.com Health Resources, settled a Federal Trade Commission complaint by agreeing to stop selling tanning beds and to pay to $5,334,067 to cover the cost of refunds and administration of the refund program. The defendants were charged with falsely claiming that their indoor tanning devices would enable consumers to slash their risk of cancer and improve the clarity, tone and texture of their skin,  giving them a more youthful appearance. Commenting on the case, Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, noted that indoor tanning is not safe because it increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma [24].
