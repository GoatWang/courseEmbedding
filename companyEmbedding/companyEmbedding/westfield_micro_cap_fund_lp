Small Cap Growth Equity
Inception Date: July 1, 1989
Strategy AUM: $2,012 million as of June 30, 2017
Status: Open to new investors
		
		
		
		
		 
	




Since 1989, Westfield’s Small Cap Growth Equity strategy has provided clients with exposure to a relatively concentrated portfolio of small cap companies with market capitalizations typically less than $1.5 billion at the time of initial purchase or within the range of its benchmark, the Russell 2000® Growth Index.  In constructing client portfolios, our team endeavors to identify 60 to 80 stocks which we believe provide our clients the best opportunities for growth while maintaining our disciplined valuation sensitivity.
The Small Cap Growth Equity strategy is offered as a separate account and through a sub-advised mutual fund vehicle.
