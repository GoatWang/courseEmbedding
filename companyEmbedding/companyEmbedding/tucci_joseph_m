 Joseph M. Tucci 1947— Biography



      Joseph M. Tucci
      
      1947–
    











        Chief executive officer and president, EMC Corporation
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1947, in Brooklyn, New York.
    

      Education: Manhattan College, BA, 1968; Columbia University, MBA, 1984.
    

      Family: Married Maureen (maiden name unknown).
    

      Career: RCA Corporation, 1970–1986, systems programmer, followed by
      several other positions; Unisys Corporation, 1986–1990, president
      of U.S. Information Systems; Wang Global, 1990–1993, executive vice
      president of operations; 1993–1999, chairman and CEO; Getronics,
      1999, deputy CEO; EMC Corporation, 2000, president; 2000–2001,
      president and COO; 2001–, CEO and president.
    

      Address: EMC Corporation, 176 South Street, Hopkinton, Massachusetts
      01748; http://www.emc.com.
    

      ■ Joseph M. Tucci became president of EMC Corporation in January
      2000 and a year later was also named chief executive officer. EMC was a
      leading provider of products, services, and solutions for information
      storage and management, most importantly including RAID (redundant array
      of independent disks) storage systems as well as a comprehensive number of
      NAS (network attached storage) file servers and a full line of software
      designed to manage, share, and protect data. EMC sold its products both
      directly and through distributors and manufacturers such as its largest
      partner, the personal-computer company Dell, which sold cobranded EMC
      systems.
    

      When Tucci joined EMC, after a decade of strong financial gains the
      company was no longer the uncontested market leader in information
      storage. Three factors—the economic downturn that began in 2000,
      the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and increased
      competition from IBM, Hitachi Data Systems, and others—proceeded to
      reverse the once-prosperous direction of EMC. Fortunately, Tucci was
      experienced at turning companies hit by financial hardships around; during
      his period of leadership at EMC, he proved that he could indeed weather
      any economic storm.

      BEGINNING HIS CAREER
    

      Tucci earned a bachelor's degree in marketing from Manhattan
      College, of Riverdale, New York, in 1968 and a master's in business
      administration from Columbia University in 1984. Tucci began his
      professional career in 1970 as a systems programmer at RCA Corporation.
      Later Tucci became president of U.S. Information Systems at Unisys
      Corporation, after the company was formed by a merger between Burroughs
      and Sperry in 1986.
    

      TURNING WANG AROUND
    

      In 1991 Tucci joined Wang Global, an information-technology services
      company, as an executive vice president of operations in charge of all
      marketing, sales, service, and support. He became chairman of the board
      and chief executive officer
       in December 1993 and remained at those positions until June 1999. Tucci
      directed the operational and financial reorganization of Wang Global over
      the six-year period beginning in 1993, during which the company went
      through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Tucci called Wang a "business
      execution failure," as the company had entered too many segments of
      the office computer market and failed to notice the industry shift from
      mainframe computers to local area networks connecting arrays of personal
      computers.
    

      Tucci began Wang's turnaround by identifying the company's
      past strengths: a large and loyal customer base, a global identity, a
      comprehensive range of services, superior service delivery, strategic
      alliances with industry leaders, and retention of key technical employees.
      He guided Wang through a costly but successful emergence from bankruptcy
      protection and, eventually, transformed the company from a manufacturer of
      midrange computers into a service provider of network- and
      desktop-technology services and solutions.
    

      Between 1995 and 1999, Tucci spearheaded acquisitions of 10 companies in
      order to complement Wang's existing service-provider capabilities,
      moves that increased the number of Wang employees to 20,000 and raised its
      annual revenues from under $1 billion in 1994 to $3.5 billion in 1999. At
      the end of this period, Tucci arranged a $2 billion acquisition of Wang by
      the Netherlands-based information-technology services company Getronics,
      where Tucci served as deputy CEO from June to December 1999. Tucci gained
      valuable leadership and management experience while directing the
      reorganization of Wang; the lessons he learned there proved useful when he
      was faced with similar problems at EMC.
    

      NEW ARRIVAL
    

      In January 2000 at EMC, the then CEO Mike Ruettgers hired Tucci as his
      CEO-in-training (in the newly created position of president and COO) after
      a four-month recruitment effort, saying Tucci was the only person he
      considered qualified for the job. When Tucci assumed the leadership role a
      year later, he was handed a company with a terrific financial record.
      Ruettgers had successfully spurred the company's growth for a
      decade, at an average annual revenue increase of 37 percent. Between 1997
      and 1999 the data-storage powerhouse doubled its revenues to $8.87
      billion; by 2000 EMC was the clear market leader in information storage.
    

      When Ruettgers stepped down in January 2001, the bull stock market that
      had helped support the company's 10 years' worth of fabulous
      returns disappeared. However, Tucci was not disheartened when EMC failed
      to meet its first-quarter earnings projections in April 2001—for
      the first time in five years—due to the collapse of the technology
      industry. He wisely adhered to the same formula he had successfully
      employed at Wang, strenuously slashing expenses and comprehensively
      renovating the existing business model.
    

      CHALLENGES CONFRONTED
    

      Faced with a different economic world, one of Tucci's biggest
      challenges would be to change the company's culture of isolation to
      one of effective cooperation with both customers and rivals. Prior to
      Tucci's joining the company, employees at EMC had developed an
      exaggerated superior attitude with respect to the company's
      products, complete with a "take it or leave it" approach
      with regards to product sales. Tucci ushered in a more customer-friendly
      attitude when he relinquished the company's exclusive use of
      direct, competitive sales in order to adopt the additional strategy of
      selling products indirectly through partners, which lowered expenses.
      Tucci also initiated sales of storage software to customers who used rival
      hardware, rather than only to its own hardware customers.
    

      EXTENDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
    

      Another of Tucci's rescue tactics was to forcibly drive the company
      to extend its market and technology leadership, beyond high-end
      information-storage systems and software and into comprehensive
      information-management solutions. Tucci also directed the company to
      reduce staff, refocus business units, tighten expenses, and reduce
      inventories in order to ensure its future profitability.
    

      Keeping in mind a long-term commitment to cutting expenses while
      continuing to invest in new technology, Tucci instituted the most
      enterprising schedule of new-product introductions in EMC's
      history, remodeling the company's existing product line in the
      process. Successful innovations included the CLARiiON CX series, which
      positioned EMC as the price and performance leader in midlevel storage;
      the visionary high-end storage architecture of the Symmetrix Direct
      Matrix; the Centera Content Addressed Storage, which established a new
      category of storage for the fixed-content market; and the expansion of the
      Celerra series of network-attached storage.
    

      Tucci also ushered EMC into the field of open-storage management software,
      overseeing the introduction of an expanded line of multiplatform software
      that was eventually recognized by analysts as as being the best in the
      industry. In 2003 Tucci led EMC's acquisition of three leading
      independent software providers: Documentum, specializing in enterprise
      content management; LEGATO Systems, specializing in backup, recovery, and
      other storage; and VMware, specializing in server virtualization.
    

      END RESULTS
    

      In the latter part of 2001 Tucci was able to begin lowering EMC's
      cost structure, increasing cash and investments, and strengthening
      management through the hiring of executives from other major technology
      companies. Tucci expanded
       EMC's Global Alliances and Professional Services programs and
      acquired six additional software companies. He committed about
      three-fourths of EMC's 2001 research and development budget to
      strengthening the company's information-storage software and
      focused the company on delivering information-storage solutions, which
      reduced the total expense of operations and created additional value for
      EMC's stockholders.
    

      After the two terrible years of 2001 and 2002 had resulted in more than
      $620 million in total losses, thousands of employee layoffs, market-share
      reductions, and a lessening of pricing power, EMC regained its footing in
      2003. Tucci spent more than $3.6 billion to strengthen its product line,
      acquire five software companies, and further shift its revenue ratio
      toward higher-margin software rather than hardware. Lisa Di-Carlo of 
      
        Forbes.com
      
       reported that the Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich stated in a
      research report, "EMS appears well positioned in that storage
      remains a high spending priority, and execution has been excellent"
      (January 22, 2004). In an article by Sean Kelly for Communication News,
      Tucci was quoted, in reflecting on the troubling times at Wang and EMC, as
      saying, "Leading through those times can be extra challenging, but
      also extra rewarding. If you have strong leadership, people look
      up" (January 2002).
    

      As of 2004, thanks to Tucci's leadership, EMC continued to be the
      world leader in information storage, retrieval, and management, helping
      organizations such as retailers, banks, Internet service providers,
      manufacturers, and government agencies incur low costs and receive premium
      value from EMC's comprehensive spectrum of information services.
      Revenues from 2003 totaled $6.24 billion.
    

      TYPE A AGGRESSIVE
    

      Tucci described himself as type A aggressive and was significantly more
      outspoken than his predecessor at EMC. While in training for the CEO
      position, he told analysts that EMC would be the leader in the
      network-attached storage market by the end of 2001 (it was ranked second
      at the time). The news media widely reported the bold, attention-grabbing
      prediction. In recalling that incident, Tucci gave credit to his employees
      for believing in his goal and making it become a reality. By the end of
      the first quarter of 2001, EMC had posted revenues of $285 million, which
      was tops in the network-attached storage market; the former leader had
      dropped to second with revenues of $226 million.
    

      OTHER DUTIES
    

      Tucci was also a director of Paychex, a provider of payroll, benefits, and
      human-resources solutions. He was chairman of EMC's Stock
      Repurchase and Bond Redemption Oversight Committee and a member of the
      Mergers and Acquisitions Committee. He was one of 150 CEO members of The
      Business Roundtable and chaired its Task Force on Education and the
      Workforce. He was one of eight chief executives who directed the Computer
      Systems Policy Project, the leading technology-advocacy organization
      within the industry. Tucci was also a member of the Board of Advisors of
      the Carroll School of Management at Boston College and the School of
      Economics and Management at Tsinghua University in Beijing. His hobbies
      included skiing, golf, scuba diving, boating, and other water-related
      activities.

For Joseph M. Tucci, the chief executive of EMC, completing the largest technology deal in history may mean as much for his reputation as it does for his bank account.The 68-year-old had been flirting with retirement since 2009, postponing it several times in the face of slumping stock performance, pressure from an activist investor and a changing environment for computer storage. In agreeing to a $67 billion acquisition of EMC by Dell, Mr. Tucci, who will step down as part of the deal, has the opportunity to resurrect his legacy and generate about $27 million more in compensation than had he willingly retired.“He wanted to be the guy who drove whatever was going to happen in EMC’s next phase,” said Glenn O’Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research, who worked at EMC in strategy and marketing from 2005 to 2008. “He built EMC into what it is. This is his baby, and he didn’t want to see it get ripped apart.”For Mr. Tucci, this transaction was more about being a battle-tested dealmaker than his payday, said Mr. O’Donnell. Mr. Tucci agreed to stay as EMC chairman and chief executive until the transaction was completed, according to a statement on Monday. After that, when he leaves, he will be owed $27.2 million by EMC, according to data compiled by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. Had he willingly retired — as he said he would do in 2012, 2013 and earlier this year — Mr. Tucci would have received a mere $123,636, the data showed. Continue reading the main story

Mr. Tucci, through an EMC spokesman, declined to comment on the pay package.Mr. Tucci felt the pressure to act after Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund run by Paul Singer, amassed a stake in EMC in 2014 and pushed for a breakup. The market was unhappy with the results of EMC’s conglomeratelike structure; the company’s share price declined about 15 percent over the last three years, before the deal was announced. For Mr. Tucci, however, Elliott’s idea of spinning off VMware, the virtualization software specialist in which EMC owns an 80 percent stake, was not the ideal option. He looked at the large structure of EMC “almost as one of his kids,” said Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets.

Michael Dell on $67 Billion Deal for EMC


Michael S. Dell, right, and his counterpart at EMC, Joe Tucci, explain why they are getting bigger at a time when companies of all stripes believe smaller is better.

Rather than succumb to Elliott’s exact wishes, Mr. Tucci sought another way out for EMC. About a year ago, reports surfaced that EMC had been in discussions with Hewlett-Packard about a merger, although those talks ended in 2014, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Discussions with Dell have been going on for about a year as well, Dell’s founder, Michael Dell, said on CNBC on Monday. Elliott ultimately said it supported the acquisition, in which Dell agreed to pay $33.15 per EMC share, including cash and tracking stock linked to EMC’s stake in VMware.“I don’t think he wanted to go out in a bad way by being forced into a breakup,” Mr. Ives said of Mr. Tucci. “This way, he’s able to put a bow around his career, and it’s a good way to end a few bad years.”

Mr. Tucci has been chief executive of EMC since 2001 and chairman since 2006. During his tenure at the storage provider, Mr. Tucci delved into acquisitions and partnerships of his own. He was known for expanding the company beyond large enterprise customers to small and midsize businesses. Before EMC, he was chairman and chief executive of Wang Global, then a computer manufacturer, where he led the company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company was acquired by Getronics NV in 1999.The compensation Mr. Tucci will receive is what is known as a change-in-control package, or pay owed to management if employment is terminated through an acquisition. It is typically larger than other types of chief executive termination pay. Without that incentive, management might be disinclined to agree to acquisitions, even those that could be in the best interest of shareholders.


            A Brief History of EMC        

            The data storage company grew into a collection of businesses, including network security and content management for corporate clients.        



 



Retirement packages are designed to be smaller, often without a cash component and limited equity, according to Courtney Yu, senior research analyst at Equilar. In Mr. Tucci’s case, only his options would have continued vesting, while his stock awards would have been forfeited, Mr. Yu said. If his equity had been allowed to vest, he would have had about $20 million, rather than $123,636, the data showed.But money and a decades-long career aside, Monday’s announcement is not the end of Mr. Tucci’s story, according to Mr. Ives of FBR Capital Markets.“In terms of legacy, it’s really going to depend on how, longer-term, this deal ends up,” he said. “If we look out two or three years from now, and Dell was really able to pull this off, then from start to finish he changed the landscape. If it doesn’t work out — I think the Street is leery about an integration this big — I think there will be a complicated legacy for him.”

JASON GROW/File 2008
Joseph Tucci has been EMC’s chief executive since 2001 and its chairman since 2006. 



By Beth Healy
	Globe Staff 
	October 13, 2015







Joseph M. Tucci clung fiercely to the top job at EMC Corp. for a decade and a half, from the bursting of the dot-com bubble through the Great Recession and the cloud revolution, until ultimately agreeing to sell the region’s last technology giant to Texas’s Dell Inc. this week.Tucci, 68, has been chief executive of the Hopkinton-based data storage company since 2001, and chairman since 2006, overseeing a period of technological change and numerous acquisitions to help broaden EMC’s offerings. He has fended off takeover rumors for years, and faced intense pressure recently from an activist hedge fund manager to break the company into parts.

Today, the company Tucci is selling for some $67 billion employs nearly 10,000 people in Massachusetts and 70,000 globally. It had more than $24 billion in revenue last year.“EMC has a tremendous legacy,’’ said Tom Hopcroft, chief executive of the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council. Under Tucci and his predecessors, he said, “They have been a longtime important contributor to our economy.”

It has hardly been without setbacks.EMC shares hit nearly $100 during the dot-com frenzy but slumped below $5 in 2002. EMC shares closed at $28.35 Monday.

 Dell-EMC deal poses questions for Mass. tech industry
The sale amplifies the region’s long-running anxiety about falling behind West Coast competitors in one of the economy’s most dynamic sectors. 






Over 10 years, the shares are up more than 100 percent, thanks in large part to acquisitions of the software maker VMware Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., and two Massachusetts companies, RSA Security and Data General Corp. Under Tucci, EMC has spent billions of dollars on some 70 deals. Along with those acquisitions, Tucci has shown himself to be a master of cost-cutting and layoffs on the way to growing the company.A New Yorker who went to college in Manhattan and earned a master’s degree in business policy at Columbia
, Tucci played semipro baseball before diving into the technology sector as a programmer for RCA Corp. Tucci worked for a number of high-tech firms, eventually earning his reputation as a turnaround manager as chief executive of bankrupt Wang Laboratories, which he revived and sold in 1999.

Jack Connors, the retired Boston advertising executive, said he has known Tucci since his Wang days and that “he may be the hardest-working executive I have ever known.”Tucci puts in 100-hour weeks and travels the world on EMC business, Connors said. He had to, to get past the global drop in demand after the frenzied sales for Y2K, when companies spent heavily to protect data against hypothetical system problems at the turn of the new century, and to dig out of the hole the company was in after the tech bubble burst. Tucci himself, in an interview with a recruiting firm, recalled cutting 7,000 jobs, amid hundreds of millions of dollars in losses at the time.As the Internet became dominant and more companies turned to cloud services that allowed them to store data without buying expensive servers, EMC was faced with decreasing demand for its staple product. Tucci pivoted, buying software firms, a data security company, and smaller storage-device makers. His 2004 deal to buy VMware for $625 million was perhaps his boldest move, giving the company a foothold in cloud computing.“In a very challenging environment, he made a lot of stockholders a lot of money,’’ Connors said.Tucci was handsomely rewarded for his efforts. He routinely appears on lists of highest-paid executives in technology and in Massachusetts: He earned $11.2 million in 2014, down from $12.6 million in 2013.He has been talking about retiring for years, but kept staying on, receiving bonuses for doing so. Tucci could potentially receive $39 million in cash severance and accelerated stock awards and options if he is let go without cause following the merger, according to EMC’s filing with securities regulators in March.The deal could lift the value of Tucci’s own stock holdings. Tucci owned or had options to buy a total of 2.7 million shares, according to the SEC filing, that could be valued at more than $90 million under the terms of the takeover deal with Dell.Tucci joins a list of the region’s chief executives whose final act with companies they helped build was to sell them, including Henry Termeer’s 2011 sale of drug maker Genzyme to France’s Sanofi-Aventis and David D’Alessandro’s sale of John Hancock Financial Services in 2003 to Canada’s Manulife Financial Corp.
“It’s a story we’ve seen before,’’ said Hopcroft of the technology council. “Hopefully we’ll see that seasoned expertise [from EMC] connecting with some of the amazing startups we have 
here.”Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund that has been dogging Tucci to find buyers for EMC’s various parts, on Monday praised the sale to Dell.“For EMC, this moment represents the culmination of Joe Tucci’s and his team’s work to create one of the most important technology companies of our time,’’ Elliott said in a statement. The firm also commended Michael Dell and financiers at the private equity group Silver Lake “for their vision and creativity in recognizing EMC’s unrealized value.”

Joseph M. Tucci



 Co-chief executive officer and co-chairman of GTY Technology Holdings; former chairman and chief executive officer of EMC Corporation


Joe Tucci, 69, is the co-chief executive officer and co-chairman of GTY Technology Holdings. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of EMC Corporation. He was EMC's chairman from January 2006 and CEO from January 2001 until September 2016, when Dell Technologies acquired the company. At that time, he became an advisor to the acquiring company’s founder, Michael Dell, and its board of directors.

Tucci led EMC through a dramatic revitalization and repeated market share gains, transforming EMC’s business model from what had been a near-exclusive focus on high-end storage platforms into a federation of businesses that grew to include EMC, VMware, Pivotal, RSA, VCE and Virtustream.

Before joining EMC, Tucci directed the financial and operational rebirth of Wang Global during six years as its chairman and CEO. Prior to joining Wang in 1990, Tucci was president of U.S. Information Systems for Unisys Corporation, a position he assumed after the 1986 merger of Sperry and Burroughs that created Unisys. He began his career as a systems programmer at RCA Corporation and holds a bachelor's degree from Manhattan College and a master’s degree in Business Policy from Columbia University.
 
Tucci served as one of 150 CEO members of The Business Roundtable and chaired its Task Force on Education and the Workforce. He was one of eight chief executives who steered The Technology CEO Council, the IT industry's leading public policy advocacy organization. He is one of 16 business leaders who forged and guide the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership. Tucci is a founding member of the Strategic Advisory Board and now serves as chairman of Bridge Growth Partners, a private equity firm based in New York. He is a member of the board of directors of Paychex, Inc.; a member of the board of overseers of Columbia Business School; a member of the board of trustees of Northeastern University; a member of the Board of Advisors of the Carroll School of Management at Boston College; an overseer of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; and a member of the board of directors of the National Academy Foundation.

Press release issued by Redline, a division of DRAFTFCB Johannesburg, 25 Apr 2012  Visit our Press Office
Read in this storyFirst-quarter highlightsBusiness outlook EMC delivers ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit revenue, profit and EPS growth.First-quarter highlights:  * Consolidated revenue up 11% year-over-year.  * GAAP net income up 23% year-over-year; GAAP EPS up 29%.  * Non-GAAP net income up 17% year-over-year; non-GAAP EPS up 19%.  * Strong year-over-year percentage increases in gross and operating margins.  * Strong year-over-year increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow.

Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) has reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2012, marking the company's ninth consecutive quarter of achieving year-over-year double-digit growth for consolidated revenue, net income and EPS.  See alsoEMC introduces VSPEX Proven InfrastructureEMC acquires Pivotal LabsEMC CorporationIsilon   First-quarter consolidated revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of 11% compared with the year-ago quarter. First-quarter GAAP net income attributable to EMC increased 23% year-over-year to $587 million.First-quarter GAAP earnings per weighted average diluted share increased 29% year-over-year to $0.27. Non-GAAP (1) net income attributable to EMC for the first quarter was $818 million, an increase of 17% compared with the year-ago quarter. First-quarter non-GAAP (1) earnings per weighted average diluted share were $0.37, an increase of 19% year-over-year.During the first quarter, EMC generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow (2) of $1.4 billion, increases of 49% and 67% year-over-year, respectively. Additionally, the company significantly expanded GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin percentages on a year-over-year basis, and ended the quarter with $10.9 billion in cash and investments.Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: “We are in a time of unprecedented IT and business transformation, propelled by the benefits of cloud computing, big data and trust. EMC is off to a strong start to 2012 and is exceptionally well-positioned to help customers take advantage of these major transformational shifts. We have never been more excited about what this great technology company can accomplish and look forward to helping our customers drive maximum value from their IT investments in the years ahead.”David Goulden, EMC Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, said: “EMC's solid first-quarter results are ongoing proof that we are executing on our strategy and on track to deliver our 'triple play' – simultaneously taking market share, reinvesting for growth and delivering improved earnings this year. Based upon our strong start to the year and our opportunity, we now have greater confidence in our ability to meet and potentially exceed our 2012 financial goals for consolidated revenue, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Additionally, with continued steady execution, we are well on our way to achieving the financial potential of 2014 consolidated revenue of over $28 billion, which represents compound annual revenue growth of at least 13% from 2010 and non-GAAP EPS growth even greater than this.”First-quarter highlightsFirst-quarter highlights included strong customer demand for EMC's market-leading mid-tier storage products portfolio (3), which increased revenue 26% year-over-year. The company's Isilon scale-out NAS business nearly doubled its revenue year-over-year, and its VNX unified storage family, Backup Recovery Systems (BRS) portfolio, and Greenplum portfolio each delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth.Also during the quarter, EMC's RSA Information Security business increased revenue 19% year-over-year and revenue from VMware (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualisation and cloud infrastructure, grew 25% year-over-year. Additionally, EMC continued to experience strong customer demand for its broad portfolio of services to help customers accelerate to the cloud. Finally, VCE, the Virtual Computing Environment Company formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, continued its momentum as customer adoption of Vblock Converged Infrastructure Platforms increased significantly on a year-over-year basis.EMC's consolidated first-quarter revenue from the United States increased 11% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, representing 52% of consolidated first-quarter revenue. Revenue from EMC's business operations outside of the United States increased 10% year-over-year to $2.5 billion and represented 48% of consolidated first-quarter revenue. Within this, revenue in EMC's Asia Pacific and Japan region reached an all-time record level, growing 20% year-over-year. EMC's Europe, Middle East and Africa region grew revenue 6% year-over-year and EMC's Latin America region grew revenue 20% year-over-year.Business outlookThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof.

Excluded from non-GAAP non-operating expense is stock-based compensation expense of $5 million.* Consolidated GAAP net income attributable to EMC is expected to be $2.8 billion in 2012, and consolidated non-GAAP net income attributable to EMC is expected to be $3.8 billion in 2012.

See attached schedules for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, fewer additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalised software development costs. See attached schedules for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three months ended 31 March 2012 and 2011.(3) EMC's mid-tier storage products include EMC VNX, EMC CLARiiON, EMC Celerra, EMC Centera, EMC Data Domain, EMC Isilon, EMC Avamar and EMC Atmos hardware and software products.EMC, Atmos, Avamar, Celerra, Centera, CLARiiON, Data Domain, Greenplum, Isilon, RSA, Vblock, and VNX are either registered trademarks or trademarks of EMC Corporation in the United States and/or other countries. VMware is a registered trademark or trademark of VMware, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries. All other trademarks used are the property of their respective owners.Forward-looking statementsThis release contains “forward-looking statements” as defined under the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including but not limited to: (i) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (ii) delays or reductions in information technology spending; (iii) the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines and the volume and mixture of product and services revenues; (iv) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures and new product introductions; (v) component and product quality and availability; (vi) fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results and risks associated with trading of VMware stock; (vii) the transition to new products, the uncertainty of customer acceptance of new product offerings and rapid technological and market change; (viii) risks associated with managing the growth of our business, including risks associated with acquisitions and investments and the challenges and costs of integration, restructuring and achieving anticipated synergies; (ix) the ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees; (x) insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; (xi) fluctuating currency exchange rates; (xii) threats and other disruptions to our secure data centres or networks; (xiii) our ability to protect our proprietary technology; (xiv) war or acts of terrorism; and (xv) other one-time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in EMC's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. EMC disclaims any obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this release.Use of non-GAAP financial measuresThis release, the accompanying schedules and the additional content that is available on EMC's Web site contain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of EMC's performance or liquidity, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of EMC's financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. EMC's non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how EMC defines its non-GAAP financial measures in this release.Where specified in the accompanying schedules for various periods entitled: "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP", certain items noted on each such specific schedule (including, where noted, amounts relating to stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortisation, restructuring and acquisition-related charges and the amortisation of VMware's capitalised software from prior periods) are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures.EMC's management uses the non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying schedules to gain an understanding of EMC's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts) and future prospects and excludes the above-listed items from its internal financial statements for purposes of its internal budgets and each reporting segment's financial goals. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by EMC's management in their financial and operating decision-making because management believes they reflect EMC's ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. EMC's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others (a) in understanding and evaluating EMC's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and (b) in comparing in a consistent manner the company's current financial results with the company's past financial results.This release also includes disclosures regarding free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities fewer additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software development costs. EMC uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase shares, service debt and fund ongoing operations. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.All of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures have limitations. Specifically, the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the items noted above do not include all items of income and expense that affect EMC's operations. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and do not reflect any benefit that such items may confer on EMC. Management compensates for these limitations by also considering EMC's financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
