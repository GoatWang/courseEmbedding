Our sectors
Our On-Site Utility solutions have particularly benefitted organisations in the following sectors: 


HotelsLeisureHealthcareHousing Hotels
In the current economic climate hotel owners, operators and General Managers have found it increasingly difficult to improve occupancy rates, customer loyalty and sell out conference and banqueting facilities.  Add to this the substantial increase in operating costs attributed to the rise in energy costs and the introduction of much stricter environmental legislation and the net result has been much tighter margins in the hotel sector. We can change this for you.
In terms of the specific issues relating to energy consumption, the demand tends to come from the following areas:

Electricity use and hot water production for the whole site
Providing heat for swimming pools and leisure clubs
Air conditioning systems used either bedroom by bedroom or for the whole complex

Energy, water and carbon reduction have become extremely important issues for the hotel sector due to the fact that the majority of sites operate around the clock for 365 days a year.
EuroSite Power’s On-Site Utility™ Solution is the perfect solution for hotels seeking to lower their overall operating costs because you only pay for the energy you use.

 EUROSITE POWER INC. (OTCMKTS:EUSP) Files An 8-K Other Events

Item 8.01




Other Events




On December 29, 2016, EuroSite Power Inc. (the Company) filed a
Form 15 (12g Form 15) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to deregister its common stock under Section 12(g) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act). The
Company intends to file an additional Form 15 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on or about January 2, 2017 to Regulation
15d-6 under the Act. The Company is eligible to deregister its
common stock by filing a Form 15 under Section 12(g) and 15(d) of
the Act because the Company has fewer than 300 holders of record
of its common stock.


Upon the filing of the 12g Form 15, the Company’s obligation to
file periodic reports, such as Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K,
under Section 13(a) of the Act will be suspended immediately. The
deregistration under Section 12(g) of the Act is expected to be
effective 90 days after the filing of the 12g Form 15 at which
time the Company’s other filing requirements under Section 13(a)
of the Act will terminate.


The Company’s common stock is currently traded on the OTCQX
operated by the OTC Markets Group, a centralized electronic
quotation service for over-the-counter securities. Following the
suspension of the Company’s obligation to file periodic reports,
the Company anticipates its common stock will be traded on the
OTC Pink Market operated by the OTC Markets Group, so long as
market makers demonstrate an interest in trading in the
Company’s common stock. However, there is no assurance that
trading in the Company’s common stock will continue on the OTC
Pink Market or any other securities exchange or quotation medium.


In connection with the foregoing, inter alia, the
Company filed post-effective amendments to its Registrations
Statements on Form S-3 and Form S-8, removing from registration
any unsold common stock thereunder.


The decision of the Company’s Board of Directors to deregister
its common stock was based on the consideration of numerous
factors, including (i) the costs, both direct and indirect,
incurred by the Company each year in connection with preparing
and filing periodic reports with the SEC, (ii) the benefits of
permitting senior management of the Company to spend less time on
report preparation, which will allow them to devote full time and
attention to the Companys strategy and operations, (iii) the
substantial costs and expected further substantial increase in
accounting, legal and other costs associated with remaining a
registered public company in light of the requirements of SEC and
OTCQX rules, (iv) that the Company has not, other than raising
approximately $1.5 million in 2012, raised capital in the public
marketplace, nor does it expect to be in a position to do so in
the future, (v) that the Company has raised approximately fifteen
times that amount in private transactions and expects to be in a
position of only raising funds in such private transactions in
the foreseeable future, (vi) that the Company has not used, or
been in a position to use, its public stock to consummate
acquisitions, (vii) that the Companys status as a registered
public OTCQX-listed company or under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 has not necessarily enhanced its corporate image and has
not increased incentives associated with being a public company
for management and employees, (viii) the possible effects of
public disclosure of information relating to the Companys
business and operations to competitors, and (viii) the historic
low trading volume and significant price swings in the Company’s
common stock and potential loss of liquidity to stockholders,
(ix) the procedure, timing and costs associated with
deregistration, as well as the effects of deregistration and
deregistering on other public companies and (x) the Companys post
deregistration shareholder information plan under which the
Company would provide its stockholders with quarterly unaudited
financial information and annual audited financial statements and
update its stockholders with information about the Company and
the Board would continue to monitor the impact of deregistration.


On December 29, 2016 the Company issued a press release filed as
Exhibit 99.1 hereto announcing its intention to effect
deregistration and to suspend its reporting obligations under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Our technology

Home  >  Our technology



The technologies at the heart of EuroSite Power’s leading On-Site Utility™ solutions are Combined Heat and Power (CHP), sometimes know as Cogeneration, Gas-engine Driven Chillers and Heat Pumps but because we are not a manufacturer we are free to select the best product for your building although we generally choose systems from one of two technology partners – Tecogen or Tedom.
Tedom (www.cogeneration.tedom.com) is a Czech based CHP system manufacturer formed in 1994. They provide units ranging from 7kW to 10,000kW that offer high-quality solutions designed to meet the needs of most applications. With thousands of units installed worldwide and over 20 years of experience Tedom’s technology is ideally suited to EuroSite Power’s On-Site Utility™ approach. In the UK EuroSite Power is making use of Tedom’s Cento and Quanto ranges of CHP units with capacities ranging from 50kW to 4,500kW.
Tecogen (www.tecogen.com) is a US based manufacturer formed in the early 1960’s as the R&D/New Business Centre of Thermo Electron Corporation. They launched their first 60kWe CHP unit in 1982 followed in 1987 by a 530kW gas engine-driven chiller and the Ilios gas-engine heat pump in 2009. Since that time over 2,000 units had been installed worldwide and the range of CHP, chiller and heat pump products has been expanded. With over 30 years of gas engine experience and know-how the technology at the heart of EuroSite Power’s offer is both proven and reliable. In the UK EuroSite Power is making use of the innovative InVerde Ultera™ 100 low emissions CHP unit but can also provide both air-cooled and water-cooled chillers with capacities ranging from 90kW to 1400kW.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital 
purposes in connection with the development and installation of new energy 
systems such as cogeneration systems and chillers and for general corporate 
purposes which may include, among other things, potential acquisitions of 
companies, products and technologies that complement our business, although we 
have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any such 
transactions.


We believe that the main competition for DG products is the established 
electric utility infrastructure. DG is beginning to gain acceptance in regions 
where energy customers are dissatisfied with the cost and reliability of 
traditional electricity service. These end-users, together with growing 
support from regulators, are creating a favorable climate for the growth of DG 
that is overcoming the objections of established utility providers. Those 
companies are much larger than us in terms of revenues, assets and resources. 
We expect to compete with large utility companies by selling its electricity 
to the same commercial building customers at a lower price. We will sell 
directly to each building customer, but typically only supply 20%-60% of the 
electricity needs of the building. The remaining portion will be supplied by 
the electric utility.

In the United Kingdom, we will primarily compete with Cogenco Limited, a 
subsidiary of Dalkia PLC, an alternative energy company with customers in the 
50-500 kW range, ENER-G Holdings plc and Jenbacher, a subsidiary of General 
Electric Company. Other companies in the same market are Clarke Energy Ltd, EC 
Power Systems and Baxi-SenerTec UK. In Belgium, most CHP equipment 
manufacturers are non-Belgian companies, including CogenGreen S.A., Capstone 
Turbine Corporation and Cummins Power Generation Inc., which will be our 
primary competitors in the 50-500 kW range. In Spain, we will compete with 
Baxi-SenerTec UK, MicroPower Europe, Guascor Power, Cummins Power Generation 
Inc., Icogen SA and Pasch y Cia SA. Icogen SA, based in Barcelona, is the 
leading Spanish supplier for systems below 500 kW. 

Engine manufacturers sell DG units that range in size from a few kWs to many 
MWs in size. Those manufacturers are predominantly greater than 1 MW and 
include Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Power Generation Inc., and Waukesha, a 
subsidiary of General Electric Company. In many cases, we view these companies 
as potential suppliers of equipment and not as competitors.

The alternative energy market is emerging rapidly. Many companies are 
developing alternative and renewable energy sources including solar power, 
wind power, fuel cells and micro-turbines. Some of the companies in this 
sector include General Electric Company, BP p.l.c, Royal Dutch Shell, 
SunEdison, a division of MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc. and Evergreen Solar, 
Inc. (in the solar energy space); Plug Power, Inc. and FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
(in the fuel cell space); and Capstone Turbine Corporation , Ingersoll Rand 
PLC and Elliott Turbomachinery, a division of the Elliott Group, Inc. (in the 
micro-turbine space). The effect of these developing technologies on our 
business is difficult to predict; however, when their technologies become more 
viable for our target markets, we may be able to adopt their technologies into 
our business model. 

There are a number of energy service companies that offer related services. 
These companies include Siemens AG, Honeywell International Inc. and Johnson 
Controls Inc. In general, these companies seek large, diverse projects for 
electric demand reduction for campuses that include building lighting and 
controls, and electricity (in rare occasions) or cooling. Because of their 
overhead structures, these companies often solicit large projects and stay 
away from individual properties. Since we will focus on smaller projects for 
energy supply, we will be well suited to work in tandem with these companies 
when the opportunity arises.
 
There are also a few local emerging cogeneration developers and contractors 
that are attempting to offer services similar to ours. To be successful, they 
will need to have the proper experience in equipment and technology, 
installation contracting, equipment maintenance and operation, site economic 
evaluation, project financing and energy sales plus the capability to cover a 
broad region.


Company Description
We distribute, own and operate clean, on-site energy systems that produce 
electricity, hot water, heat and cooling in the United Kingdom and Europe. Our 
business model is to own the equipment that we install at customers’ 
facilities and to sell the energy produced by these systems to the


 customers 
on a long-term contractual basis at prices guaranteed to the customer to be 
below conventional utility rates. Because our systems may operate at up to 90% 
efficiency, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, Energy 
Generation and Distribution Efficiency, (versus less than 33% for the existing 
power grid), we expect to be able to sell the energy produced by these systems 
to our customers at prices below their existing cost of electricity (or air 
conditioning), heat and hot water.

We offer natural gas powered cogeneration systems that are highly reliable and 
energy efficient. Our cogeneration systems produce electricity from an 
internal combustion engine driving a generator, while the heat from the engine 
and exhaust is recovered and typically used to produce heat and hot water for 
use at the site. We also distribute and operate water chiller systems for 
building cooling applications that operate in a similar manner, except that 
the engine’s power drives a large air-conditioning compressor while recovering 
heat for hot water. Cogeneration systems reduce the amount of electricity that 
the customer must purchase from the local utility and produce valuable heat 
and hot water for the site to use as required. By simultaneously providing 
electricity, hot water and heat, cogeneration systems also have a significant 
positive impact on the environment by reducing the carbon or CO 2 produced by 
offsetting the traditional energy supplied by the electric grid and 
conventional hot water boilers.

Distributed generation of electricity, or DG, often referred to as 
cogeneration systems, or combined heat and power systems, or CHP, is an 
attractive option for reducing energy costs and increasing the reliability of 
available energy. DG has been successfully implemented by others in large 
industrial installations over 10 Megawatts, or MW, where the market has been 
growing for a number of years, and is increasingly being accepted in smaller 
size units because of technology improvements, increased energy costs and 
better DG economics. We believe that our target market (users of up to 1 MW) 
has been barely penetrated and that the reduced reliability of the utility 
grid, increasing cost pressures experienced by energy users, advances in new, 
low-cost technologies and DG-favorable legislation and regulation at the state 
and federal level will drive our near-term growth and penetration into our 
target market.

We believe that our primary near-term opportunity for DG energy and equipment 
sales is where commercial electricity rates exceed $0.12 per kWh. Attractive 
DG economics in the United Kingdom and Europe are currently attainable in 
applications that include hospitals, nursing homes, multi-tenant residential 
housing, hotels, schools and colleges, recreational facilities, food 
processing plants, dairies and other light industrial facilities.

Early in 2010, American DG Energy performed a feasibility study of the 
European market to determine the viability of expanding its On-Site Utility 
business into Europe. This study and business plan report reached the 
conclusions that: (a) there is untapped customer demand to provide small-scale 
CHP packages in the commercial sector through a fully financed, output-based 
electricity and hot water contract, (b) there is a lack of competition in this 
space in the target customer segments (hotel, healthcare and multi-tenant 
residential) and (c) the underlying economic fundamentals are attainable, with 
a combination of sufficient spark spreads and government fiscal support.

The study analyzed the entire European market; however, it focused on the 
United Kingdom, Spain and Belgium as the primary markets to start operations. 
The study estimated that there are over 13,700 sites in those three countries 
providing a $900 million annual electricity market plus a $600 million heat 
and hot water energy market, for a combined market potential of $1.5 billion. 
The data used to calculate the Company’s market potential is derived by 
Company estimates.

We purchase energy equipment from various suppliers. The primary type of 
equipment used is a natural gas-powered, reciprocating engine provided by 
Tecogen Inc., or Tecogen, an affiliate of the Company. Tecogen is a leading 
manufacturer of natural gas, engine-driven commercial and industrial cooling 
and cogeneration systems suitable for a variety of applications, including 
hospitals, nursing homes and schools. The internal combustion reciprocating 
engine is provided to Tecogen by General Motors Corporation. 

We were organized as a Delaware corporation in July 2010. Our principal 
executive offices are located at 45 First Avenue, Waltham, Massachusetts 
02451, and our telephone number is (781) 522-6000. Our website address is 
www.eurositepower.co.uk.
