Former Emulex CEO Jeffrey Benck Joins Lantronix as President and Chief Executive Officer





Irvine, Calif. – Dec. 7, 2015 – Lantronix, Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRX) – a specialized networking company providing smart IoT and M2M connectivity solutions – today announced that Jeffrey W. Benck, 50, has been appointed as president and chief executive officer of the company, effective immediately. Benck has also been appointed to the company’s board of directors.
“We are pleased to have a proven successful leader of Jeff’s caliber joining Lantronix,” said Bernhard Bruscha, chairman of Lantronix’s board of directors. “The board is confident that Jeff’s deep operational skills and extensive technology industry experience make him the right person to strengthen Lantronix’s leadership in the marketplace and take it to the next level.”
“Lantronix has innovative technology that is needed by the industry to enable otherwise unconnected machines to communicate with the rest of the world, just as the ‘Internet of Things’ moves into its broad adoption phase. Lantronix has a reputation for developing leading-edge solutions to address the secure connectivity issues that most organizations face today,” said Benck. “I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to work with a very talented group of Lantronix employees in building upon this foundation and enhancing long-term shareholder value by leading the company in its next phase of growth.”
Most recently, Benck served as president and chief executive officer of Emulex Corporation, a global supplier of advanced networking, monitoring and management solutions, from July 2013 until Emulex was acquired by Avago Technologies in May 2015. He joined Emulex in May 2008 as executive vice president and chief operating officer and was subsequently appointed to president and chief operating officer in August 2010. Prior to joining Emulex, Benck was president and chief operating officer of QLogic Corporation, a supplier of storage networking solutions. Earlier, he spent 18 years at IBM Corporation where he held a variety of executive leadership roles, including serving as vice president of xSeries, BladeCenter and Retail Store Solutions development. Benck holds a master of science degree in management of technology from University of Miami and a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology. He and his family reside in Orange County, California.
The company will grant Mr. Benck an inducement award of 450,000 restricted share units (RSUs) in connection with the commencement of his employment. The shares subject to the inducement award shall vest according to the following schedule: one-third (150,000) of the RSUs shall vest on December 1, 2016 and the remaining RSUs shall vest ratably each quarter thereafter for a period of 24 months. The RSUs will be issued as employment inducement awards in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Lantronix Incorporated Second Quarter and Full year 2017 Conference Call. All participants will be listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there’ll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to E.E. Wang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
E.E. Wang
Thank you, William. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the Lantronix fiscal 2017 second quarter conference call.
Joining us on the call today are Jeff Benck, Lantronix’s President and CEO and Jeremy Whitaker, Lantronix’s CFO. A live and archived webcast of today’s call will be available on the company’s website at www.lantronix.com. In addition, a phone replay will be available starting at 08:00 PM Eastern, 05:00 PM Pacific today through February 02, by dialing 877-344-7529 in the United States or for international callers, 412-317-0888 and entering pass code 10099548.
During this call, management may make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Lantronix’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website, and in the company’s SEC filings such as its 10-K and 10-Qs. Lantronix undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
Also please note that during this call, the company will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. Today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, describes the differences between our non-GAAP and GAAP reporting and presents reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures that we use.
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Benck, President and CEO of Lantronix.
Jeff Benck
Thanks E.E., and welcome to everyone joining us for this afternoon’s call.
As you may have seen from our preannouncement or from the release earlier today, we delivered our best quarter today since I joined the company a year ago. In the December quarter, we achieved revenue of $11.2 million representing 18% year-over-year topline growth and recorded GAAP breakeven earnings per share.
Couple this with our fourth quarter of consecutive revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability and it demonstrates solid progress. Contributing to our results in the quarter, our IT management business has shown consistent year-over-year growth through improving deal win rates, competitive takeaways and deeper channel engagement.
Q2 was no exception as these actions contributed to the third consecutive quarter of more than a 100% year-over-year growth and the SLC 8000 sales and our channel expansion efforts continue to tract more partners, expanding our reach with more people selling our products.
In addition, we continue to make progress in our IOT business. Our IOT products also experienced strong year-over-year growth in Q2, led by a few new design wins for our wired Ethernet product in the commercial and industrial verticals. We also launched a new IOT device gateway the SGX 5150, which we believe will help us more broadly participate in the growing wireless IOT market.
Lastly just yesterday, we announced the development of MACH10, a key technology that will enable us to move up the IOT value chain. MACH10 is a multidimensional management software platform designed to help OEMs accelerate IOT application deployment and achieve greater value from the smart connected machines.

Overall, we had a nice recovery over the last 12 months, while we fully expected that it would take time for all over changes to have an impact, it's clear that we are moving in the right direction. At the same time, rest assured we are not taking the pressure off ourselves to do more.
Before I provide some additional insight on our business, I am going to turn the call over to Jeremy to discuss our financial results from the second quarter.
Jeremy Whitaker
Thank you. Jeff. Please refer to today's news release and the financial information in the Investor Relations section of our website for additional details that will supplement my financial commentary.
Now I would like to take a few minutes to go over our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we achieved net revenue of $11.2 million, slightly above the range we provided in our preannouncement two weeks ago. This represents growth of 18% when compared to $9.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
The growth was due to increased sales in both our IOT and IT management product lines. More specifically, our IOT product line increased by 17% as sales of many of our embedded products improved from the year ago quarter.
In addition our IT and product line increased by 72% primarily as a result of over 100% growth in our SLC 8000 Advanced Console Manager and to a lesser extent improved traction in our SLB branch office manager.
Sequentially, we experienced growth of 3%, primarily driven by our IOT product line. A good portion of the sequential growth can be attributed to a couple of large new wire designs that shipped during the quarter. Sequentially, our IT management product line was down 7% as our SLC 8000 decreased from a recent record high. On a positive note, this decline was partially offset by improved traction in our SLB.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 51.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with 48.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 52.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The improvement from the year ago quarter was primarily due to lower overhead costs and improved product mix.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $3.9 million compared with $3.8 million for both the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Our research and development expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1.9 million compared with $1.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our continued revenue growth and financial discipline helped us to achieve GAAP net income of $41,000 or breakeven earnings per share, a substantial improvement from the same period last year when we recorded a GAAP net loss of $928,000 or $0.06 per share.
We also saw sequential improvement from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we recorded a GAAP net loss of $104,000 or $0.01 per share. I'm also pleased to report our fourth consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability as we achieved non-GAAP net income of $444,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $196,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and non-GAAP net income of $265,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Now turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents increased to $6.7 million as of December 31, 2016, compared with $6 million as of June 30, 2016. Sequentially, net inventories increased slightly from $7.4 million as of September 30, 2016 to $7.6 million as of December 31, 2016.
Working capital increased to $9.6 million as of December 31, 2016 compared with $9.1 million as of June 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit. In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress that we made this quarter, which resulted in achievement of GAAP profitability.

Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to maintain our gross margins at around 50%. With respect to operating expenses, we expect spending to be in line with the second fiscal quarter as we continue to drive discipline across the organization.
I'll now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Benck
Thanks Jeremy. As we shared at the start of fiscal 2017, we're focused on three key initiatives this year; driving operational excellence to improve the fundamentals of our business, fueling continued growth in our IT management product line through shared gains and executing on our strategic product roadmap, including investing in new offerings to more broadly participate in the fast growing IOT market.
First let's review our progress on operational excellence. Our December quarter results and associated cash generation, demonstrates the impact we can have on our business when we drive topline growth, improve product costs, our discipline and deal pricing and closely manager operating expenses.
Our progress is striking when you consider that we went from a $928,000 GAAP net loss in the second quarter of fiscal year '16 to achieving $41,000 of GAAP net income one year later, an improvement of nearly $1 million.
Our efforts to rebuild and strengthen our sales team in the Americas paid dividends as that region grew significantly year-over-year in the quarter and outperformed our EMEA and APJ businesses. The revitalization on our Americas sales organization has also helped to drive new opportunities in customer reengagement in our IOT business, which contributed in part to the 17% year-over-year increase in sales of our IOT product line during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Turning to our second initiative, we experienced substantial year-over-year growth in our IT management business by closing key deals, effective marketing spend and improved channel engagement. Total IT management sales were up 72% year-over-year as the SLC 8000 revenues grew by more than 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. With this level of growth I'm confident that we gain share in the quarter.
As Jeremy mentioned, we are also starting to see more demand for our SLB Branch Office Manager solution. In many of our enterprise accounts, the SLB is a natural complement to our SLC 8000, which allows customers to remotely manage their networking and storage equipment in data centers.
Our SLB product enables these same customers to remotely manage their distributed sites or branch locations where they are less likely to have IT staff present. We are one of the few IT management suppliers to offer this breadth of management appliances.
Now turning to our IOT efforts, we continue to execute on our strategic product development plan. As I stated before, our mission is to deliver secure data access and management solutions that make it easier for companies to access the benefit of the Internet of Things. In line with this vision, in October we launched the SGX 5150, an advanced IOT device gateway.
Expanding our IOT product portfolio, featuring multiple interfaces, advanced Wi-Fi, leading-edge management features and true port security, the STX 5150 provides a flexible and secure solution for organizations seeking to connect virtually any business asset to the Internet.
Finally, since December of 2015 we have communicated that we are investing for growth in IOT. As many of you are aware Lantronix has historically been focused on end to end connectivity and our solutions have been deployed into millions of OEM machines worldwide.
If you've been following us over the last year, you've heard me talk about how we have been identifying new technologies that will help companies simplify their IOT deployment efforts and expand our solutions beyond just hardware. This week we took a major step in this direction with the announcement of MACH10, a new IOT management software platform provided by Lantronix.

This OEM centric platform leverages our more than 20 years of first-hand experience as an IOT hardware provider to thousands of OEMs and has been architected from the ground up to address the gaps we see in the marketplace. Today most IOT platforms provide infrastructure to move some data between the device and cloud, leaving the complexity of building applications around the data to the OEM.
MACH10 starts where other IOT platform stop by enabling OEMs to quickly and profitably deliver web scale IOT applications and services. We have already started to preview the new platform with our current IOT customers and are pleased with the positive feedback we are receiving and we intend to have customers working with the platform later this year.
Now let me wrap up. I am pleased with the strong results we achieved in the first half of fiscal 2017. Our team continues to push full speed ahead. While we have a lot more to accomplish, we are 100% aligned, committed and fully believe that our plan is one that will allow us to win in the marketplace and achieve greater value for our shareholders.
That completes our prepared remarks for today. So, I will now turn it over to the operator to conduct the Q&A session. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first questioner today is Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jaeson Schmidt
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong quarter. Just wanted to start with the MACH10 product, just curious if you provide some more color around the potential impact to the model longer-term? Are you looking at this as a new additive revenue stream or do you think this will mostly just feel the pull through of your product revenue?
Jeff Benck
Yes, thanks Jaeson, that's a great question. As we think about the model longer-term, we do see an incremental revenue stream that will come from software. As you know that is a different model in the sense that as we talk about subscriptions on software and how we recognize revenue, some of that will come over time, but it'll also give us an annuity as we build up that customer base.
I might also add though you can't hinted at it, we see this software platform adding additional capability to our gateway offerings as well and there is an element of device management of just our own gateways that we will look to provide some of that capability with our gateway solution and not charge for that.
But we obviously see a much bigger opportunity that goes beyond our own devices and allows us to play in an IOT management software platform space and really help to solve problems for customers that aren’t even working with us today.
So, it's going to take time. We announced the platform and what we were trying to do as the tech preview this week with the intent of getting out there with customers and telling them where we were headed, investors of assets say you guys you were investing in software, give us an idea that problems you're trying to solve and we wanted to start to share more details on that.
And then as we get closer to product launch later this year, we'll certainly share a lot more detail on the modeling and how we think about it, but we do see an incremental opportunity there, which will be higher margin, but there will also be expense that goes with supporting that.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. That's helpful. And then you guys have had great success with the SLC 8000 product, just wondering if you could talk about why you're waiting all these design wins, is it performance, is it price, the combination.
Jeff Benck
Well, I think you can see from our improving margins it's not price. We'll be aggressive when we're competitive with other guys in the space but we really -- it isn't been our price play for us. We frankly in this segment, I think it's a segment that hasn't had a lot of attention in the marketplace and our product is so much newer than a lot of the competition and the SLC 8000 is a modular offering that kind of lets customers start small and pay as they go if they want to add capability to it.

And we also have capability like USB, support for USB connections that most of the competition hasn’t had. Few people are starting at add it now. I think they’ve seen our lead there, but it's really been some good differentiation in the platform and coupled with we've done a better job describing the customers the value we bring.
We've engaged a channel -- with some channel programs. So, we had more partners helping us there and as you know, we've added some additional sales staff into the field as well, but if we really start the product, we've got a leadership product and that's really helped us be able to get into accounts.
When we go into a bake off, I got to say the success rate has been really good and we won some fairly large customers and some of those that have been customers that have done business with us before, but we also look at are we getting incremental wins and we see a host of those happening as well.
It is a deal driven business also. Sometimes they come in big chunks sometimes. So, every quarter we're working on what's the next opportunity and is it going to close this quarter or next quarter and how the things move around within the segment, but we've been achieving our goal of share gain, that's for sure because we don't believe the segment's really growing, but with the kind of numbers we've put up, there's no question we're gaining share in the segment.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. That's helpful. And then the last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue, just wonder if you could comment on your thoughts regarding inventory levels at the distributors?
Jeff Benck
Well, we haven’t, we depending on our model right, we take revenue on sales out for customers that are buying products like our IT management offerings and we have a mix of different distributers that we deal with, but we really -- we look at them. We haven't seen a marked move in inventory. Do you want to add color on that?
Jeremy Whitaker
Yes, as Jeff was saying we do defer much of our revenue until sell-through. So, we put the inventory of a large portion of our distributors on our books as a deferred cost and inventories and we have seen a slight decline in inventories coming from last quarter, but overall, it's relatively consistent.
Jeff Benck
Yes, it's within…
Jeremy Whitaker
Within a couple $100,000.
Jeff Benck
So, it hasn’t moved tremendous. So, I think we talked about our inventory being up a couple hundred and we haven't seen growth in channel inventory. I don't know if you were getting at maybe we should add say, there is something else you were looking at or just trying to understandable if we're seeing industry trends changing.
Jaeson Schmidt
No, that answer was very helpful. That's really all I had guys. Thanks a lot.
Jeff Benck
Yes, no problem. Thank you.
Operator
Our next questioner today is Mark Spiegel with Stanphyl Capital. Please go ahead.
Mark Spiegel
Yes. Thank you. Congratulations, really great to see how you guys are turning the company around and as a shareholder for a while I appreciate it. Couple of questions, obviously it seems like most of the growth is coming from the IT management start with plus 72% of the SLC 8000 is up 100%.
It would be helpful -- I'd like to know how sustainable that is and I guess one way to determine that would be for you guys to tell us what kind of market share these products have and that will give us slightly how much bigger they can get.
Jeff Benck
Okay. I can give you -- one thing that's a little challenging here is that Gartner and IDC don't actually track the management console space that the SLC plays into. So, we've been pressing a bit on talking to our partners and distributors that carry multiple lines and as best we can tell we believe we actually have very modest share in the single digit range, probably the mid-single to maybe we're starting to trend up to high single-digits.

So, we think there is -- were relatively a pretty small player. Now there are five or six guys in this segment. So, it's distributed a bit. Allison no question is a big gorilla and they might have 40%, 50% share if I was to venture a guess, but where believe we are is in the single digit range.
So, we think there is more opportunity there. As we said, it's pretty deal driven but we've certainly seen a bit of a revitalization within the company the opportunity that that represents. We touched on I am not sure you saw or you heard, but the SLB is like the little brother to the SLC and it really goes in the branch environment, but also does remote management and monitoring of infrastructure whether you have storage or services or switches.
And we see some interesting opportunities there as well that people might be doing branch rollouts or look at they don't have the IT folks inside and they want to be able to manage that infrastructure. So, it's early yet, but there's definitely a stronger pipeline in that segment too and we think when we couple those together, the IT management space could be pretty interesting for us.
Mark Spiegel
Okay. And then on MACH10 helping is that market opportunity and when are you going to start seeing some revenue from there? I know you said later this year you'll start rolling it out, but I don't know if that's for testing or what? Can you just give us a little color on that?
Jeff Benck
Yeah, and I am going to be a little cagy because it's a competitive space and it's early, but I can tell you that we will definitely be looking this calendar year to sell product, but it's going to -- some of this is so hinged on an OEM, it's an OEM sell, we're targeting OEM with the software platform. So, they have adoption that they have to do and integration work on their end.
So, that makes me a little bit like I don't want folks like folding it into the model in the next quarter right, but we're trying to give a sense that we're already starting to preview the platform to get feedback and work that with customers.
The market is absolutely huge. There are a lot of players and software and IOT, but as I and my team have looked at the space, there are so many people that are small companies that you never heard of that are startup, that have got two customers and they don't have the IOT customer installed base that we have and frankly they don't even have all the resources that we have.
So, we have explicitly decided with MACH10 that we are going to go after OEM space. We're not trying to sell IOT software to end users. We think the OEMs need help. We think it's complex to develop IOT applications and manage their equipment in the field even as they get an Internet connection.
And so many of the solutions today help them get data connected from the device to the cloud but don't provide them the management application and the capability to securely let people get access and you make use of the data that's provided. So, we're not trying to go after the whole space. We understand where we hunt and where we play. We see it as a nice complement to our gateway solutions.
So, we think there's plenty of market opportunity, but it's still early yet for us to really forecast to you what we think can become and I think a bigger milestone is what do you guys actually doing to form a launch with pricing and availability and how do we think about what this might look like and we're not quite there yet.
But I think we're excited to point that we put this India organization together focused on IOT software. We've had people in our headquarters here in Irvine, focused on software and we just felt like it really was the time now that it's been nine months that we've been spending energy on this to start sharing more about the value proposition and what kind of problem we were solving.

Mark Spiegel
So, when are you doing the formal launch and then I assume OEMs are designing it into their products at that point, but you might not see revenue for a while. When do you start seeing some revenue from this thing? Is it a year from now or is it later this year?
Jeff Benck
I am really going to withhold predicting a time on it because it's going to depend so much on the OEM time runs. I can tell you that when I'm summer timeframe from an announcement standpoint and we want to make sure that we've got everything ticked and tied and we're ready to go, but that's kind of the timeframe we'll be able to give more clarity as to the complete solution and we have a better world coming up.
We'll be doing demos there of it as well. So, we'll start to get more visibility in engaging the community along with analysts and customers this the spring in the summer. So probably…
Mark Spiegel
So, this summer is the formal introduction and then want it takes a year to designing into a product? I am just looking for some ballpark idea here.
Jeff Benck
I believe we will have customers that are using it this calendar year. I am not going to forecast revenue, but I but see that we'll have customers that are engaged with us this year.
And if you think about the revenue, I think us being able to describe to you how many clients are working with us and that kind of stuff be meaningful because with a subscription-based solution, it's going to be revenue over time as you know right.
Mark Spiegel
Yes. All right. Thank you very much and again the work and the results are much appreciated. So, thank you.
Jeff Benck
Yes, no, thank you. Thanks for the question.

Welcome the Lantronix Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. And please do note that this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to E.E. Wang, please go ahead.
E.E. Wang
Thank you, William. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining the Lantronix fiscal 2017 third quarter conference call. Joining us on the call today are Jeff Benck, Lantronix President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeremy Whitaker, Lantronix Chief Financial Officer. A live and archived webcast of today's call will be available on the company's website at www.lantronix.com. In addition, a phone replay will be available starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific today, through May 4 by dialing (877) 344-7529 in the United States; or for international callers (412) 317-0888 and entering passcode 10105368. During this call, management may make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Lantronix' results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
We encourage you to review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the earnings release which was furnished to the SEC today and is available on our website and in the company's SEC filings such as its 10-K and 10-Q. Lantronix undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Also, please note that during this call, the company will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. Today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, describes the differences between our non-GAAP and GAAP reporting and presents reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures that we use. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Benck, President and CEO of Lantronix.
Jeffrey Benck
Thank you, E.E and welcome to everyone joining us for this afternoon's call. As you may have seen from our press release earlier today, we delivered another solid quarter of results. In the quarter ending March 31, we achieved $11.5 million in revenue, representing 16% year-over-year growth and also achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability. Contributing to our strong results in the quarter, our IT management business has shown consistent year-over-year growth driven by winning competitive bake-offs, closing and shipping some meaningful deals and expanding our channel engagement. 
Q3 was no exception, as these actions contributed to the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 100% year-over-year sales growth in the SOC 8000, our industry leading modular console manager. In addition, we continue to make progress in our IoT product line. Our IoT products also experienced strong year-over-year growth in Q3, primarily due to the strength in our wired Ethernet product family. 
On the strategic front, in February, we provided an early preview and demonstration of our MACH10 multidimensional IoT management software platform. The MACH10 technology is a key part of our strategy to move up the IoT value chain and we have been pleased with encouraging early feedback we have received from OEMs, partners, system integrators and analysts that we have engaged. 
Turning to our IoT gateways, last month, we previewed our new xPico 200 product family, the world's smart embedded IoT gateway, at the embedded world Conference in Nuremberg, Germany. The xPico 200 is another addition to our growing portfolio of wireless IoT gateways and we expect to start broadly sampling this product to OEM customers this quarter. 

Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we achieved with both our current product lines and with the new product initiatives that have the potential to significantly impact our long term growth. It's clear that we're moving in the right direction and we're committed to continuing to make the changes needed to drive sustainable growth and long term value for our shareholders. Before I provide some additional insight on our business, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeremy to discuss our financial results from the third quarter.
Jeremy Whitaker
Thank you, Jeff. Please refer to today's news release and the financial information in the Investor Relations section of our website for additional details that will supplement my financial commentary. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to go over our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As Jeff mentioned, net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $11.5 million, a 16% increase when compared with $10 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. And a 3% increase when compared with $11.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The growth was due to increased sales in both our IoT and IT management product lines. More specifically, our IoT product line increased by 14% year-over-year, primarily due to large production purchases of our export embedded Ethernet solution by two customers.
In addition, our ITM product line increased by 93%, primarily due to continued sales momentum from our SLC 8000 advanced console manager solution which benefited from a couple of large customer deployments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue was 55.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with 48% for the third quarter fiscal 2016 and 51.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The improvement from the year ago quarter was primarily due to product mix, as some of our higher-margin products, such as the SLC 8000 and export contributed to a larger portion of our net revenue.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $4.4 million compared with $3.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and $3.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The sequential increase in SG&A was primarily due to changes -- to charges in connection with restructuring of our EMEA sales organization and variable compensation. 
In addition, our marketing spend was up as we participated in 2 of our largest trade shows during the quarter. Our research and development expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $2.1 million compared with $1.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and $1.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a GAAP net loss of $162,000 or $0.01 per share which included a restructuring charge of $246,000. This compares to a GAAP net loss of 456,000 or $0.03 per share during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and GAAP net income of $41,000 or breakeven earnings per share during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. I am also pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of non-GAAP profitability, as we achieved non-GAAP net income of $484,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with non-GAAP net income of $189,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and non-GAAP net income of $444,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated positive cash flow from operating activities of $627,000 during the third quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $7.4 million as of March 31, 2017 compared with $6 million as of June 30, 2016. Net inventories as of March 31, 2017 were $7.7 million, essentially flat with the last quarter. Working capital increased to $9.9 million as of March 31, 2017 compared with $9.1 million as of June 30, 2016. 

In summary, we're pleased with the continued progress that we made this quarter. Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to maintain our gross margin above 50%. With respect to operating expenses, we expect spending to be down sequentially, although we plan to continue to invest for the longer term. I'll allow turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeffrey Benck
Thanks, Jeremy. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on the key initiatives that I laid out at the beginning of fiscal 2017, driving operational excellence to improve the financial results of our business, while also making room for investment in our growth initiatives; accelerating growth in our IT Management product line through DONs and market share gains and executing on our strategic product road map, including investing in new offerings to more broadly participate in the fast-growing IoT market.
First, let's review our progress on operational excellence. As I've discussed on previous calls over the past year, we have implemented a number of ongoing improvements throughout our organization, including product cost reductions, focused improvement in sales and marketing execution, better pricing discipline and closely managed spending. Our March quarter results which include 16% revenue growth, improved margins and $627,000 in cash generation clearly demonstrates the impact we could have on our business with consistent execution.
This progress is all that more striking when you consider that over the last year, we added or replaced more than half of our regional sales managers, initiated a leadership transition and restructuring in Europe and made a significant new investment in building an India-based IoT software development center. Our efforts to rebuild and strengthen our sales team in the Americas continue to pay dividends. The revitalization in our Americas sales organization has also helped to drive new opportunities and customer reengagement, resulting in more than a 30% year-over-year growth in the quarter.
As mentioned during our last call, we have been disappointed with our performance of our EMEA region. To address this issue, we took action to restructure our EMEA sales team, put in place a new leader, hired new sales managers to focus on specific product segments and reduced overhead costs for the purpose of reinvesting in additional sales resources in the region. You might have noticed from our filings that we took a onetime charge to complete this restructuring and it directly impacted our GAAP profitability in the quarter. While this transition may impact our near term results, we the expect actions we're taking now will improve our design-win performance and translate into long term growth in this key region.
At a corporate level, we were pleased to recruit an Intel IoT exec, Shahram Mehraban, to the Lantronix executive team as Vice President of Marketing during the quarter. Shahram brings IoT industry insights, business development skills and marketing leadership that will help to round out her team, including experience in building ecosystem partnerships and alliances which will be important as we engage in more IoT deployments with our OEM customers. 
Turning to our second initiative. We achieved 93% year-over-year growth in our IT Management business, as we continue to gain share through competitive takeouts, effective marketing and improved channel engagement. For the fourth quarter in a row, an SLC 8000 revenues grew by more than 100% year-over-year. The growth and increased visibility of our SLC 8000 flagship product has also contributed to increased interest in our other ITM products.
The results from our IT Management sales and marketing efforts have also attracted new channel partnerships. Last week we announced the addition of Connector Systems, a division of Ingram Micro, as our New Zealand distributor and Rahi Systems as a new reseller of our IT Management products in India. Since the launching our new SmartAdvantage program last August, we have attracted more than 35 new resellers worldwide, who, today, are promoting Lantronix IT management and IoT device gateway solutions. 

Turning to our IoT efforts. We have continued to execute on our strategic product development plan. As I've stated before, our mission is to deliver secure data access and management solutions that make it easier for companies to access the benefits of the Internet of Things. Over the past year, I've talked several times about our focus on defining new technologies that will help companies simplify their IoT deployment efforts and expand our solutions beyond just hardware. In line with this vision, in January, we took a major step with the announcement that we were developing MACH10, a new IoT management software platform. This OEM centric platform leverages Lantronix' more than 25 years of first-hand experience as an IoT hardware and embedded software provider to thousands of OEMs and has been architected from the ground-up to address the gaps we see in the marketplace. 
Today, most IoT platforms provides infrastructure to move data between the device and cloud, leaving the complexity of building applications around the data to the OEM. MACH10 starts where other IoT platforms stop by enabling OEMs to quickly and profitably deliver web scale IoT applications and services. In March, we provided an early preview of this new platform at embedded world and we have already started demonstrating the platform with select IoT customers and industry analysts. The early feedback has been positive and we intend to have more customers working with the platform as we continue our development. We expect to formally launch the first release later this calendar year.
As some of you may recall, we've talked previously about how we're in the business of delivering IoT Gateway solutions. Today, there is often a lot of confusion around the different options that OEMs have for developing their smart connected products. Many IoT solutions, such as chips and modules appear to be cheaper but require extensive added investments in time, certification and engineering resources to deliver a complete IoT solution. Lantronix has long been known for delivering robust connectivity solutions and with our new IoT gateways, we're focusing on providing additional functionality and features that allows OEMs to further accelerate their IoT deployments.
During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on this front with the preview of our new xPico 200 product family, the industry's smallest embedded IoT gateways. Along with the FCX 5150 and PremierWave 2050, the xPico 200 family has targeted OEMs seeking to jump start their development of smarter connected devices by providing robust wireless connectivity, enterprise-level security, industrial grade design and integrated IoT management software powered by MACH10. The xPico 200 family will be another addition to the Lantronix growing portfolio of wireless IoT Gateway solutions. And we expect to start sampling this embedded solution with OEM customers later this quarter.
Now let me wrap up. I am pleased with the results we achieved in the quarter. Our team continues to push full speed ahead as we move toward the end of our current fiscal year and plan for the start of fiscal year 2018. While we have a lot more to accomplish, we're 100% aligned, committed and fully believe that our plan is one that will allow us to win in the marketplace and achieve greater value for our shareholders. With that, I complete our prepared remarks for today. So at this point, I'll turn it over to the operator to initiate our question and answer session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And it looks like our first questioner today is going to be Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital Markets.
Jaeson Schmidt
Just want to start on the IT Management side. You guys have obviously, had great success with the SLC 8000 product, can you give us a sense of where you think your market share currently is and potentially we're you could grow that to longer term in that space?

Jeffrey Benck
Yes. Sure Jason. This is Jeff. We -- this is an area that -- we've spent a little bit of time with the analyst community and it's not well tracked, even though it's more than a $100 million market that we know just from looking at that the competitor filings. We believe that we're in a single-digit share position. Obviously, with the growth that we've experienced, we can firmly and confidently say we gained share, but we still believe that we're in the single-digit range.
So even though this market is a mature market, not growing really fast, we believe there's growth opportunity for us because we have a great offering and we've been pretty focused on that segment. We also are seeing some new opportunities in like development environments where a technology company might use our console management to develop a new storage controller or a new switch that they plan to bring to market and that's kind of interesting because there seems to be some growth opportunity in that subsegment of this space. But that's kind of our view at this point, that we still have plenty of opportunity for share gain going forward.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking at MACH10, do you anticipate needing to continue to pour in any investment on that front or I assume most of the heavy lifting has already been done?
Jeffrey Benck
Yes. We're pretty far into the development as you might expect, being able to get to both the demo that we did at embedded world and some of the engagement we've had with customers and analysts. We're still in development. We still have more work to do. We have increased our investment in the team in India. So we have continued to add resources to our software lab that we initiated there just about a year ago. We also have continued to do some select hiring in the U.S. as well, supporting that team.
We added a Director of Engineering in the U.S. to further help that. We've been able to -- really been able to accommodate that within our -- within the spend that you see. And we don't see that -- a material change there, but we will continue to invest as we go forward and engage more customers and develop more applications. But I'm pleased that we've been able to put what's been a rather significant effort within the plan. And it was part of the restructuring we did almost a year ago to kind of give us room to put additional investment in. But that's kind of where we're right now.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. And just going off that, I know it seems like there were a few kind of one-time in nature expenses in the March quarter and you expect OpEx to decline in June. Jeremy, can you give a sense of how severe that decline will be? Are we talking more towards that December quarter OpEx level?
Jeremy Whitaker
Yes. So in the quarter we just reported, they is about $246,000 charge related to the restructuring that we did in Europe. In addition, it is a kind of heavy trade show quarter for us, so marketing expenses were up compared to where they were in the previous quarter. And going into next quarter, we would to expect some of those marketing costs to come down as it's a more normal quarter. So I don't necessarily think it's a severe decline in spending but definitely a small decrease.
Jaeson Schmidt
Okay. And then the last one for me and I will jump back into Q1. Can you just talk about your general visibility, where it is today compared to 3 months ago? Have you seen any improvement? And kind of how we should think about the outlook, bigger picture, for the year?
Jeffrey Benck
Yes. Visibility, we've tried to put a lot of effort into our forecasts and the forecast methodology and I feel like over the course of the year, we've improved in terms of understanding our customers that we sell to and engage with, but we still sell quite a bit through the channel and our IoT products go through two-tier distribution, so that sometimes blurs things for us. We feel pretty good about the execution that we've had.

We've got a number of opportunities that we can continue to pursue. Having put up a couple of quarters of growth, when we look at the full year, we feel pretty confident that this looks to be a growth year for us. We've been kind of hesitant to look out too much further in terms of what we might guide. But we're just kind of heads down focused on educating the plan that we laid out and demonstrating that we can gain share getting design wins for our IoT product lines and bringing MACH10 to market. 
And that's a bit of a wildcard for us because it's obviously not in the plan yet. And it will take some time but we're excited that we've been able to contain the investment in that brand-new platform within our profile as you see represented here. So that's kind of -- that's about as far as I'm willing to go today. But I'm generally feeling pretty good about the business.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. There look to be no further questions, so this will conclude our question and answer session.
Jeffrey Benck
Thank you, William. At this point, we'll look forward to updating you on our progress, achievements and actions when we report out our full-year results in late August. And with that, we'll conclude the call for today. Thank you for attending.
