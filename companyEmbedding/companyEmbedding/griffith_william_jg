R Sategnaon August 24, 2012Format: VHS Tape|Verified PurchaseI just bought this movie on VHS recently.  This a great movie, has a lot of great actors--Sam Elloitt and Farah Facett and Katherine Ross.  Although it is from the seventies it still holds up and I question why it is not available on DVD.  It should be.  It is a TV movie but it is really a great one.  I know it would sell on DVD --needs exposure.  While you can, purchase it on VHS---well worth it.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsTake TWOByTundraBeeon August 12, 2006Format: VHS Tape|Verified PurchaseTHERE ARE *TWO* I SAID 2, VHS TAPES CONSTITUTING THIS 1981 MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE about Houston's Hill murders. The listing here says "Number of tapes: 1" - that is wrong. Make sure you get both tapes. This viewer finished reading Thomas Thompson's "Blood and Money" and was all settled in my armchair having a cozy time watching a Movie that was better than the book when ...IT STOPPEDand the criminal investigation hadn't even started!There are TWO tapes, and my seller sold one. I had to wait a whole `nother week.Young Sam Elliott, alone, as the creepy Dr. Hill, is well worth the price of the set.But wait!There's More!Farrah Fawcett, Katherine Ross, Andy Griffith, and Craig T. Nelson also populate  this well-written screenplay with people prettier than the photos I've seen of the actual participants. There are some stunning cuts and juxtapositions - as when we watch the lid of Joan's exhumed casket being opened and then see Kurth/Ross in a similarly shaped bubble bathtub. The movie is kind to Kurth (the object of John Hill's adulterous affection) as it is based on *her* book (not Thompson's tedious tome.)This gem needs to be released on DVD - to prevent another catastrophe as befell this reviewer, and to include news footage and updates./TundraVision, Amazon ReviewerRead more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsWhere's the Bloody DVD ??ByPeter T. Wolfon February 18, 2012Format: VHS TapeThe fact that this has not been released on DVD is one of those movie industry mysteries. Much like why no DVD for '55 Days at Peking' or 'The Prize'.  When I saw 'Murder in Texas' on TV 30 years ago I realized I was watching something exceptional. And what set it apart was the gripping performance of one of this country's  finest actors; Sam Elliott. The evil that penetrates through his chilling stares and menacing tone. The scene in the speeding car where, in his drug induced hallucination, he unknowingly replays the murder of his wife (Farah Fawcett) to a terrified Katherine Ross. Amazing acting.  Then there's Andy Griffith, also one of our finest actors, giving a dynamite performance as the heart broken  father of Fawcett, seething with revenge and hatred for Elliott.When and if this comes out on DVD, I'm buying it instantly.Read more11 comment|

I have been checking monthly since the talented Farrah Fawcett passed away for it to come out on DVD. I don't understand it...this was a huge true crime story and actually the first acting job Farrah had (I believe but not 100% sure) after Charlie's Angels that actually showed she could ACT...Sam Elliott and Katherine Ross are divine as always...The story is compelling and shocking even in this day and age...just can't imagine what is preventing its release on DVD.Read more44 comments|

We became obsessed with it. Rode by Joan Hills house and Ash Robinson's in River Oaks.  Went to the Avalon Drugstore where Joan shopped.  I am a horse  trainer and the fact that she was involved with horses made it more real to  me!  We are planning to go to Houston soon and visit her grave and bring  flowers.  May Joan Hill rest in Peace and where is John Hill anyhow?Read more11 comment|
