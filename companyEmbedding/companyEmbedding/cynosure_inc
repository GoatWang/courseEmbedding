Medical Devices Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Medical devices are durable and disposable in nature.

It can be as simple as a tongue depressor, medical thermometer or disposable gloves.  It can also be as complex as a computer which can assist in medical testing, an implant like a stent or a prosthesis.  Globally, the medical device market is over $209 billion.  
 Medical devices are classified in one of three regulatory classes, the classification is dependent on the intended use of the device and indications for use.  The US accounts for approximately 38% of the global medical device market.  China, Japan, Russia and Brazil have the most stringent regulatory compliance for medical devices.
