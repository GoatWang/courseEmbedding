Noranda Aluminum Holding Corp., parent company of Noranda Aluminum in Gramercy, filed Monday (Feb. 8) for voluntary bankruptcy protection in federal court. It filed under Chapter 11 rules that would let it restructure its business operations.
The company said it will continue to operate its Gramercy refinery but will would no longer be shipping the Gramercy refinery's product to the company's New Madrid, Mo., aluminum smelter. The change will require the company to find another buyer for its alumina, "along with achieving additional cost reductions and maintaining the company's bauxite business as a secure source of supply."

Noranda bankruptcy filing information

Part of the plan includes completion of a construction project doubling the Gramercy plant's manufacturing capacity for non-metallurgical or chemical-grade alumina by March 2016. The Noranda campus straddles the St. John the Baptist-St. James parish line.
Documents posted on the company's website said Noranda has already entered into agreements with existing lenders for as much as $165 million in new financing. "We are seeking court authority on an immediate basis to continue paying employee wages and providing health care benefits without interruption," said a note for employees on the company's web site. "As with every part of our business, our benefit programs are under review. If any changes are made that affect you, you will be notified in a timely manner."
Noranda takes bauxite, a mineral mined in Jamaica and transported by ships to Gramercy, mixes it with caustic soda and heats it under pressure to produce a white powder called alumina. Until now, the alumina has been shipped to New Madrid, where it was smelted into aluminum.
In January, Noranda executives warned Louisiana officials they might shut down the Gramercy plant. They cited sagging commodity prices and a dispute with the government of Jamaica over the fee that the company pays to export bauxite. The closure could lead to the loss of 444 jobs, officials said, but there was no mention of immediate layoffs or cutbacks on its web site on Monday.
Noranda Aluminum in Gramercy to be sued over mercury emissions
Earlier this month, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network sent Noranda's Gramercy subsidary a "notice of intent to sue" letter charging the plant and its previous owner, Kaiser Aluminum, with violating federal and state hazardous waste laws by allowing the release of mercury from its operations in amounts that could harm human health and wildlife. It's unclear what effect Monday's bankruptcy filing will have on that proposed lawsuit.
Story corrected to show that expansion now under way is for portion of plant manufacturing  non-metallurgical or chemical-grade alumina.

“We have a simple strategy,” Noranda Aluminum Holding Corp. CEO Kip Smith says. “We want to make each pound of aluminum at the lowest possible cost, and sell it for the highest premium available in the market.”
Smith, who became Noranda’s CEO in March 2008, says its strategy is tightly wrapped around three tactical choices. First are the company’s integrated, strategically located, globally competitive assets in the United States and Jamaica.
Second is its passionate focus on productivity. And third is a goal to sell every pound of aluminum as a value-added product.
Geography Strategy
“We are integrated from red dirt to aluminum foil,” Smith says, summarizing the scope of operations that Noranda divides into two businesses. The company’s upstream business produces 13 percent of the primary aluminum consumed in the United States. Its downstream business is a leading producer of aluminum foil and light-gauge aluminum sheet in rolling mill facilities located in Tennessee, North Carolina and Arkansas.
Noranda’s bauxite mining operation in Jamaica is the closest source of bauxite to the mouth of the Mississippi River, near the company’s alumina refining operation in Gramercy, La. Alumina travels by barge from Gramercy to Noranda’s aluminum smelter in New Madrid, Mo.
Across its integrated business, more than 95 percent of Noranda’s products are delivered into the United States. More than 75 percent of its primary aluminum volume is delivered to customers within a one-day truck delivery distance, and in the downstream business that number is close to 65 percent.
“Our United States and Jamaican geography is important to our integrated strategy,” Smith says. “The proximity of our assets to one another supports productivity, and their proximity to our customers supports our value-added sales strategy.”
Smith added that the company’s location also provides proximity to the sources of supply for many of the key raw materials which are not integrated. These include carbon-based and chemical products, and natural gas, where the company enjoys good relationships with industry-leading suppliers.
A Passion For Productivity
Though confessing that he doesn’t like to think about the fact that 35 years have passed since he graduated from university, Smith acknowledges he has learned many lessons through his experience across numerous commodity cycles.
One of those lessons is the importance of having a secure supply of key raw materials. Another is the value of instilling a strong productivity mindset throughout an organization. “We are integrated in the upstream business for security of supply and a broader ability to influence our costs,” Smith says.
“We have a passion for productivity,” Smith declares. The company uses its CORE program (“Cost Out, Reliability and Effectiveness”) to channel that passion into a project-based framework to control costs, de-bottleneck capacity constraints and improve reliability at the company’s production facilities.
According to Smith, Noranda’s CORE projects fall into three broad categories. The first is the do-it-better category – small-scope process changes that require little or no capital. For example, smelter engineers recently increased the size of the anodes in one of the smelters three pot lines from 61 inches to 63 inches. This change required essentially no capital, just experimentation, process modification and great teamwork. The benefit was reduced voltage, increased amperage and $1 million in annualized savings.
Second is the better-tools category – projects requiring modest capital, and provide employees with additional tools to either drive out costs or improve operational reliability and effectiveness. In one of its rolling mill facilities, for example, the company recently installed an internally developed graphite-spray system where a team of engineers and equipment operators came up with the idea and aided in the design. The new system improved quality, improved reliability and reduced graphite usage, generating more than $100,000 of savings in its first quarter of operations.
Third are major projects that require meaningful capital and extend over several quarters or years. As an example, Smith describes a $2.5 million project to replace a piece of equipment that slits larger pieces of foil to allow for processing into thinner material. This slitter project allowed that facility to meet the needs of certain product groups, which it previously could not serve in a cost-effective manner.
Smith also cites a $38 million investment at the smelter as an example of the company’s commitment to productivity. During late 2010, Noranda re-launched a project at the New Madrid smelter to improve operating reliability and to expand aluminum production capacity by approximately 35 million pounds.
With a remaining cost of $38 million at the time it was re-launched, the project involves a combination of additional rectifiers and upgraded equipment, allowing for increased amperage and more efficient utilization of electricity. These efficiency gains are particularly important for the company because electricity is typically the largest individual cost in producing aluminum.
Winning with Winners
Although a basic output of any aluminum smelter is a product known as commodity grade ingot, Noranda has production capabilities that allow it to add alloys to the metal and fabricate it into different shapes. These shapes, which Noranda refers to as value-added product, are sold at a premium to the commodity grade aluminum price.
“We strive to sell every pound of primary aluminum as a value-added product,” says Smith. “We make this choice not only to earn additional margins, but also because it strengthens our ties to the consumer market.”
These value-added products come in several forms. In the primary aluminum segment, the two mainstay products are extrusion billet and redraw rod. Noranda enjoys a meaningful share of the U.S. market for these two products, supplying approximately 29 percent of the redraw rod and 13 percent of the extrusion billet produced in North American primary smelter casthouses.
Extrusion billet is shipped by Noranda in a form that looks like an aluminum log. Customers soften the billet in their own production processes and form the metal into desired shapes.
Noranda also produces redraw rod in 5,000-pound coils. Noranda’s customers employ that redraw rod in the manufacture of electrical wire and various types of cable. “Aluminum is the preferred material for high-voltage transmission wire,” Smith explains.
In July 2012, Noranda announced plans to move forward on a $45 million investment to build a new rod mill. That project includes infrastructure development and construction of a new mill to produce redraw rod. The company expects spending on the project to begin in 2013, and full production to be realized in 2015.
Noranda’s downstream operations, Smith notes, manufacture aluminum foil and light-gauge aluminum sheet. These products include heavy gauge foil products such as fin-stock, which is used in the manufacture of HVAC equipment, or semi-rigid container stock, which are used in pans for cooking. The downstream product line also includes household aluminum foil and other light gauge foils used in consumer products packaging, as well as light-gauge sheet products employed in transformer windings and building products.
Referring to a philosophy the company refers to as “winning with winners,” Smith says, “Our growth is led by the quality of our customer base – customers who are well positioned to grow because they are leaders in their respective industries.
“We enjoy a strong portfolio of growth opportunities in large part because of our strong customer relationships,” Smith says. He explains that Noranda’s operations and sales teams have built these relationships over years, and in some cases, over decades.
Smith sees a variety of growth opportunities in the United States and Jamaica – not only for Noranda, but also for the aluminum industry and U.S. manufacturing as a whole.
“Primary aluminum is adaptable to a universe of applications because of its metallurgical properties and environmentally friendly attributes,” Smith says, noting that these properties include its light weight and its recyclability. “Aluminum is essentially infinitely recyclable, with no loss in quality – ever.
“The focus on energy productivity in the U.S. helps align us with one of the catalytic trends for the manufacturing market today,” he says. As an example of how aluminum is both driving and benefiting from these trends related to energy productivity, Smith points to developments in the automotive industry, where the amount of aluminum per vehicle has increased in recent years.
Likewise, Smith points to how in the field of electricity conductors new power cable designs employ significantly more aluminum per cable foot. “We are bullish about aluminum demand both in the near-term and the long-term,” Smith says.
Smith is not only bullish about aluminum demand. He’s also optimistic about the future of manufacturing in the regions where Noranda operates and about the role that aluminum can play in that future.
“There is this idea that ‘nothing is made in America anymore,’” Smith says, “and that all our manufacturing jobs have vanished.” While acknowledging that over the last six decades, U.S. manufacturing has been declining relative to the overall economy, he attributes this decline more to rapid growth in other sectors such as services, than to an irreversible decline in U.S. manufacturing.
“I believe that sentiment is overblown,” he declares, citing data from a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report that shows that the United States manufacturing sector is equivalent to the ninth-largest economy in the world.
Smith believes there are five ingredients necessary for this resurgence: a productive workforce; available cost competitive power; a constructive, consistent and interactive regulatory environment; a national infrastructure that supports the physical needs of manufacturing commerce; and a society that prizes manufacturing as a foundation for a vibrant economy.
“If you look at the five most productive countries in the world,” Smith explains, “the United States is in the top five. The United States is a great place to manufacture.”
Although Noranda became a standalone company in 2007, the company’s roots extend back several decades. For example, the New Madrid smelter recently celebrated its 40th anniversary of operations.
Starting as a small subsidiary of a metals and mining conglomerate, Smith says the company had quality assets, an engaged work force and long-standing relationships with customers. But Smith says that to remain viable in a globally competitive market, and to thrive as an independent company, Noranda needed to change.
“Our actions to reposition and strengthen Noranda were done with a disciplined focus to do the right things, the right way and to get the results,” says Smith referring to what he calls Noranda’s “Two Number One Priorities.”
“We want a company that not only achieves financial success in the short-term, but will also be here in 100 years – to provide high quality manufacturing jobs for several generations to come,” Smith says. “It’s really all about making Noranda the company we always wanted to work for. We have 2,500 families that depend on us getting it right.”
That 100-year horizon was on display with banners hung in each facility in May 2012 as part of celebrating Noranda’s fifth anniversary as a stand-alone company.
“[The banners] said, ‘Five years and counting – only 95 to go,’” Smith says. “Someone asked me ‘What happens after 100 years?’” Smith recalls. “I said, ‘That’s phase two.’”

On February 8, 2016, Noranda Aluminum Holding Corporation and all of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to initiate a court supervised process under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

On February 8, 2016, Noranda Aluminum Holding Corporation and all of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to initiate a court supervised process under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Noranda has taken this action to have additional time and flexibility to evaluate options for our various business operations.
The cases are pending before the Honorable Barry S. Schermer, and the Debtors' cases are jointly administered under Case No. 16-10083.
On December 29, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order closing the Debtors' chapter 11 cases.
