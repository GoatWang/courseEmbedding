The Trident Funds
Stone Point Capital manages the Trident Funds and is currently investing its seventh fund, Trident VII, L.P., which has approximately $5.55 billion of committed capital. Prior funds include Trident VI, L.P., a $4.5 billion fund raised in 2014, Trident V, a $3.5 billion fund raised in 2010; Trident IV, a $2.25 billion fund raised in 2007; Trident III, a $1.1 billion fund raised in 2004; Trident II, a $1.4 billion fund raised in 1999; and The Trident Partnership, a $667 million fund raised in 1994.
We generally target equity investments of between $50 million and $400 million, but have the ability to make smaller and significantly larger investments.  We typically seek control or substantial minority positions in our portfolio companies, with board representation and customary shareholder rights.
