Silver Lake - Overview





                    Overview

Silver Lake is the global leader in technology investing, with about $39 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a team of approximately 100 investment and value creation professionals located around the world. Dedicated to the thesis that the dynamism and rapid pace of innovation in global technology demand intensely focused domain expertise, Silver Lake differentiates itself from generalist investment firms by devoting its full scope of talent and intellectual capital to the singular mission of investing in the world’s leading technology companies and tech-enabled businesses. Applying the strategic insights of an experienced industry participant, the operating skill of a world-class management team, and the investing capabilities of a leading private equity firm, Silver Lake leverages the deep knowledge and expertise of a global team based in Silicon Valley, New York, London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.
Unparalleled Technology Sector Expertise
Applying an analytically rigorous and data-focused approach, Silver Lake invests strategically and selectively across the broad value chain and sub-verticals of the technology industry, from semiconductors, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure to tech-enabled financial markets, transaction processing, mobile communications, and e-commerce.   
Launched in 1999 as a specialist firm focused on private technology company investments, Silver Lake has maintained its strategic discipline since its founding but has expanded its sector expertise to encompass four primary investment strategies:

Silver Lake Partners (SLP) invests in large-cap technology companies and tech-enabled businesses.
Silver Lake Sumeru invests in middle market technology companies and tech-enabled businesses.
Silver Lake Waterman provides growth capital to later-stage companies in the technology and technology-enabled industries, offering flexible solutions to finance expansion and acquisitions.
Silver Lake Kraftwerk provides growth capital to technology and tech-enabled businesses driving efficiency across the operations, energy, and resources industries.

Investing in Market Leaders Positioned for Dynamic Growth
Leveraging a deep network of relationships throughout the global technology industry, Silver Lake seeks to cultivate proprietary or specialized investment opportunities not typically available to generalist investors. Silver Lake’s ideal target company has a leading position in its market, a competitively advantaged business model, a strong management team, proprietary core technologies, sound business processes, and the potential for transformational value creation. The firm seeks to formulate its investments to enable growth and frequently employs conservative capital structures designed to drive aggressive investment in new initiatives, innovation, and business expansion. Today Silver Lake’s portfolio of investments collectively generates more than $142 billion of revenue annually and employs more than 300,000 people globally.
Partnership with Premier Management Teams
Partnering with proven leaders drawn from across the global technology industry and tech-enabled businesses, Silver Lake and its portfolio company management teams work in concert to establish and sustain differentiated competitive advantage in their respective markets. Seeking to capitalize on innovative or disruptive business models, Silver Lake and its management partners aim to achieve performance metrics that are not dependent on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Silver Lake believes that its portfolio companies interact with nearly every sizeable participant in the technology value chain, providing access, relationships, and insights across all sub-sectors of their opportunity set.
Value Creation Driven Through Strategic and Operational Discipline
Building upon a commitment to enhance the operational performance of its portfolio companies that has been a hallmark of the firm since its inception, Silver Lake has built a dedicated value creation team with extensive operating experience around the world, including professionals drawn from some of the largest and most successful companies in the global technology industry. The value creation and investment teams work collaboratively with Silver Lake’s portfolio companies to introduce new products and services, enter new global markets, launch new strategic partnerships, and expand the international network of relationships available to management. The value creation team also works closely with Silver Lake’s investment professionals to assist in the due diligence and evaluation of prospective investment opportunities, offering deep knowledge of a specific sub-sector or technology. Silver Lake believes its value creation initiatives have been essential drivers of past performance and will remain central to its differentiated, specialist investment strategy.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Silverlake Digital Economy Operating System (SDE.OS)

                        
                    




In the last decade, the digitalisation of economic functions has penetrated all traditional businesses and fundamentally changed the way business is done.

Leading to today’s frontier in cyberspace is the amalgamation of traditionally separate economic spaces within an enterprise, across enterprises and across industries.
This creation of value through collaboration, integration and harnessing of the collective will drive the evolution of the Digital Economy. New economic spaces will be formed while traditional one fade in cyberspace. Within this commercial backdrop, software systems need to adapt to the new driving forces. New challenges for software systems require new methods.
Silverlake has addressed this unfolding situation through its software product SDE.OS – a system software that enables all manner of business applications to partake in the Digital Economy. SDE.OS contains Silverlake's technology which addresses the single most important factor in the Digital Economy – creating value out of any collective consistently, methodically and in sustainable manner.
Fundamental to harnessing collectives for economic value in the Digital Economy is solving the problem of complexity in systems due to simple permutation of the number of distinct elements in the collective. Systems are knowledge-based; permutations give rise to aggregated knowledge, a situation which lacks a formal method in our traditional way of working with systems. In fact, our traditional methods are clearly unable to deal with the complexities that come with such system permutations and their different knowledge base.
SIlverlake's SDE.OS addresses this fundamental by removing the need for traditional methods, and introducing a completely new means for working with collective knowledge – transcending the single biggest challenge most commercial Digital Economy initiatives face.
