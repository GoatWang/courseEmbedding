	The Canfor History Is A Story Spanning From The 1930s To Now






































 Our Founders Mid 1900's Late 1900's Early 2000's Today    Our Rich History Canfor is a story of people; about how two entrepreneurs created an enterprise that grew from a modest beginning to become one of Canada's major forest products companies. The company traces its roots to the late 1930s, when brothers-in-law John G. Prentice and L.L.G. "Poldi" Bentley and their families left their native Austria as the clouds of war gathered over Europe. Explore our history: Scroll down      Canfor  Canfor Pulp  New South  Scotch Gulf  Beadles & Balfour  ALL          1888 Creation of Virgin Pine Lumber  Scotch Lumber Company is the oldest wood products company in Clarke County, Alabama. In 1888, Marcus B. Berhman and Joseph Zimmerman establish Virgin Pine Lumber Co. at Wade’s Station, Alabama (later called Behrman).       1889 Scotch Lumber Co. Ltd. Dr. Alexander McTaggart of Park Hill, Ontario, buys Virgin Pine Lumber and sells a one-third interest a year later to Charles Norman Spencer. William Spencer (relationship to Charles unknown) moves to Alabama where he and McTaggart form a partnership under the name Scotch Lumber Co. Ltd. in honour of their Scottish heritage.       1886 Change Community Name George R. Hannon and others from New York State purchase Scotch Lumber and change the name of the community from Behrman to Fulton after their hometown in New York.       1900 May Lumber Company Ben May, a businessman born in Atlanta in 1889, founds the May Lumber Company with his brother. May Lumber acquires cut-over timber properties with the aim of reforesting them – an innovative idea in the early 1900s. May Lumber provides free dunnage for shipping companies taking cargo to Europe during the First World War on the condition that the company owns the lumber once the ship is unloaded. Since the lumber is considered used, it avoids the high tariffs for lumber entering European ports and is sold at a considerable profit.       1902 Scotch Lumber Changes Ownership Two Wisconsin residents – William D. Harrigan and Fredrick Herrick – buy Scotch Lumber, its land holdings and its logging railroad operation, the Alabama and Tombigbee Railroad Company. They later buy large tracts of land from the Sage Land Company. Descendants of Harrigan and related families would own and operate the company for the next 107 years. William Harrigan wants his employees to enjoy the best conveniences so he builds the first good road to the local county seat at Grove Hill, establishes station telephone service, installs a water pump house and water well, and provides rental houses and a commissary for groceries and other supplies. He even builds Clarke County’s first four-hole golf course, swimming hole and motion picture theatre.       1920 Company Buys Timberlands Ben May is invited to invest in land in southwest Alabama to form a hunting preserve with his long-time friend Fred Stimpson. He buys the tract to produce timber, and gives Stimpson life-long hunting rights and part ownership in return for managing the property. The company also buys timberlands in Alabama, Florida and California.       1930 Fulton Sawmill Burns Scotch Lumber’s Fulton sawmill burns. The company, struggling to survive during the Depression, decides not to reopen the mill. Small peckerwood sawmills continue to operate in Scotch’s forests, and in 1938 a new sawmill is built.     1930 Start of Beadles Lumber Company Clarence V. Beadles, who worked at a small planer mill in Coffeeville in Northern Mississippi purchased the mill. With better timber resources located further south, Beadles moved the mill to Toomsuba, Mississippi.        1935 Start of Balfour Lumber Company Balfour Lumber Company begins as a division of Georgia Crate and Basket Company. The Crate Company had started a selective harvesting program for their hardwood logs and opens the sawmill division to do the same thing with pine logs from local plantations. The sawmill originally produced long timbers but expanded into framing and boards as the demand for wood products expanded.        1938 Pacific Veneer Only months after settling in Vancouver, John Prentice and Poldi Bentley form a furniture and paneling veneer company calling it Pacific Veneer. They build a small mill, which employs 28 people, on the banks of the Fraser River in New Westminster, B.C. In 1939, Pacific Veneer becomes a supplier of plywood for aviation and marine applications, as well as Douglas fir plywood and the mill soon employs 1,000 men and women. The two men lay the foundation for a business that could grow. And they have already begun to integrate their operations, creating a company that could rely on its own internal strengths.          1940 EBURNE SAW MILLS LIMITED In 1940, they buy Eburne Saw Mills Limited, located near the mouth of the Fraser River, and upgrade and convert it to cut hemlock and balsam. With the Eburne purchase, the company becomes a shareholder in Seaboard Lumber Sales Ltd., a Vancouver-based wood products marketing and shipping consortium. Seaboard gives the company better access to important offshore markets at competitive freight rates.     1940 Start of Gulf Lumber Ben May founds and becomes president of Gulf Lumber Company in Mobile, Alabama. He converts a cooperage plant into a lumber concentration yard that evolves into a sawmill. The mill produces lumber needed during the Second World War.         1943 Harrison Operations In 1943, they purchase four or five small logging operations in the Fraser Valley.        1944 Englewood Logging Division The drive to secure a stable log supply continues with the purchase of timber rights in the Nimpkish Valley on Vancouver Island in 1944, which becomes the Englewood Logging Division.        1947 Company Renamed Included in the Nimpkish purchase is a small firm called Canadian Forest Products Limited, a name that strikes a chord with John Prentice and Poldi Bentley. In 1947, they reorganize all their operations under that name.        1948 Huntting-Merritt With the purchase of Huntting-Merritt in 1948, which together with Stave Lake Cedar, makes the company the largest red cedar shingle and shake producer. Also in 1948, Panel and Fibre starts production of hardboard made from residuals.       1948 Beadles Lumber moves to Moultrie, Georgia        1951 Pulp Mill Acquired at Port Mellon Canfor moves into the pulp business by acquiring a small unbleached Kraft pulp mill owned by Howe Sound Pulp Company Limited. The mill, at Port Mellon on Howe Sound north of Vancouver, is closed when it is acquired, and is steadily expanded and upgraded to produce bleached pulp. Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Limited incorporates on March 29, 1988 as a 50/50 joint venture company between Canfor Corporation and Oji Paper Co., Ltd. of Japan.       1952 Stimpson Brothers Join Gulf Lumber Ben May hires brothers Billy, Ben and Gordon Stimpson to operate the Gulf Lumber mill.        1955 North Canadian Forest Industries Limited In 1955, Canfor purchases 50 per cent of Northern Plywood Ltd. in Grande Prairie, Alberta. The other 50 per cent is purchased later, along with several other bush mills in the area. They are now consolidated into our Grande Prairie Logging Division.       1956 C. Victor Beadles Succeeds Father After graduation from Georgia Tech, Clarence Beadles' son, C. Victor Beadles, takes over the mill.       1957 New South Roots Start in Conway New South has deep roots in the lumber industry of the south. The Wall, Sledge, Singleton, and Campbell families all joined together with their diverse backgrounds in the forest products business to build a sawmill near Conway, SC in 1957.        1962 CFP Awarded Pulp Wood Agreement In 1962, CFP gains a pulp wood agreement in the Prince George Area. This leads to a joint venture with Reed Paper Group Limited of the U.K. to create Prince George Pulp and Paper.        1963 Chetwynd Division The company expands into the northern British Columbia interior in 1963, purchasing several sawmills and planer mills in the Peace River District including the timber rights and mills of the Fort St. John Lumber Company. These holdings are consolidated into the company's Chetwynd Division the following year.        1965 Prince George Pulp and Paper In 1962, a joint venture with Reed Paper Group Limited of the U.K. leads to the start-up of Prince George Pulp and Paper in 1965.         1966 R.C. Balfour, III Purchases Sawmill R.C. Balfour, III purchases the sawmill operations from his father.        1968 Intercontinental Pulp Company Another joint venture with Reed and Feldmuehle AG of Germany creates Intercontinental Pulp Company Ltd., which starts up in 1968. Prince George Pulp and Paper and Intercontinental Pulp are now wholly owned by Canfor Corporation.      1968 Gulf Lumber Sells Land Gulf Lumber sells 50,000 acres in Florida to International Paper.        1970 Expansion The Hines Creek mill in Alberta is built in 1969 and production begins in early 1970.       1970 New South Forest Industries In the early 1970s, several lumber manufacturing companies in the southern United States form New South Forest Industries.       1972 Stimpson Brothers Buy Gulf Lumber Mill Ben May dies, and the Stimpson brothers buy the Gulf Lumber mill in Mobile.        1973 Westcoast Cellufibre Canfor acquires a majority interest in Westcoast Cellufibre Industries Ltd., a supplier of chips to Howe Sound Pulp mill, in 1973. Westcoast Cellufibre is now a division of Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Limited.        1975 Peter Bentley Peter Bentley, who has worked in a variety of positions for more than 20 years, becomes President in 1975, and later becomes Chairman and CEO in 1985. He is now the Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Directors.          1981 Fort St. John An important expansion in the north occurs in 1981 when the company acquires Swanson Lumber Co. Ltd., which has major sawmills and woodlands operations in High Level, Alberta and Fort St. John, B.C.        1983 Canfor Corporation On June 27, 1983 Canfor Corporation becomes a public company.

          Statement regarding shortlisting for West Coast Partnership rail franchise competition
        

22 Jun 2017
First Trenitalia West Coast Rail Limited, the partnership between FirstGroup plc (‘FirstGroup’) and Trenitalia UK Limited (‘Trenitalia’), has today been shortlisted by the Department for Transport for the West Coast Partnership.
 
Commenting, Steve Montgomery, First Rail Managing Director said:
 
"FirstGroup, with our partner Trenitalia, will bid for the upcoming West Coast Partnership. We are well positioned with our partner to develop a completely new customer proposition both on the West Coast route, and, through the exciting opportunity this franchise offers to design and run initial services on the HS2 network.
 
“We have a strong track record in delivering continued modernisation and investment, alongside industry partners, through our rail operating companies Great Western Railway, TransPennine Express and Rail Operator of the Year, Hull Trains. In August, we will begin operating the South Western rail franchise where we will deliver £1.2bn of investment and improve the experience for customers, with better trains, more seats and quicker journeys. 
 
“Our partner Trenitalia is one of Europe’s top railway operators, and manages long haul services, both on high speed and conventional lines, as well as regional and metropolitan services. That complements our expertise in running long distance services such as those found on the West Coast routes.”
 
Commenting, Barbara Morgante, CEO of Trenitalia, said: 
 
“Trenitalia will bring FS Italiane Group’s industry-leading high speed rail knowledge to the West Coast Partnership. Since our acquisition of the c2c franchise, we have overseen a significant improvement in the network’s performance and we are now looking forward to bringing this experience to the wider UK market.
 
“We believe that the UK rail market provides an excellent opportunity for the group to leverage its experience accrued in the highly competitive Italian market.
 
“Together with FirstGroup, we will focus on the customer experience and look forward to developing innovative proposals through which West Coast and HS2 passengers will be able to realise the most benefit from our services.”
 
Notes
 

First Rail Holdings (‘FRH’) and Trenitalia UK have entered into an agreement governing First Trenitalia West Coast Rail Limited to participate in the West Coast Partnership franchise competition, which amongst other terms provides that, in the event of a default by either shareholder, the other shareholder will have the right to acquire the defaulting shareholder's shares for fair value, such amount not being subject to any cap. As a consequence, and by application of Chapter 10 of the Listing Rules (in particular paragraph 5R (3A) of Annex 1 to Chapter 10), the Group is required to comply with Listing Rule 10.4.1. In compliance with that obligation, the Group provides the following information: under the terms of the partnership FRH holds 70% of the equity in First Trenitalia West Coast Rail Limited and Trenitalia UK holds the remaining 30%, with Trenitalia UK acquiring its shares from FRH for an aggregate consideration of £30, which has been satisfied from Trenitalia UK's existing financial resources. First Trenitalia West Coast Rail Limited has no trading history and has gross assets of £100.
Both FirstGroup and Trenitalia hold 'Pre-Qualification Questionnaire Passports' with DfT Rail Executive which shows that they have satisfied basic financial and other competence criteria and allows them to submit franchise bids to Government. In December 2015, Trenitalia became the first new entrant to be awarded a PQQ Passport by the Department for Transport and since then is pursuing a number of franchise opportunities.

 
 
FirstGroup plc (LSE: FGP.L) FirstGroup plc is a leading transport operator in the UK and North America. With £5.7 billion in revenue and more than 100,000 employees, we transported around two billion passengers last year. Each of our five divisions is a leader in its field: In North America, First Student is the largest provider of student transportation with a fleet of around 44,000 yellow school buses, First Transit is one of the largest providers of outsourced transit management and contracting services, while Greyhound is the only nationwide operator of scheduled intercity coaches. In the UK, First Bus is one of Britain's largest bus operators, transporting 1.6 million passengers a day, and we are one of the country's most experienced rail operators, carrying around 130 million passengers last year. Our vision is to provide solutions for an increasingly congested world... keeping people moving and communities prospering.
 
Trenitalia is the passenger rail transportation company part of FS Italiane Group, a major industrial player with an increasing international presence and   operating revenues of over 5 billion euros. FS Group runs 8,000 trains a day, serving 600 million passengers and carrying 50 million tons of freight a year, over a network exceeding 16,700 kilometres. The group’s objective is to develop a large-scale mobility and logistics project capable of contributing to the country’s economic growth. The holding company, FS Italiane, controls companies active in specific core businesses – all of which, in terms of safety levels and technological standards, are European leaders. Trenitalia, the group’s rail transportation company, is one of Europe’s top railway operators, and manages passenger transport with its long haul connections, both on high speed (Frecciarossa) and conventional lines, as well as regional and metropolitan services. On February 13th 2017 Trenitalia completed the acquisition of the c2c franchise from National Express. Other companies belonging to the FS Italiane Group include RFI, Busitalia, Italferr, Mercitalia, Ferservizi, Italcertifer, Centostazioni, GS Rail, FS Sistemi Urbani, Netinera Deutschland, TX Logistik and Thello.
