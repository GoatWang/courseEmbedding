SVPGlobal Team
Overview
Investment Professionals
Advisory Council
Infrastructure
Investor Relations
 
Our senior investment team averages over 20 years of distressed, turnaround, investment and other relevant experience. Mr. Khosla, our Founder and Chief Investment Officer, has invested in distressed companies for over 25 years in North America, Asia, and Europe, where he was one of the pioneers of the strategy in the mid-1990s. Our other senior professionals ran proprietary trading desks at investment banks, led investments at private equity firms, and spearheaded operational turnarounds. They are among the industry’s most experienced and recognized professionals.
SVP’s investment team combines the medley of skills required to execute its strategies with a focus on distressed debt restructurings and turnarounds across (i) origination and proprietary sourcing; (ii) deal underwriting and industry expertise (current themes include merchant energy, packaging, chemicals, infrastructure, and “old media”); (iii) restructuring expertise; (iv) strategic and operational capabilities; and, (v) disciplined risk management.
We currently have approximately 35 investment professionals across our offices globally, primarily in Greenwich (CT), London, Frankfurt, and Tokyo, with the majority of the team based outside the US. Our strong and visible local presence fortifies our sourcing efforts and allows us to lead the restructuring processes in those regions. Furthermore, we can better assess target companies, relative value across geographies, and leverage the complementary experiences of our teams to provide insights that are not otherwise available to purely local or regional players.
The SVP team also includes a very substantial team of experienced professionals in finance, tax, legal and compliance, operations, and investor relations.

Strategic Value Partners, LLC (“SVP”) is a distressed and deep-value investment firm which was established in 2001 by Victor Khosla, with assets of approximately $6 billion across a hedge fund strategy and private equity vehicles. The firm has about 100 employees, including approximately 35 investment professionals, across its main offices in Greenwich (CT), London, Frankfurt and Tokyo. Our focus is on distressed, deep-value opportunities where we typically take an active role in transactions, whether driving the financial restructuring of companies facing bankruptcy, on ad hoc or formal creditors’ committees, or leading the turnaround of a business by driving the strategic and operational direction of the company. The team has also developed domain expertise in a select number of industries including infrastructure, power and industrials. SVP’s significant presence outside of the US as well as the extensive restructuring and operating experience of its professionals further support the firm’s investment approach and strategy.

Philosophy & Approach | SVPGlobal

































Philosophy & Approach
Investment Philosophy
Competitive Advantages
 
Our philosophy is driven by a few simple tenets: (i) distressed debt and special situations offer attractive opportunities; (ii) entering through the top end of the capital structure provides some level of downside protection; (iii) value can be created through active involvement in the company’s restructurings and operational improvements; (iv) the distressed debt and distressed-for-control markets are inefficient; and (v) the distressed market is global.
Distressed debt and special situations offer compelling investment opportunities for reasons such as restructuring complexities, underlying operational issues and forced selling by some debt holders. Having the wherewithal to successfully navigate these issues creates significant upside potential. Experience in restructurings and operations assists in calibrating risk better, protecting the downside further and generating upside faster.
SVP attempts to exert meaningful influence in the restructuring and post-restructuring activities of its investments. SVP expects to take active roles on ad hoc or formal creditors’ committees during restructurings, sit on boards, and deploy our operating partners as needed.
We believe the distressed debt market is inefficient. Debt does not trade on a central exchange, and the trading of bank debt in particular is even more opaque. A void exists at the nexus of distressed debt and equity control: few private equity firms (due to a lack of capabilities in sourcing distressed debt or bankruptcy expertise) or distressed hedge funds (due to little operational or private equity experience) have the necessary combination of skills to make successful distressed-for-control investments. These opportunities, complexities and inefficiencies are even more acute when the global market is considered because of the different restructuring laws, sourcing channels, skill-sets and infrastructure required.
SVP recognizes the increasing importance of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters and their contribution to the value of business today and we have adopted an ESG policy. We believe that the consideration of ESG practices is an important aspect of security analysis.  In discerning the value of an enterprise through research and investment analysis, SVP takes into account ESG considerations along with other factors that may affect an issuer’s prospects.
SVP believes in investing in a broad range of distressed and deep value investments diversified by industry and geography. We will typically make investments at the top end of the capital structure (senior debt, or senior secured debt, typically private bank debt) at a substantial discount to par and what we believe is intrinsic value. The focus is on fundamentally sound businesses with characteristics such as leading market shares, high customer switching costs, hard assets, significant barriers to entry, and established franchises, but which are experiencing financial, managerial, or operational issues and are often undergoing, or about to undergo, a restructuring.
