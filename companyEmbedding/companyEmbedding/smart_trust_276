Smart Motor Technology



Dorman is the only aftermarket supplier developing today’s advanced smart motor technology Window Lift Motors.








What is a Smart Motor?
Any motor containing a Printed Circuit Board with microcontroller and embedded software.
Advanced Functions
Our circuit boards and embedded software are designed to restore all original advanced window functions such as anti-pinch, auto up/down, global open and more where applicable to the original design. Our investment in technology cements our status as the aftermarket leader in Window Regulators and the high-growth complex electronics movement.
Plug & Play Design
Our engineering expertise in Printed Circuit Board Technology allows us to deliver a complete plug-and-play fix for late model applications by offering Integrated Window Control Assemblies (IWCA) that combine a Window Regulator and Smart Window Lift Motor into one convenient SKU, where smart motors are originally supplied.

Coverage





Market Leading Coverage
Dorman offers over 2,700 Window Regulators, with additional coverage added monthly.
Exclusive Coverage
Dorman’s market leading program includes hundreds of exclusive applications.
The Right Coverage
Our product development includes extensive market input and feedback, enabling us to introduce quality parts that address the most in-demand parts you need for your business.





Quality





          											Evaluation / Benchmarking
        										











With a focus on exacting precision, Dorman analyzes both original parts and individual components at the beginning of its design process.
Dorman’s analysis establishes a complete product baseline that enables it to identify OE design flaws as opportunities for design improvements.
These steps assure that every Dorman Window Regulator released to the market delivers on its promise of proper fit, form and long lasting function.













                                                    Rigorous Quality Testing
                                                










3-Dimensional Coordinate Measuring

The 3-dimensional coordinate measuring of the doors helps minimize the risk of damage to the replacement Regulator by eliminating the need to alter the product during installation.
No bending, twisting or adjusting is required. Dorman’s Regulator achieves a perfect fit right out of the box.










Tensile Testing

Tensile testing is used to evaluate individual elements of the part assembly.
This test measures the strength of the cable and the amount of force needed to unsecure the cable from its mounting or for the cable to fray.










Material Hardness Testing

Extensive testing verifies that the correct material is being used for the application.
If a material tests poorly, the Dorman Engineering team continues testing to determine if the failure is design or material related and makes the adjustments necessary to resolve the problem and provide a best in class product.










Motor Dyno Testing

This certifies motor performance of original Window Regulator and Dorman's redesigned Window Regulator.
Verifies that the original part meets or exceeds the declared horsepower rating and the Dorman part meets or exceeds our standards for performance.










Cycle Testing

Cycle testing validates the durability and performance of every Dorman Regulator and Motor over extended cycles.
Each Regulator is installed in its corresponding door and tested for 10,000 cycles which is equivalent to three to four years of normal use.










On-Vehicle Testing

Each and every Dorman Window Regulator is tested on a vehicle to ensure a trouble-free installation, excellent performance and operational durability.
This real-life testing assists in creating step-by-step installation instructions, and gives insight into future product enhancements.











Innovation




 
 
 
























                                                        Window Slides
                                                    








OE Problem:
Plastic inserts used in original window slide becomes brittle and cracks over time, allowing cable ends to tear free.




Dorman replaced the original plastic with a nylon material, which improved the durability and eliminated the premature pull-out of the Window Regulator cable.












                                                        Cable Slides
                                                    








OE Problem:
Original cable guide relies on a rectangular design that commonly breaks, causing the cable to pull free.




Dorman redesigned the rectangular cable end to a cylindrical design with robust material to prevent breakage.












                                                        Mounting Brackets
                                                    








OE Problem:
Originally designed as a flat, stamped steel piece that had the tendency to bend under limited regulator stress.




Dorman replaced the original steel with a thicker, more durable metal, and re-engineered the bracket in a rolled-edge design for additional strength. This allows the bracket to withstand greater wear stress than the original design.












                                                        Metal Arms
                                                    








OE Problem:
These metal arms were originally designed with 2.0mm steel and had the tendency to bend and twist under normal use.




Dorman redesigned the metal arms with an improved grade of metal at an increased thickness to prevent the bending and twisting that was previously an issue with this Window Regulator style.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

 Produce Graphics the Easy Way
Without formal graphics training, most new CorelDRAW users typically struggle to develop a basic proficiency in the program. Instead of having to learn complex production techniques, Smart Designer does most of the work. If you are new to CorelDRAW, you can immediately be successful with Smart Designer. If you are an advanced user of CorelDRAW, you can dramatically reduce both your production and design time. Smart Designer makes it possible for anyone, regardless of skill level, to produce high quality custom graphics quickly and easily. Anyone that produces graphics relies on two basic technologies: graphic design software and digital artwork (clip art, templates, fonts, etc). We combined both into a graphics system. Smart Designer Pro is the core component of the Digital Art Solutions Graphics System.

Testimonials

"Smart Designs was the best investment we have made yet as far as software touse for designing artwork. My wife and I have both worked with 	computer graphic programs for years, and the Smart Templates which come with the Smart Designs package are simple to use for almost any job (Including the Pad Printer for custom graphics). You simply browse through the templates for something similar to what your customer needs, then alter it to fit their purposes with just a few mouse clicks. It is also great for printing out several QUICK ideas in color to show your customers. And, as such, makes it a great sales tool as well. Nothing impresses customers better than seeing a proof before they buy. Trust me, it's worth the money! Hope this helps."

                        Ad Printers (Press-a-Print Owner)


"Being in marketing and advertising for nearly twenty years, I've done everything from working with designers on concepts to spending hours RECREATING concepts I was seeking in the first place. Artwork can be completely consuming if you don't use the reliable resources at your fingertips. I stumbled across Digital Art Solutions at an ASI show years ago and was awestruck by the simplicity of Smart Designer and the ease of having amazing custom artwork, ready to go with just a few mouse clicks. I now own multiple DAS art volumes and can't imagine how anyone in this industry works without it. You should NEVER be at the mercy of a designer!I ALWAYS go to my clients with artwork in hand and ready to place orders. Sure, they can use the guy with the best bid but good artwork ALWAYS wins over an order form and no idea of what you are buying. I've gone from providing wearables as a compliment to my other work to being a mainstream embroidery and screen printing business. If you are in business to make real money then I would encourage you to take a good hard look at Smart Designer. Not only will you be provided cutting edge artwork but I assure you that the customer support is unbelievable! I still take complete advantage of the entire team. Being a DAS "member" has its advantages. "

Upgrading software is an important investment in your business
Software companies like Corel or Microsoft spend millions of dollars improving their software and releasing new versions. Software companies are always striving to produce innovative new features that help their customers to be more productive. When you buy a software program, you always have the option of staying within your comfort level and not upgrading. The loss of productivity and inefficiencies associated with using older technology is typically much more expensive than upgrading to a new version. A wise business owner will buy an upgraded version because they want to improve their workflow, reduce the time spent in the software, and increase productivity. Please review our PDF Upgrade guide for information on upgrading.
