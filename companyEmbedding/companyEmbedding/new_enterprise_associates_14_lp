One Team. A World of Opportunity.

As one of the world’s largest and most active venture capital firms, NEA has developed deep domain expertise and insight into our industries of focus.  We channel that knowledge into every technology and healthcare investment we make -- at any stage, in any location, around the globe. 













In Key Industries

Across our portfolio, visionary entrepreneurs are at the helm of current and future industry leaders, fueling the development of technologies that will keep the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. Some of the most successful business leaders in each of these industries have joined forces with NEA as Venture Partners, bringing tremendous sector insight and deep networks.





Technology




We’ve built a premier IT franchise by fueling the growth of disruptive technologies and market leaders across several key sectors, including electronics, consumer technology, enterprise mobility, virtualization, tech-enabled services, SaaS and cloud computing.


View Technology




Healthcare




With a focus on biopharmaceuticals, healthcare services/IT and medical devices, we have long track record of partnering with companies that have pioneered transformative innovations in healthcare, such as balloon angioplasty and laparoscopic surgery.


View Healthcare








Across All Stages










NEA’s proven investment strategy spans all stages of a company's growth, from seeding innovations in emerging markets to funding early-stage companies in high-growth markets to fueling the growth of market leaders. Any stage of growth is the right stage to partner with NEA. We can add value and offer expert guidance throughout your company’s lifecycle—whether your big idea is at its inception or has already progressed to be a viable reality.






At A Global Scale

The last two decades have marked the largest expansion of the global economy the world has ever seen, with more than half of the expansion attributable to emerging economies. With bi-coastal U.S. operations and a growing international presence, NEA stays on the cutting edge of new technologies as we expand our global network.

Growing up on Both Coasts

More than 35 years ago, our founders formed the industry’s first truly bi-coastal firm. Our US presence has grown to include offices in Menlo Park, Washington, DC, New York and Chicago. This enables NEA to find the best opportunities at the source of innovation, and to build a vast network of resources and expertise from coast to coast.





Thinking Globally

NEA actively invests in emerging markets, particularly in India and China, and is continuously expanding our global network to benefit companies in our portfolio--many of which are operating internationally from the earliest stages. Today our investing activities span six continents, and we think the world seems a little flatter every day.








Key Benefits




Network
People are the driving force behind every successful business--including ours. This is what 'value add' means.



Deep roots and strong ties matter, and partnering with NEA means joining a thriving network of business leaders, successful entrepreneurs, technologists, vendors and potential customers. Entrepreneurs often tell us that our network is even more valuable than the capital we invest. We're committed to making sure that's the case.





Scale
Over 35 years, $17 Billion and more than 500 liquidity events, we've learned that size does have its advantages. 



We use ours to create a global platform that gives us the insight, the flexibility and the efficiency to invest in big ideas--no matter where they are, or how far along they might be. Our scale enables us to seed innovations in emerging markets, fund early-stage companies in high-growth sectors, and fuel the growth of market leaders.





Depth
We are investors... and operators, technologists and entrepreneurs. We really do know it when we see it.   



Nobody ever said sourcing innovation, spotting big market opportunities and building great businesses was easy--it's not! And doing it well for nearly four decades is no fluke. By combining deep sector knowledge, a collaborative team structure, and the broad perspective scale brings, we show up early, dive deep and make things happen.

United States

Geographic diversity has long been a hallmark of NEA, founded on both U.S. coasts in 1977 and still deeply rooted in Silicon Valley and the Mid-Atlantic. Ask someone where NEA is headquartered, and you'll see how ingrained that dual citizenship is--they'll think about it for a minute, and then either admit they don't know or err on the side of their home office. It makes for some fierce sports rivalries, but it also makes us better investors. We have cross-functional, cross-country collaboration down to such a science it's bordering on art. We want to find and fund innovation at its source, and innovation is everywhere. That pursuit of innovation and great partnerships has led us to spend a lot more time in certain hubs, and over the last few years NEA has established small offices in New York and Chicago.




Menlo Park

Innovation is everywhere, but Silicon Valley is still the undisputed hub of the venture capital and startup ecosystems--and few would dispute that Sand Hill Road is to venture capital what Wall Street is to the stock markets. NEA's founding West Coast office was in San Francisco, and while we're active up and down the west coast, Sand Hill Road has been home since the mid-80s.




Washington, DC

NEA's East Coast roots are spread across the metropolitan DC region, with a founding office in Baltimore and a second location in Virginia. Our dual residency came to an end in 2007, when our East Coast investing staff moved into our current Friendship Heights location. Our operations team has stayed close to the firm's Baltimore roots with an office in nearby Timonium.






San Francisco

In 2016 we harkened back to our city roots and opened an office in San Francisco. The office is located in the South Park neighborhood—a  recognized startup and VC mecca in the area. The space is designed as collaborative and approachable work environment that serves as a landing place for NEA team members, and also provides us with an awesome spot to host meetings and events.




New York

In recent years, we've been spending more and more time in New York. The region's vibrant startup ecosystem, coupled with top tech and design talent, has made it a hub for digital media and consumer internet companies. We occupied office space in 2011, and earlier this year we launched NEA Studio to support entrepreneurial designers as they make the leap to company formation and funding.






Boston

Boston has undoubtably established itself as a force within the innovation ecosystem. We have a history of partnering with New England-based startups, and currently have over two dozen active portfolio companies in Boston and surrounding areas. In 2013, we decided to formalize our relationship with the city by opening an office in the Cambridge biopharma hub, Kendall Square.




Chicago

Our portfolio spans six continents, but we have invested more capital in Chicago than in any other municipality outside of Silicon Valley. We like Chicago's unique entrepreneurial spirit--the blend of midwest sensibilities and leading edge tech that has transformed legacy industries like printing and logistics. To better serve our local portfolio, we opened a small office here in 2012.
