 GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy likes how the team's young players are performing in minicamp.




McCarthy said before Wednesday's workouts that the reps are critical for the young players. He singled out a few Packers including cornerback Damarious Randall, who McCarthy says has been outstanding this offseason.Randall, who is entering his third NFL season, was one of a number of cornerbacks plagued by injuries last season. He's practicing at the nickelback position during offseason workouts.Green Bay beefed up its secondary in the offseason with the return of veteran Davon House, as well as adding defensive backs Kevin King and Josh Jones in the draft.The three-day minicamp wraps up on Thursday.___More AP NFL: pro32.ap.org  and twitter.com/AP_NFL

 Educational Background



 


Miami University

                  Miami University is one of the oldest public universities in the country, made possible by an ordinance signed by President George Washington in 1795. Chartered in 1809, Miami welcomed its first students in 1824. Miami's reputation grew as quickly as its enrollment, and it became known as the "Yale of the West" for its ambitious liberal arts curriculum. Today, Miami consistently ranks among the nation's top public universities for the quality of teaching and overall student experience.

One of Miami University's most famous graduates was Benjamin Harrison, who later became a President of the United States. Professor William Holmes McGuffey revolutionized the education of generations of Americans when he conducted research for his Eclectic Readers series while teaching at Miami from 1826 to 1836. The "mother of fraternities," Miami was the founding site of four national fraternities: Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Tau; as well as Delta Zeta sorority.                




 


University of Ottawa

                  University of Ottawa is a bilingual public research university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The main campus is located on 42.5 hectares (105 acres) in the residential neighbourhood of Sandy Hill, adjacent to Ottawa's Rideau Canal. The University offers a wide variety of academic programs, administered by ten faculties.
The University of Ottawa was first established as the College of Bytown in 1848 by the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa Joseph-Bruno Guigues (French priest). Placed under the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, it was renamed the College of Ottawa in 1861 and received university status five years later through royal charter. On 5 February 1889, the University was granted a pontifical charter by Pope Leo XIII, elevating the institution to a pontifical university. The University was reorganized on 1 July 1965 as a corporation, independent from any outside body or religious organization. As a result, the civil and pontifical charters were kept by the newly created Saint Paul University, federated with the University. The remaining civil faculties were retained by the reorganized University.
