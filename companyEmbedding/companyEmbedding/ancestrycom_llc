Stories from Our Members
Emily
Lezlie
Kyle
Idries and Jamil
Katherine and Eric




Holy crow! I'm related to George Washington.”
Just days after beginning her family history search, Emily discovered a truly legendary ancestor. With the help of Ancestry Hints, she traced her family all the way back to her ten-times great grandmother, who just so happened to also be George Washington’s aunt.
Emily found a presidential cousin—who could be hiding in your family tree?

Find your story








What are you? What are you? What are you?”
Growing up, Lezlie had always encountered curiosity about her ethnicity from people she'd meet. “I probably got the question 3 to 4 times a week if I was Asian or Moroccan or something else,” she shared. So she jumped at the opportunity to find out through AncestryDNA.
And it turns out, Lezlie's DNA results did include African, European, and Asian. “It was great because it helped confirm what I knew in my gut… with a little surprise.”

Explore your ethnicity








So I traded in my lederhosen for a kilt.”
Growing up, Kyle’s family was German, no doubt about it. He even grew up wearing lederhosen in a German dance troupe. But when Kyle began building his family tree, he couldn’t actually find any German ancestors.
“So I decided to have my DNA tested, and the big surprise was we're not German at all,” he says. And soon enough, Ancestry Hints led him to generations of Scottish ancestors.
What surprises are hiding in your family tree?

It just made me feel like I belong somewhere.”
When Idries created his family tree, he started with just the name of his parents and grandparents. Soon, Ancestry Hints started popping up: "I was getting all these leaves, taking me back generation after generation."
Joining forces with his twin, Jamil, the brothers uncovered fascinating stories about their ancestors. They both agree, "You feel like you know these people—you feel connected to them."

Start your family tree








I thought I had married an Italian?”
Marrying into Eric's family, Katherine was told of a rich Italian family history—"My lineage was all Vecchios and the Zuccolis," according to Eric. But when Eric's AncestryDNA results said he was only 16%, Katherine took on the search and discovered an Eastern European ancestor he never knew he had.
Katherine and Eric used both AncestryDNA and a family tree to solve their mystery—how will you begin your journey?

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

Ancestry Business Updates
Company — On April 1, 2016, the Company announced that Silver Lake, a premier investor in technology companies, and GIC, a current investor in Ancestry, have signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantial minority equity stakes in its indirect parent entity from existing equity holders at an enterprise value of approximately $2.6 billion. Following the transaction Silver Lake and GIC will hold equal minority ownership positions, while other current investors and Ancestry management will retain meaningful equity investments in the Company and, along with GIC, will continue to own a majority of the Company. Ancestry anticipates recognizing transaction-related charges associated with this agreement upon close of the transaction.
Subscribers — Subscribers of Ancestry websites totaled approximately 2,372,000 as of March 31, 2016, up 5% compared to December 31, 2015 and up 7% compared to March 31, 2015.
AncestryDNA — Now available in more than 30 countries, including new markets across Western and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and Asia.
Content — During the first quarter of 2016, the Company added to its collection of more than 17 billion records through the launch of significant collections from various sources which include:Ireland, Catholic Parish Registers, 1655-1915
Michigan, Death Records, 1867-1950
Northampton Church of England Baptisms, Burials, 1532-1812 and Marriages, 1754-1912
Indiana and New Jersey Methodist Church Records
German Lutheran Church Records

Newspapers.com — The Company launched the Publisher Extra subscription on Newspapers.com, giving subscribers access to all content across all publisher partners, which in many cases includes content from the first date of the publication hundreds of years ago through recent editions from 30 days ago.
Conference Call and Webcast
Ancestry.com will host a conference call today at 3:00 p.m. MT (5:00 p.m. ET). Participants can access the conference call by dialing (844) 831-3026 (domestic toll-free) or (315) 625-6887 (international) approximately ten minutes prior to the start time.
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are useful measures of operating performance because they exclude items that the Company does not consider indicative of its core performance. In the case of adjusted EBITDA, net income (loss) is adjusted for interest expense, net; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); and non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Free cash flow subtracts from adjusted EBITDA the capitalization of content databases, purchases of property and equipment and cash received (paid) for income taxes and interest. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of these non-GAAP measures, is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited summary financial statements.
The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as measures of operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of the annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of its business; to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies; and in communications with its operating committee concerning its financial performance. The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA as a factor when determining the incentive compensation pool.

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

Calico will then focus its efforts to develop and commercialize any potential therapeutics that emerge from the analysis.[173]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

Ancestry.com is partnered with ProQuest LLC. ProQuest distributes Ancestry Library Edition worldwide to public and academic libraries, K-12 schools, and other institutions.
Ancestry is partnered with Calico, a company focused on longevity research and therapeutics, in an effort to investigate human heredity of lifespan. Together, they evaluate anonymized data from millions of public family trees and a growing database of over one million genetic samples. AncestryDNA and Calico will work together to analyze and investigate the role of genetics and its influences in families experiencing unusual longevity using Ancestry's proprietary databases, tools and algorithms. Calico will then focus its efforts to develop and commercialize any potential therapeutics that emerge from the analysis.[173]

History[edit]
Infobases, Inc.[edit]




Ancestry.com former headquarters in Provo, Utah


In 1990, Paul B. Allen[8] and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad Pelo. Infobases chose to use the Folio infobase technology, which Allen was familiar with, as the basis for their products.
Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.[9] Their first offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for $299.95,[10] which was offered in an online version in August 1995.[11] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of Ancestry.com in 1996.[12]
Ancestry.com[edit]
With its roots as a genealogy newsletter started in 1983 by John Sittner,[citation needed] Ancestry, Inc. became an established publishing company in 1984.[13] Ancestry was relaunched as a magazine in January 1994,[citation needed] and went online in 1996.[13] On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,[14] publisher of Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.[15]
In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open Market for $45 million.[16] The first public evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry Magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web address.
More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc. purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church.[17][18] Infobases had published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.
Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online subscription-based genealogy database services.[19]
In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market, Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined as a single product by Deseret Book.[20][21]
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional free sites beginning in March 1999.[22] The site generated one million registered users within its first 140 days.[19] The company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors[19] and changed its name on November 17, 1999 from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genaealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.[23] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.[24]
In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem, Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodates about 700 agents at a time, in Provo.[25] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005,[26] and sold a year later in August 2006.[citation needed] The Ancestry.ca website was opened on 24 January 2006.[27] In March 2006, MyFamily opened a new office in Bellevue, Washington, as part of the MyFamily business unit.[28] Encounter Technologies was acquired in April 2006.[29]




The Generations Network logo (2007–2009)


By 2006[update], the Ancestry.com database contained information on 500 million people, information from every U.S. census record from 1790 to 1930.[30] On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network."[31] While the company had been offering free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers, that service was terminated on 17 March 2007, because TGN and the LDS Church were unable to reach a mutually agreeable licensing agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored access to its site at Family History Centers.




The Ancestry.com logo (2009-2015)


On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name to "Ancestry.com".[32]
In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing Company.[33] In the same year, Ancestry.com discontinued the publication of Ancestry Magazine, after 25 years of publication,[34] and Genealogical Computing.[35]
Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM) on November 5, 2009, with an initial public offering of 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO Capital Markets.[36][37]
Ancestry.com continued its partnership with NBC for the Who Do You Think You Are? television series in 2011. The television show went into its fourth season in 2016. [38]
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry launched an Android and iOS app.[39][40]
In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of identity theft concerns.[41]
In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from GeneTree.[42]
In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call centre for international customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.[43][44]
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.[45][46] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories.[47]
In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave.[48] A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of the South African genealogy website Ancestry24, which ceased operating in February 2013.[49][50]
Products and services[edit]
Ancestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website and DNA product with over 16 billion records online.[51] The majority of records are from the United States, though records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and other European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access, but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription.[52] As of 2017[update], the monthly subscription cost for access to Ancestry.com's main databases was US$19.99 for US records only, US$34.99 for all US and international records, and US$44.99 for access to all ancestry records and additional features.[53]
On June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930.[54][55]
Ancestry.com was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the "Best Online Consumer Information Service" category.[56]
For genetic genealogy, Ancestry.com's AncestryDNA service offers genealogical DNA tests of autosomal DNA.[57]
AncestryDNA[edit]
AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.[58] Consumers provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA users and to provide what it call an "ethnicity estimate." Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June 2014.[59] The company describes the techncial process of testing in a scientific white paper.[60]
AncestryHealth[edit]
On July 16, 2015 Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, a generational health database.[61] At the same time, the company also announced the appointment of Dr. Cathy A. Petti, MD as AncestryHealth's Chief Health Officer.[62]
Other sites[edit]
Ancestry24[edit]
On October 22, 2013, Ancestry.com purchased Ancestry24, which had ceased operating in February 2013. It was an online archive and research service owned by Media24 that preserved South Africa’s history for future generations in the form of a collection of databases that included millions of records on individuals who have lived in South Africa since the late 1600s. Transcribed from original documents and reliable resources, records included births, baptisms, marriages, deaths, burials, passenger lists and voters lists. It also had an image library of over 33,000 graves.
FindAGrave.com[edit]
On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com had, "...been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their family history....” Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.[63][64]
Fold3[edit]
Fold3 is a subscription-based website specializing in historical military records primarily from the United States. It also has a large collection of documents dealing with the United States, city directories, and newspapers. Some record sets are free[65] but the majority are accessible only by paid subscription. The website was originally named Footnote.com and independently owned when it launched in 2007. Footnote.com was acquired by Ancestry.com in fall 2010.[66] As part of the acquisition, Footnote.com was later rebranded as Fold3 in an effort to focus on military records.
Genealogy.com[edit]
Genealogy.com as a company started in 1989 with the creation and marketing of the Family Tree Maker software.[13] Genealogy.com maintains a genealogy research website with some records not found on Ancestry.com, though the total number of records available is smaller. As of 2001[update], Genealogy.com was noted as being Ancestry.com's greatest competitor.[13] Genealogy.com was acquired by A&E Networks in February 2001,[13] and subsequently by MyFamily.com in 2003.[67]
LongLostPeople.com[edit]
LongLostPeople.com allows one to search public records for living people in the United States.[68]
MyFamily.com[edit]
MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group, websites. Customization was limited. The 1998 version is still available but no further enhancements are planned.[citation needed] After three years of a beta release 2.0, it was running the first non-beta release, "MyFamily.com 2.5.3". However, since the architecture was changed so radically from 2.0 to 2.5, internally at MyFamily all references to v2.5 are actually being called v3.0.[69] Users of version 3.0 (a.k.a. 2.5) last saw an update to the code in February 2010. Since that date both v1.0 and v3.0 have been 'frozen'.[70] Migration services from v1.0 to v3.0 were stopped on 21 March 2010 with no reason given.[71] Many features of the original version of the site were not ported to release v3.0, although new features such as video support, blog support, social group interface, and unlimited storage were introduced.[72] Also in May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington, development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since the offer to move to Provo, Utah, was not accepted by any staff. Since the loss of the Washington office, no new features have been added nor have any current problems or bugs been resolved.[citation needed] As of July 2010, free sites on v3.0 were discontinued.[70] Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.[73] Members were informed they could download zip files of their data if they desired.[74] At the shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.[75]
Newspapers.com[edit]
Newspapers.com is a subscription-based website launched in November 2012,[76] which provides access to historical newspapers, mostly from the United States, for genealogical and historical research.
Ancestry Academy[edit]
Ancestry Academy is a website that offers high-quality video instruction from family history and genealogy experts. Launched in April 2015,[77] it covers a wide range of topics of interest in family history research, including Native American ancestry, online US census research, and DNA testing. New courses are added monthly.
RootsWeb[edit]
RootsWeb was acquired by Ancestry in June 2000.[78] RootsWeb is a free genealogy community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources to help people research their family history. Founded in 1993 by Brian Leverich and Karen Isaacson as the Roots Surname List, it is the oldest free online community genealogy research site.[79] Users can upload GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry websites. RootsWeb provides resources[80] (such as webspace, mailing list, message boards) for the WorldGenWeb project.
AncestryProGenealogists[edit]
AncestryProGenealogists is the official Ancestry research firm. Its professional genealogists perform private research for individual clients, as well as for various TV shows and public relations efforts.
Publications[edit]
Ancestry.com produces two publications: Ancestry magazine and the quarterly journal Genealogical Computing, as well as the corporate newsletter Ancestry Daily News.[13] Ancestry.com also published data sets on CD-ROM and a variety of books.[13]
Site users and traffic[edit]
In mid-2001, Medill News Service reported the Ancestry.com had more than 350,000 subscribers.[13] In the first quarter of 2012, Ancestry had 1.87 million users.[81] According to Quantcast, as of April 2012, Ancestry.com reached a rough estimate of 8.3 – 8.4 million people in the US.[82]
In the second quarter of 2014, Ancestry had 2.11 million users, for a loss of 52,000 subscribers when compared to the first quarter of 2014.[83]

Family Tree Maker (FTM) was advertised as "the #1 selling family history software".[87] As with other genealogy software, FTM allowed the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information. The software was originally developed by Kenneth Hess of Banner Blue Software,[84] which was purchased by Brøderbund in 1995.[88] It passed through the hands of The Learning Company, Mattel, and others before coming under its current ownership.
A redesigned Family Tree Maker 2008 was released on August 14, 2007.[89] The 2009 version of the program corrected some of the errors and omissions of its predecessor, and introduced a few new features.[citation needed] Family Tree Maker 2010 claimed to further enhance the radical re-design and be more powerful and feature-packed with faster navigation and quicker load times.[90]
A version for the Mac was released in 1997, but due to low market demand was discontinued[91] for over a decade. A new version of Family Tree Maker for Mac was released on November 4, 2010.[92]
Family Tree Maker Version 16 was awarded a CODiE Award in the "Best Consumer Productivity Solution" category in 2006.[93]
On December 8, 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it would discontinue Family Tree Maker.[94] The announcement was met by fierce protest from Family Tree Maker users.[95] On February 2, 2016, Ancestry.com announced that Software MacKiev, the company that had developed the Mac version of the software for more than six years, would acquire the Family Tree Maker brand, and take over the development and publishing of Mac and Windows editions.[96]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ancestry.Com LLC (NASDAQ:ACOM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Stories from Our Members
Emily
Lezlie
Kyle
Idries and Jamil
Katherine and Eric




Holy crow! I'm related to George Washington.”
Just days after beginning her family history search, Emily discovered a truly legendary ancestor. With the help of Ancestry Hints, she traced her family all the way back to her ten-times great grandmother, who just so happened to also be George Washington’s aunt.
Emily found a presidential cousin—who could be hiding in your family tree?

Find your story








What are you? What are you? What are you?”
Growing up, Lezlie had always encountered curiosity about her ethnicity from people she'd meet. “I probably got the question 3 to 4 times a week if I was Asian or Moroccan or something else,” she shared. So she jumped at the opportunity to find out through AncestryDNA.
And it turns out, Lezlie's DNA results did include African, European, and Asian. “It was great because it helped confirm what I knew in my gut… with a little surprise.”

Explore your ethnicity








So I traded in my lederhosen for a kilt.”
Growing up, Kyle’s family was German, no doubt about it. He even grew up wearing lederhosen in a German dance troupe. But when Kyle began building his family tree, he couldn’t actually find any German ancestors.
“So I decided to have my DNA tested, and the big surprise was we're not German at all,” he says. And soon enough, Ancestry Hints led him to generations of Scottish ancestors.
What surprises are hiding in your family tree?

It just made me feel like I belong somewhere.”
When Idries created his family tree, he started with just the name of his parents and grandparents. Soon, Ancestry Hints started popping up: "I was getting all these leaves, taking me back generation after generation."
Joining forces with his twin, Jamil, the brothers uncovered fascinating stories about their ancestors. They both agree, "You feel like you know these people—you feel connected to them."

Start your family tree








I thought I had married an Italian?”
Marrying into Eric's family, Katherine was told of a rich Italian family history—"My lineage was all Vecchios and the Zuccolis," according to Eric. But when Eric's AncestryDNA results said he was only 16%, Katherine took on the search and discovered an Eastern European ancestor he never knew he had.
Katherine and Eric used both AncestryDNA and a family tree to solve their mystery—how will you begin your journey?

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        Ancestry.com has received 3.73 out of 5 stars based on 90 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
