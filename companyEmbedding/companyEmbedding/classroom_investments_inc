Classroom Investments Inc v Frank Hu Chuanping & others


					HK Court of First Instance, 10-Jun-2016
				
The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan pursues a soured US$175m pre-IPO private equity deal in Chinese hospitals, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation. Perhaps the deal should have carried a health warning. More than a decade earlier, in Feb-2005, China Hospitals, Inc had filed an F-1 for an IPO on Nasdaq, but this was aborted.

set level, are white on both sides to reflect light, durable and portable.All students are familiar with the library and know the importance placed on �quiet� in this area. What may come as a surprise to educators is
that librarians are privy to inside information about the environment within the library. The secret is this � study carrels. All public libraries and
institutions of higher learning offer these quiet zone areas for reading and study. They spend large amounts of money to provide these
individualized spaces because they are extremely effective for learning.During a student�s early years in kindergarten, elementary and middle school it is vital that they develop strong reading and language skills.
Most libraries at these levels only offer large tables or desks, mostly due to budget constraints. ClassroomProducts.com has the solution with
their inexpensive, portable study carrels and tablet carrels. Kenny Kiskis from ClassroomProducts.com states, �Libraries have used study
carrels for years knowing their capability of keeping noise levels down, and giving user�s privacy and a better environment for
focusing on their work.�Regardless of the grade level, students should have carrel spaces to read and learn. In the library setting this is particularly important to
fostering a love of books and a feeling of success during the reading process. The carrels offered by ClassroomProducts.com will match
the needs of the learners and the budget of schools.

(Smellie CJ presiding) the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (Grand Court) granted the Plaintiff's application for a freezing injunction in aid of foreign proceedings in Hong Kong.It is the first order made pursuant to the recently enacted section 11A of the Grand Court Law (2008 Revision) (as amended) (the Law), which places on a statutory footing the jurisdiction of the Grand Court to grant interim relief in aid of foreign (ie non – Caymanian) proceedings.
Facts
The Plaintiff purchased shares in the First Defendant, who represented that it had entered into binding agreements to acquire a number of hospitals and that it would make best endeavours to achieve an IPO. However, the relevant contracts were in fact entered into by companies in the Second Defendant's structure.The Plaintiff had no interest whatsoever in the Second Defendant. The Plaintiff brought allegations of fraud against a number of companies, including the Defendants, in relation to the application and misappropriation of its subscription monies.
The Defendants were incorporated in the Cayman Islands.The Plaintiff obtained a worldwide freezing injunction in the Hong Kong Court against various other defendants, but not against these Defendants as they were not subject to the Hong Kong Court's personal jurisdiction.The Plaintiff sought freezing relief in order to protect its tracing claims, ensure that the structure that the Plaintiff thought existed remained in situ and, perhaps most importantly, provide for disclosure of information by the Defendants.
Threshold
Section 11A of the Law adopts different wording to the test in the comparable English legislation.Under section 11A, the Grand Court may refuse an application for the appointment of a receiver or the grant of interim relief, if, in its opinion, it would be unjust or inconvenient to grant the application; the wording under the English provision is inexpedient.The Grand Court's observations on the effect of this difference in wording were not entirely consistent. On one hand it found that the section 11A approach would in substance, be the same and that it invoked a test of fairness and convenience to similar effect as the English provision. Yet, it later commented that the section 11A wording could be regarded as possibly broader, although nothing turned on this difference on the particular facts of this case.It might be open for future applicants for section 11A freezing relief to argue that the test in Cayman is broader.That said, the exercise  will always be fact sensitive and it is therefore unlikely that the semantics of the legal test will materially influence outcomes.
English guidance
The Grand Court, unsurprisingly, relied heavily on English rulings in relation to the factors relevant to the inexpediency test1. Interim relief should not be limited to that which would be available in the Court trying the substantive dispute.Factors weighing against interim relief might include: if it would obstruct or hamper the management of the case by the primary court, if it would give rise to risk of conflicting, inconsistent or overlapping orders, orif the primary court declined to grant interim relief.It might weigh in favour of interim relief if the defendant is present in the country in which the application has been brought.
The Grand Court also summarised the relevant principles provided by Neuberger J (as he then was) in Ryan v Friction Dynamics :

The domestic court should always exercise caution in freezing order applications;
Particular caution should be exercised in freezing order applications in aid of foreign proceedings;
Yet the domestic court should not be timid if satisfied that good grounds exist;
The basic requirements of a domestic freezing order still need to be satisfied eg good arguable case, real risk of dissipation;
It weighed against granting a freezing order where the foreign court had refused to do so;
The existence of a worldwide freezing order did not prevent the domestic court granting an overlapping order;
The domestic court should expect to be given cogent reasons to justify granting an overlapping order given that such orders lead to increased costs, time and double jeopardy risk;
Where an overlapping order is granted  it is sensible to indicate which court is to have primary enforcement responsibility;
Where an overlapping order is granted the domestic court should avoid inconsistency with the terms of the foreign court's order.

Decision
The Plaintiff met the section 11A gateway.The Grand Court had no concerns in relation to overlapping orders, double jeopardy or forum shopping.Interestingly, it was not relevant whether the Defendants' assets were based in the Cayman Islands – disclosure orders for such information were often the most valuable part of the relief sought.The fact that no injunctive relief was obtained in Hong Kong against these Defendants was not a relevant consideration; it would only be relevant if such an application had been made but refused by the foreign court (although this point  was by no means settled in the case law).The Grand Court ultimately applied the domestic principles for considering freezing relief and granted the Plaintiff's application.
Conclusion
The Grand Court's decision in Classroom Investments Inc. is helpful because it provides the first indication of how the Cayman Courts will apply section 11A of the Law when they are faced with an application for an injunction in aid of foreign proceedings.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care. Visit http://www.merrilledge.com/retirement/rollover-ira or call a Merrill Edge rollover specialist at 888.637.3343 for additional information about your choices.
