Petition ClosedPetitioning U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of Ohio U.S. Attorney Carter M. StewartDecision makersU.S. Attorney Carter M. StewartU.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of OhioJustice for our son, John CrawfordJohn Crawford III Family United StatesJohn Crawford III FamilyUnited States71,451SupportersOn August 5, 2014, our lives changed forever. Our unarmed son John Crawford III was killed by police while shopping at a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio. On this tragic day, John was shopping like any other customer in the store. He was looking at a few items on the shelf, holding a toy BB gun he might buy and talking on his phone with the mother of his two children. Other customers shopped near our son, showing no sign that John was any kind of threat while he shopped. Everything was normal until Officer Sean Williams suddenly began shooting him without any warning. In the video above, you can see this was a heinous and unjustifiable killing. 
We fought for months to get Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine to release that surveillance footage to the public. And while the video shows our unarmed son being ruthlessly killed, Mr. DeWine’s office delayed the grand jury and then presented a half-hearted case against Officer Williams. So we were not surprised that the grand jury declined to bring charges against Williams, the reckless and dangerous officer who was also involved in a 2010 fatal shooting for which he was never prosecuted. 
We may be delayed, but we won't be denied. We won't stop until we receive justice for our son. The US Justice Department is currently conducting a civil rights investigation into John’s case. We believe that the video footage clearly demonstrates that it is time for the federal prosecutor to bring charges against Officer Williams. 
This may be our last chance to do so, and we need your help as we seek justice for our son. Please sign our new petition demanding that U.S. Attorney Carter M. Stewart bring justice to John and our family. We are grateful for your continued support.This petition was delivered to:U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of OhioU.S. Attorney Carter M.

FBI informant: John Crawford destroyed Oklahoma's oldest insurance company

UPDATE: midnight, 2010/08/25. Nearly 120,000 Oklahoma Republicans voted in the runoff, and 70% of them voted for John Doak. Congratulations to Mr. Doak and the Oklahoma GOP. This year's turnout is only slightly lower than the 2006 runoff, which was dominated by the high-profile, expensive and fierce runoff for Lt. Governor between Scott Pruitt and Todd Hiett.
(Turnout was up almost 10% in the 5th Congressional District runoff. About 42,000 voted in the 2006 runoff between Mary Fallin and Mick Cornett, while about 46,000 voted in this year's James Lankford vs. Kevin Calvey bout. Fallin beat Cornett 63-37. Lankford beat Calvey 65-35.)
There's always the danger, in a minor election especially, that people will vote for someone with a familiar name. That's a problem if the name is familiar for the wrong reasons. How else can you explain a first place primary finish for John Crawford, the former Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner who was the subject of a federal corruption investigation.
James L. Harlin (FSA, CLU, ChFC, FLMI, MAAA)  was an informant to the FBI during its investigation of John P. Crawford during his term as Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner from 1995 to 1999. Last week, Harlin spoke to the Oklahoma Conservative Political Action Committee (OCPAC). Charlie Meadows, OCPAC chairman, sent Harlin's statement out to his email list. (If you'd like to subscribe to the OCPAC's weekly email newsletter, send a note to Mr. Meadows at charliemeadows7 at gmail dot com.)
Harlin alleges that Crawford, as Mid-Continent Life actuary, created an actuarially unsound insurance product, then, as Insurance Commissioner, interfered with the sale of the company, abused his power to seize the company, destroyed the company and hundreds of Oklahoma jobs, and deterred other investment in Oklahoma by an outside company; Crawford's official actions, according to Harlin, convinced them that Oklahoma was a corrupt backwater of cronyism.
Oklahoma Republicans need to show up at the polls today, August 24, 2010, and vote for John Doak for Insurance Commissioner. Doak has strong industry experience, is a conservative, and has a sterling reputation. He will be a strong standard-bearer in the November election. Crawford's name on the ballot would not only kill our chances of having a pro-life, anti-Obamacare Insurance Commissioner, but it's likely to stain the entire Republican ticket.
Here is Mr. Harlin's statement:
John Crawford & Mid-Continent Life
August 18, 2010

Purpose
To share my direct experience with John Crawford when he was Insurance Commissioner. To defeat Crawford in the primary runoff August 24 because there is a strong chance that the Republican nominee will become the next commissioner.
Opening
There are numerous examples of John Crawford's incompetence, cronyism and corruption. These include his weak credentials as an actuary, channeling money to his son in a dubious technology scheme, having his chief of staff raise campaign funds while on the payroll of a company he illegally seized, FBI investigations, etc.
MCL
However, I want to focus on Mid-Continent Life Insurance Company. MCL was the oldest insurance company incorporated in the State of Oklahoma and was formed by the Stewart family around the time of Statehood.
MCL operated successfully for over 70 years in the traditional life insurance business.
In the late 70's a group of MCL managers designed a new product called "Extra Life" that tried to take advantage of the hyperinflation and inordinately high interest rates caused by the financial mayhem created by the Carter administration. That mayhem is being repeated today by Obama... but that's a story for another day.
The actuary for MCL at the time this product was created was John Crawford. He certified the financial strength of the company, the integrity of the dividends, and the pricing of the products. He did this certification every single year up until 1986. He did this even though the economic circumstances changed during the Regan years to the point that the dividends and the pricing of the product were no longer sustainable.
In 1987, Florida Power bought MCL. Seeing Florida Power's financial resources, Crawford decided to increase his fees tenfold. At this point Crawford was summarily fired.
In the early 90's Crawford ran as a Democrat for congress (I remember meeting Crawford at the park in Crescent on the fourth of July when he was running) and lost. In 1994 he switched parties and rode in on the coattails of Gov. Keating to become the insurance commissioner.
A new management team arrived at MCL in 1995, 18 years after the "Extra Life" product was launched. Within 3 months this new management team discovered the problem of unsustainable dividends and pricing in the product. The management team laid out a course of action to correct the problems in order to maintain the solvency of the company.  In 1996 the point was reached of needing to cut the dividends and raise the rates. This plan was contractually allowed within the provisions of the policy and was later judged by the court to be the proper course of action.
In early 1997, as a standard of protocol, the management team presented the plan to Crawford in a confidential meeting. Four days later MCL's President received a solicitation along with an offer of a bribe from a friend of Crawford's to channel the company to him (the friend) in conjunction with Crawford's support. The MCL President refused and reported the incident to Florida Power officials.
Two months later, Crawford abused his power as commissioner to seize the company. He demanded that Florida Power pay millions of dollars to cover up the financial shortfall that he had mishandled when he was the company actuary. Statements from people at the time of his firing showed this was Crawford's way of getting retribution against Florida Power.
Crawford removed the entire MCL management team and proceeded to try to prosecute them and their lawyers even though none of them designed the product or certified to the financial integrity of the company for the nearly two decades prior to their arrival. That prosecution was ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence.
Each member of the MCL management team went on to establish very successful careers. The President became the Chairman, President & CEO of Chase Insurance, the largest bank insurance enterprise in America.  MCL's general Counsel became the General Counsel for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. He now oversees the legal framework for the entire U.S. insurance industry for every state in the country. The Chief Actuary is now the Chief Actuary of the largest TPA in America. The Chief Financial Officer became the CFO of a large Oklahoma company. The marketing officer became the President of several international insurance companies. This was a superb management team with outstanding credentials and an impeccable record of performance excellence.
Because of John Crawford, MCL no longer exists. Hundreds of Oklahoma jobs were lost. The insurance industry considers Oklahoma a "backwater" for doing business. Florida Power had an opportunity to invest $500 million in a power related industry in Oklahoma. They passed on this investment because of their treatment by Crawford and his cronies. The MCL President had first-hand knowledge that Florida Power shared their dim view of Oklahoma with many of their Fortune 500 friends.
So bottom line, all the headlines of corruption, cronyism and incompetence surrounding John Crawford are vividly real. Oklahoma consumers, the insurance industry, and Oklahoma businesses cannot afford a repeat of Crawford as Insurance Commissioner.
It is imperative to defeat Crawford in this primary runoff on August 24.

Here are Charlie Meadows's comments on the Doak-Crawford runoff:
John Doak has a great deal of experience in a variety of levels in the insurance industry. He is a solid conservative and I believe a man of high moral character and integrity which is a most important qualification for this office. The insurance commissioner has enormous regulatory powers over both small and very large businesses and as such the person must be above reproach.  I believe his opponent, John Crawford to be corrupt, a charlatan and an opportunist. He was the first Republican elected to this position on the coat-tails of Frank Keating's election to governor. During his one term in office, before voters sent him packing in 1998, his office was under numerous allegations of fraud, nepotism, mismanagement and corruption. 

The liberal Democrat Incumbent Kim Holland really wants John Crawford to become the nominee as she will have a field day bringing up all those very serious allegations from the past. She will have a difficult time defeating John Doak, but Crawford is so bad, I will even vote for Holland over Crawford if he is the nominee as the Republican party can not afford to put a suspected crook in office with a "R" by his name.

I'm very happy that John Doak won the run-off.  I'd like to think that Michael's blog with a careful analysis of Mr. Crawford's unsavory reign as former Insurance Commissioner had some influence on those that follow his political commentaries.

            Citizens motion viable in John Crawford case
         

Published: Friday, June 12, 2015 @ 9:32 PM
Updated: Friday, June 12, 2015 @ 9:32 PM









The attorney for John Crawford III’s family or another group could ask a judge to find probable cause against Beavercreek police in the August 2014 fatal shooting at the Beavercreek Walmart, Tom Hagel, University of Dayton School of Law professor emeritus, said Friday. “Theoretically, yes,” he told Dayton Daily News Staff Writer Mark Gokavi, “because double jeopardy is not attached” to the grand jury process. Employing such an strategy led a Cleveland Municipal judge to find probable cause that two police officers broke the law in the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice at a park in November 2014. Local activists known as the “Cleveland 8” sought the citizens motion known as an “affidavit of person having knowledge of offense,” they said, because they had lost confidence in the grand jury investigation. The ruling is only advisory. Whether charges are pursued will be up to Cuyahoga County and Cleveland prosecutors. “In terms of why citizens would do this, again I can’t read their minds, but it might be that, No. 1, it keeps the case alive and in public view,” Hagel said. Crawford, 22, of Fairfield, was shot by Officer Sean Williams, dispatched to the store after a 911 caller said a black male was waving a rifle at people, including children. Crawford had picked up a BB/pellet rifle from an opened box in the store and walked around with it as he talked on his phone. Police said they twice told Crawford to drop the item before Williams fired. On Sept. 25, 2014, a Greene County special grand jury declined to indict Williams on criminal charges. A federal civil lawsuit filed by attorneys representing Crawford’s family against the police officers and Walmart is pending. The Justice Department continues to review the case and hasn’t said whether the government will seek charges.

Teen girl pleads for help in first 911 text call in Miami County

Matthew Weigel






When a teenage girl texted 911 last week to say she was in the car with a 20-year-old man headed down Interstate 75 to buy heroin, it was Miami County Communications Center’s first such call.
It also was exactly the type of situation the text to 911 technology was intended to address, center Director Jeff Busch said Tuesday. The county announced earlier this month it was able to handle texts to 911.
A transcript of the communication on July 22 between the girl, who was a passenger in the car, outlined the back and forth communication as the 16-year-old pleaded for help.
She described the situation and provided information as she traveled in the vehicle driven by Matthew Weigel from Miami County into Harrison Twp.a drug buy and their return up the interstate before being stopped near Tipp City.
"He's on a house arrest bracelet and he's trying to take me to Dayton with him to get heroin … cannot call on the phone," the girl texted. She also reported Weigel said he would lead police on a high-speed chase and wreck the vehicle, if necessary. 
The teen said the man thought she was texting his mother, though later in the transcript she texted he called her a "snitch." 
The interaction lasted around 30 minutes. The vehicle was stopped by the Ohio State Highway Patrol and Tipp City police. Weigel was apprehended without incident. He is in the Miami County Jail on suspicion of a probation violation. 
Miami County commissioners mentioned the successful resolution of the incident during their Tuesday morning meeting. 
Busch earlier told commissioners the technology would be beneficial in certain circumstances, such as when someone was in a house or another situation in which a phone call could endanger the caller. Voice calls are preferred when possible, he said. 
"Obtaining and verifying information can be done more quickly through a voice call. Furthermore, telecommunicators can gain valuable insight into situations by hearing the tone of the caller's voice and listening to background noises through voice calls," Busch said on July 23 when he announced the new technology.

Former high school referee pleads not guilty to rape; judge reduces bond

Henry Lucas (Courtesy/Miami County Sheriff's Office)






TROY – A Troy man and former Ohio High School Athletic Association referee pleaded not guilty today to felony rape in Miami County Common Pleas Court.
Henry A. Lucas, 52, also saw his bail reduced, as requested, following a review by Judge Christopher Gee of a bond check report ordered during the morning arraignment hearing. 
Lucas is accused of sexual conduct involving a teenage girl in Troy in March and attempting to alter evidence against him. He pleaded not guilty to rape and tamping with evidence during arraignment via video from the county jail. 
More than 20 supporters of Lucas were in the courtroom for the hearing. 
Defense lawyer Andy Pratt asked Gee to consider a request for the recognizance bond or to “substantially reduce” Lucas’ bail of $400,000. Pratt said Lucas was a lifelong local resident and would live with his mother, if released. 
“He has tremendous support within the community,” Pratt said, pointing to those attending the hearing. 
Janna Parker, assistant county prosecutor, said prosecutors would request a cash bond for Lucas. She pointed out Lucas has a felony record and spent time in prison. He was convicted of a drug-related offense in 2010. 
Gee signed a bond order Thursday afternoon reducing the bail to $100,000, which can be posted at 10 percent cash or surety. 
Among conditions of the bail, if posted, were that Lucas have no contact with the minor victim, the minor victim's mother and have no unsupervised conduct with minors. 
The bond check was conducted by the adult probation office. 
Lucas was a long-time official for the OHSAA. His license was suspended following his arrest.

Deputies get Freddie Green ready to go back to jail after a mistrial was declared Thursday in Warren County Common Pleas Court.Family and friends filled a section of the courtroom gallery in his support.






A mistrial was declared Thursday in a murder trial in Warren County.
Judge Timothy Tepe declared the mistrial about 3:40 p.m. after the jury - which deliberated about 15 hours - indicated it would not reach a verdict “regardless of the amount of time deliberating.”

Freddie Green, 42, faced charges of murder and felonious assault in connection with the fatal shooting of his father, Sidney Green, 64, on Dec. 2 at a rented home they shared in Lebanon.

The jury began deliberations just before 11 a.m. Wednesday, the third day of the trial in Warren County Common Pleas Court.
Tepe sent them home at 8 p.m. Wednesday. They resumed deliberations about 9:30 a.m. Thursday.
The jury appealed for the first time to Tepe for direction about 11 a.m. Thursday.
“We are unable to reach a consensus and can’t see progress going forward. What should we do?” the jury said in a note sent to the judge.

Tepe read them a statement about continuing to work to decide the case.
“It is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so,” Tepe said, before sending them back for more deliberations.
At 2:30 p.m., the jury again indicated they were deadlocked and asked for the testimony of Lebanon Officer Jeffrey Haller. Tepe allowed the jury to watch a recording of Haller’s testimony, over the objection of defense lawyer Jeff Richards.
Haller took a statement from Green after the shooting.
Reading from the statement on Monday, Haller testified that Green said he waited more than two hours before calling 911.
“He didn’t know what to do and he was scared,” Haller read from a police report.
Green reportedly told Haller he knew his father was dead, couldn’t decide what to do and also considered suicide before calling 911.
Taking the stand on Tuesday, Green admitted he drove to Dayton for heroin during four hours he waited before calling 911.
But Green continued to maintain that he acted in self defense after taking away his father’s 9mm handgun in a bedroom of a rented duplex they shared in Lebanon.
Green said he meant to shoot his father in the shoulder.
There were no other witnesses.
Sidney Green died from a single gunshot wound in the back of the head, fired from two to three feet away, according to evidence presented during the trial.
He was one of six victims of deadly domestic violence in the last half of 2016 in Warren County. Two cases ended homicide-suicides involving both spouses.

In the other case, Mercedes Robb, 35, is scheduled to return to Warren County Common Pleas Court for a hearing on Oct. 3.

Mother writing kids from jail while awaiting trial in ex-husband’s murder


On Nov. 3, 2016, she told a 911 operator she shot her ex-husband to protect her children from him. But no evidence has so far been presented supporting that.
The Robbs were locked in a custody battle, and Jason Robb had cited her diminishing mental condition in a motion seeking full custody.
On Thursday, Green was returned to the county jail, where he has been since Dec. 3.
He faces as much as 15 years to life in prison, if convicted of murder. He has been in jail more than eight months awaiting trial,
After the mistrial was declared, Richards asked for a bond reduction.
Assistant County Prosecutor Steven Knippen said Green remained a danger to the community and flight risk and urged Tepe to leave the bond at $1 million.
Tepe said he would give prosecutors a week to decide whether they would retry the case.
