Shares of Oxford Industries Inc.  fell more than 4% late Tuesday after the clothing company behind brands such as Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer reported adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales below expectations. The company said it earned $17.2 million, or $1.03 a share, in the quarter, compared with $20.2 million, or $1.21 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned $1.12 a share, compared with $1.26 a year ago. Net sales rose to $272.4 million, compared to $256.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of $1.04 a share on sales of $274 million. Oxford Industries said it expects net sales in a range of $285 million to $295 million for the next quarter, compared with net sales of $283 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Shares of Tommy Bahama parent Oxford Industries fall after earnings miss

   No longer all buttoned up, Oxford has embraced the island life. It's a top US maker of brand name and private-label clothing, including golf attire, as well as a retailer in the US and UK. Its Tommy Bahama unit makes branded men's and women's casual attire and owns more than 155 stores and restaurants in the US. Lanier Clothes offers men's suits, sportcoats, and slacks under such brands as Dockers, Geoffrey Beene, and Kenneth Cole. Oxford's newest lifestyle brand is colorful Lilly Pulitzer. Oxford's  customers include national and regional specialty stores, direct retailers, and department stores. Macy's, Nordstrom, and Debenhams are some of its biggest customers.
   Operations

   The company primarily operates through Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Lanier Clothes. With annual sales of about $628 million (nearly two-third of Oxford's total) Tommy Bahama is the company's cash cow. That unit specializes in men's and women's relaxed sportswear, targeting affluent customers age 35 and older. Dainty Lily Pulitzer, with about $168 million in sales, is next. The brand markets its collections to women and girls, with more of a younger slant. Lanier Clothes, which produces tailored and casual men's apparel under license and private-label products, contributes more than 10%.
  

   In 2015, Oxford sold its smallest business, the London-based Ben Sherman, a maker of men's sportswear that attracts style-conscious customers primarily in the UK, Europe, and the US. Ben Sherman contributed 8% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2015.
  

   In addition to apparel manufacturing, Oxford's Tommy Bahama and Lily Pulitzer brands operate company-owned retail and outlet stores -- 206 doors in all. The shops are concentrated in Florida and California. There are also more than a dozen Tommy Bahama-branded restaurants adjacent to Tommy Bahama retail shops.
  
Geographic Reach

   The US is Atlanta-based Oxford's largest market, accounting for more than 90% of its annual sales. International markets account for 10% of sales, which previously consisted of Ben Sherman products in the UK and Europe (Oxford sold Ben Sherman in mid-2015), and Tommy Bahama merchandise in Canada and the Asia/Pacific region.
  

   The company makes apparel at a plant in Merida, Mexico. It has distribution centers and sales offices in Washington, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and New York. Overseas, Oxford has sales offices in Northern Ireland, London, and Hong Kong.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Oxford sells its apparel on a wholesale basis to department stores and national chains, warehouse clubs, discount and specialty retailers, and other customers across the US. Its Lanier Clothes branded products are sold in more than 5,000 stores.
  

   The Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands are marketed via print media such as catalogs, online (including social media), and through trade shows.
  
Financial Performance

   Since 2011, revenues have been on the rise: Net sales in fiscal 2015 (ended January) were 60% higher than they were in 2011. Increased sales of the Lilly Pulitzer and Ben Sherman brands led to a 9% increase to $997.8 million in 2015. Lilly Pulitzer sales grew as a result of such initiatives as e-commerce clearance sales and the opening of new stores. Ben Sherman sales (which had declined in 2014) increased both in stores and online.
  

   Net income, which has also been rising as of late, climbed 1% to $45.7 million in fiscal 2015 on higher sales, which were ultimately offset by increased expenses related to opening new stores and restaurants and the payment of incentive compensation. Over the same period, cash flow from operations rose 81% to $95.4 million.
  
Strategy

   Oxford's strategy is to develop strong lifestyle brands with which consumers around the world can connect. For example, it is expanding its Tommy Bahama business to be available in upscale shopping malls, resorts, and other appropriate locations. It also limits the amount of sales promotions offered in its full-price retail locations and online in order to maintain brand integrity.
  

   In mid-2015, the company sold the Ben Sherman business for $63.7 million. The divestiture came after the brand brought a loss from operations of $10.8 million.

Oxford Industries, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended April 29, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter Ending July 29, 2017; Revised Earnings Guidance for the Fiscal Year 2017
Jun 6 17
Oxford Industries, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net sales of $272,363,000 compared to $256,235,000 a year ago. This increase was driven by the addition of the Southern Tide business, new stores and Tommy Bahama’s strong comparable store sales. Operating income was $29,959,000 compared to $32,006,000 a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $29,029,000 compared to $31,392,000 a year ago. Net earnings from continuing operations were $17,197,000 or $1.03 per diluted share compared to $20,177,000 or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago. Net earnings were $17,197,000 or $1.03 per diluted share compared to $20,177,000 or $1.21 per diluted share a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $13,611,000 compared to $1,697,000 a year ago. Purchases of property and equipment were $8,545,000 compared to $10,582,000 a year ago. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $32.1 million compared to $33.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. On an adjusted basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $18.7 million or $1.12 per diluted share compared to $21.0 million or $1.26 per diluted share a year ago.


The company initiated its guidance for the second quarter ending July 29, 2017.  The company expects net sales in a range from $285 million to $295 million compared to net sales of $283.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis are expected to be in a range of $1.33 to $1.43 in the second quarter.  On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 are expected to be in a range of $1.35 to $1.45.


The company has affirmed its adjusted earnings outlook for the full year fiscal 2017 and has revised its GAAP earnings outlook due to the impact of LIFO accounting.  GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $3.33 and $3.53. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $3.50 and $3.70. This compares to earnings on a GAAP basis of $3.27 per share and, on an adjusted basis, $3.30 per share in fiscal 2016.  The company now expects net sales to grow to between $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion as compared to fiscal 2016 net sales of $1.023 billion. The company’s effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 39% compared to 37% in the full 2016 fiscal year, with the increase reflecting the unfavorable impact of the vesting of stock awards and a reduction in the utilization of operating loss carryforwards relative to fiscal 2016.  Full year interest expense is estimated to be approximately $3.5 million. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017, including $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, are expected to be in a range of $50 million to $55 million, primarily reflecting investments in information technology initiatives, new retail stores and restaurants, and investments to remodel and relocate existing retail stores.

well as company owned retail stores and e-commerce websites. Additionally, we

Tommy Bahama retail stores. Our branded and private label tailored clothing 
products are distributed through department stores, specialty stores, national 
chains, specialty catalogs, mass merchants and Internet retailers. Originally

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
