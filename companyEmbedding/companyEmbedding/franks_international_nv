Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Frank's International N.V. (NYSE:FI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Sell Ratings, 9 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.69)Consensus Price Target: $10.15 (22.73% upside)

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" included in this Form 10-K.  This section contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements because of various factors, including those described in the sections titled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Overview of Business  We are a global provider of highly engineered tubular services, tubular fabrication and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions to the oil and gas industry and have been in business for over 75 years. We provide our services to leading exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments, with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells.  We conduct our business through four operating segments:   International Services. We currently provide our services in approximately 60 countries on six continents. Our customers in these international markets are primarily large exploration and production companies, including integrated oil and gas companies and national oil and gas companies.   U.S. Services. We service customers in the offshore areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we have a presence in the active onshore oil and gas drilling regions in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, Marcellus Shale, DJ Basin and Utica Shale.   Tubular Sales. We design, manufacture and distribute large OD pipe, connectors and casing attachments and sell large OD pipe originally manufactured by various pipe mills. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of offshore projects, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 300 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. This segment also designs and manufactures proprietary equipment for use in our International and U.S. Services segments.   Blackhawk. We provide well construction and well intervention rental equipment, services and products, in addition to cementing tool expertise, in the U.S. and Mexican Gulf of Mexico, onshore U.S. and other select international locations.  How We Generate Our Revenue  The majority of our services revenues are derived primarily from personnel rates for our specially trained employees who perform tubular and other well construction services for our customers; and rental rates for the suite of products and equipment that our employees use to perform these services.  In addition, our customers typically reimburse us for transportation costs that we incur in connection with transporting our products and equipment from our staging areas to the customers' job sites.  In contrast, our Tubular Sales revenues are derived from sales of certain products, including large OD pipe connectors and large OD pipe manufactured by third parties, directly to external customers.  The acquisition of Blackhawk resulted in a new segment for us. Our Blackhawk revenues are derived from well construction and well intervention rental equipment, services and products. These revenues have historically been split evenly between sold and rented products or equipment with certain rented products having a service element for personnel overseeing the operation of the equipment.  Outlook  We expect to see improvement in the oil field services industry in 2017 as global capital spending on oil and natural gas exploration and production is likely to increase modestly in response to higher commodity prices. However, much of the anticipated increase in spending will likely be associated with onshore projects that contribute lower revenue and margins to the Company than offshore projects. Material increases in activity in the deep and ultra-deep offshore markets are not expected until further improvement in oil and natural gas prices are seen and, in some basins, may continue to deteriorate. We have made efforts to reduce the impact of the lower activity levels by reducing costs, but additional actions may be necessary if we continue to see decreased investment in global offshore projects.  Our offshore businesses, both in the U.S. and internationally, continue to see delays and cancellations as customers reduce spending or elect to reallocate financial resources to other onshore projects. These delays or cancellations have been more prevalent in the deep and ultra-deep water markets where our services are most profitable. In areas where new projects are being sanctioned, we have seen increased competition and awarded tenders often are secured at prices below historical levels. Our efforts to grow market share in the underrepresented offshore shelf market are expected to support revenues, but are unlikely to fully offset declines in the deep and ultra-deep water.  Our onshore operations are expected to see sequential improvement, particularly in the U.S. onshore market, as drilling activity has risen meaningfully in recent months. The increase in demand for our services combined with a leaner cost structure is expected to result in higher revenues and improved profitability for this business in the coming year.  The Tubular Sales business is driven by specialized needs of our customers and the timing of projects, specifically in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to steep declines in activity in the Gulf of Mexico and low visibility on forthcoming orders for these services, we anticipate that revenues associated with this segment will trend lower until additional projects are sanctioned and commence operations.  The Blackhawk product and service lines face similar challenges in the offshore market as our tubular services business. Blackhawk revenues are primarily generated offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and are at risk if activity levels were to decrease further. However, we will benefit from a full year of operations from Blackhawk in 2017, which will likely help drive our total revenues sequentially higher.  Overall, our market outlook is mixed as the onshore begins to lead the recovery, but the offshore market lags as prices remain below economic break-even levels for many projects. We remain in a very strong position financially with a significant cash balance relative to our debt.  How We Evaluate Our Operations  We use a number of financial and operational measures to routinely analyze and evaluate the performance of our business, including revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and safety performance.  Revenue  We analyze our revenue growth by comparing actual monthly revenue to our internal projections for each month to assess our performance. We also assess incremental changes in our monthly revenue across our operating segments to identify potential areas for improvement.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit or expense, asset impairments, gain or loss on sale of assets, foreign currency gain or loss, equity-based compensation, unrealized gain or loss, other non-cash adjustments and other charges or credits. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of our revenues. We review Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin on both a consolidated basis and on a segment basis. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to assess our financial performance because it allows us to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), items outside the control of our management team (such as income tax and foreign currency exchange rates) and other charges outside the normal course of business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, our most directly comparable GAAP performance measure, as well as adjusted EBITDA margin for each of the periods presented (in thousands):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net income (loss) $ (156,079 ) $ 106,110 $ 229,312 Interest income, net (2,073 ) (341 ) (87 ) Depreciation and amortization 114,215 108,962 90,041 Income tax (benefit) expense (25,643 ) 37,319 75,412 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 1,117 (1,038 ) 289 Foreign currency loss 10,819 6,358 17,041 Charges and credits (1) 82,675 61,716 39,505 Adjusted EBITDA $ 25,031 $ 319,086 $ 451,513 Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.1 % 32.7 % 39.2 %  (1) Comprised of Equity-based compensation expense (2016:$15)(2016:978)(2015:$26)(2015:318)(2014:$38)(2014:368), Merger and acquisition costs (2016:$13)(2016:784)(2015:none)(2014:none), Severance and other charges (2016: $46,406; 2015: $35,484; 2014:  Safety Performance  Maintaining a strong safety record is a critical component of our operational success. Many of our customers have safety standards we must satisfy before we can perform services. As a result, we continually monitor and improve our safety performance through the evaluation of safety observations, job and customer surveys, and safety data. In addition, we continually develop new safety programs based on industry trends and our internal data. The primary measure for our safety performance is the tracking of the Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR"). TRIR is a measure of the rate of recordable workplace injuries, normalized on the basis of 100 full time employees for an annual period. The factor is derived by multiplying the number of recordable injuries in a calendar year by 200,000 and dividing this value by the total hours actually worked in the year. A recordable injury includes occupational death, nonfatal occupational illness, and other occupational injuries that involve loss of consciousness, lost time injuries, restriction of work or motion cases, transfer to another job, or medical treatment cases other than first aid.  The table below presents our worldwide TRIR for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:  TRIR 0.87 0.76 1.27  Results of Operations  The following table presents our consolidated results for the periods presented (in thousands):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenues: Equipment rentals and services $ 397,369 $ 766,252 $ 969,703 Products (1) 90,162 208,348 182,929 Total revenue 487,531 974,600 1,152,632 Operating expenses: Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization Equipment rentals and services 201,316 304,473 369,855 Products 59,037 113,918 110,126 General and administrative expenses 228,802 270,678 267,378 Depreciation and amortization 114,215 108,962 90,041 Severance and other charges 46,406 35,484 - Changes in contingent consideration - (1,532 ) - Gain (loss) on sale of assets 1,117 (1,038 ) 289 Operating income (loss) (163,362 ) 143,655 314,943 Other income (expense): Other income 4,170 5,791 6,735 Interest income, net 2,073 341 87 Merger and acquisition costs (13,784 ) - - Foreign currency loss (10,819 ) (6,358 ) (17,041 ) Total other income (expense) (18,360 ) (226 ) (10,219 ) Income (loss) before income tax (benefit) (181,722 ) 143,429 304,724 Income tax expense (benefit) (25,643 ) 37,319 75,412 Net income (loss) (156,079 ) 106,110 229,312 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest (20,741 ) 27,000 70,275 Net income (loss) attributable to Frank's International N.V. $ (135,338 ) $ 79,110 $ 159,037  (1) Consolidated products revenue includes a small amount of revenues attributable to the U.S. Services, International Services and Blackhawk segments.  Consolidated Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015  Revenues. Revenues from external customers, excluding intersegment sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $487.1 million, or 50.0%, to $487.5 million from $974.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in the majority of our segments due to declining activity as depressed oil and gas prices resulted in reduced rig count, downward pricing pressures, rig cancellations and delays as well as deferred work scopes in the International and U.S. Services regions while revenues for Tubular Sales decreased  due to lower international demand and decreased deep water fabrication revenue. The decreased revenues were partially offset by revenues in our Blackhawk segment of $10.0 million resulting from our acquisition in November 2016. See Note 3 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our Blackhawk acquisition. Revenues for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Operating Segment Results."  Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $158.0 million, or 37.8%, to $260.4 million from $418.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to lower activity volumes, offset by cost actions taken throughout 2016. We also incurred additional costs of $8.9 million related to our Blackhawk acquisition in November 2016.  General and administrative expenses. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $41.9 million, or 15.5%, to $228.8 million from $270.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the bad debt expense of $11.3 million related primarily to the collectability of receivables in Venezuela (see "Customer Credit Risk" in Part II, Item 7A) and the bankrupt customer in Nigeria, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $53.2 million, or 19.7%, primarily as a result of declining activity and pricing pressures, offset by internal cost initiatives, which included workforce reductions and lease terminations. Also, equity-based compensation expense decreased by $10.3 million as the IPO grants for retirement-eligible employees had a two year service requirement, which was completed during the third quarter of 2015. The decreased costs were partially offset by an increase in professional fees, which included costs related to our ongoing global corporate initiatives and the investigation mentioned in Note 20 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5.3 million, or 4.8%, to $114.2 million from $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to our Timco and Blackhawk acquisitions as well as a higher depreciable base resulting from property and equipment additions.  Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $46.4 million as we continued to take steps to adjust our workforce to meet the depressed demand in the industry in addition to the retirement of fixed assets of $29.9 million. See Note 19 - Severance and Other Charges in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which affected the following segments: International Services ($12.2 million), U.S. Services ($33.7 million) and Tubular Sales ($0.6 million).  Merger and acquisition costs. Merger and acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $13.8 million as a result of our Blackhawk acquisition as mentioned in Note 3 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Foreign currency loss. Foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $4.5 million to $10.8 million from $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira.  Income tax expense (benefit). Income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $63.0 million, or 168.7%, to $(25.6) million from $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in taxable income and a change in jurisdictional mix. We are subject to many U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and many tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities. Our operations in these jurisdictions are taxed on various bases such as income before taxes, deemed profits (which is generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits) and withholding taxes based on revenues; consequently, the relationship between our pre-tax income from operations and our income tax provision varies from period to period.  Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014  Revenues. Revenues from external customers, excluding intersegment sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $178.0 million, or 15.4%, to $974.6 million from $1,152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in our U.S. Services and International segments with revenues  decreasing $113.2 million and $95.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of declining rig count as well as downward pricing pressures, which were driven by depressed oil and gas prices. Additionally, there were some weather related delays in the Gulf of Mexico. The decreased revenues were partially offset by increased revenues in our Tubular Sales segment of $30.3 million as a result of project related orders and being able to meet urgent unscheduled customer requests for products. Revenue for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading "Operating Segment Results."  Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $61.6 million, or 12.8%, to $418.4 million from $480.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower activity and cost reduction efforts taken throughout the year, which caused a decrease in compensation-related costs of $34.8 million, product costs of $17.4 million and field supplies of $7.5 million.  General and administrative expenses. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $3.3 million, or 1.2%, to $270.7 million from $267.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of higher compensation-related costs of $11.5 million as a result of continuing to build and optimize the human resource infrastructure to support a public company and professional fees of $9.6 million due to acquisition costs and strategic initiatives to optimize and further develop various corporate functions. The increases were partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million as the six months ended June 30, 2014 included an out-of-period adjustment of $7.5 million, which corrected the amortization of expense related to retirement-eligible employees (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail) in addition to lower other taxes of $4.0 million.  Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $18.9 million, or 21.0%, to $109.0 million from $90.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to our Timco acquisition of $8.3 million as well as a higher depreciable base resulting from property and equipment additions.  Severance and other charges. Severance and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $35.5 million as a result of the transition of a key executive to a non-executive member of the Supervisory Board, workforce reductions, base rationalization and lease termination fees, which affected the following segments: International Services ($1.5 million), U.S. Services ($32.8 million) and Tubular Sales ($1.2 million).  Foreign currency loss. Foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $10.7 million to $6.4 million from $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to foreign currency losses in Venezuela of $13.0 million in 2014 and other changes caused by non-local currency working capital specifically in Norway, Brazil, the United Kingdom and the Eurozone.  Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $38.1 million, or 50.5%, to $37.3 million from $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of a decrease in taxable income. We are subject to many U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and many tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities. Our operations in these jurisdictions are taxed on various bases such as income before taxes, deemed profits (which is generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits), and withholding taxes based on revenues; consequently, the relationship between our pre-tax income from operations and our income tax provision varies from period to period.  Operating Segment Results The following table presents revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by segment (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenue: International Services $ 237,275 $ 442,861 $ 538,730 U.S. Services 172,417 352,281 463,372 Tubular Sales 106,971 241,983 240,277 Blackhawk 9,982 - - Intersegment sales (39,114 ) (62,525 ) (89,747 ) Total $ 487,531 $ 974,600 $ 1,152,632 Segment Adjusted EBITDA: (1) International Services $ 33,264 $ 182,475 $ 231,469 U.S. Services (11,490 ) 95,516 181,712 Tubular Sales 1,741 40,999 38,366 Blackhawk 1,038 - - Total 24,553 318,990 451,547  (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. (For a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA, see "-Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin."  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015  International Services  Revenue for the International Services segment decreased by $205.6 million, or 46.4%, compared to 2015, primarily due to depressed oil and gas prices, which challenged the economics of current development projects and caused the termination of ongoing drilling campaigns and the delay in the commencement of new projects, as well as cancellations or deferred work scopes.  Adjusted EBITDA for the International Services segment decreased by $149.2 million, or 81.8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the $205.6 million decrease in revenue and $11.3 million of bad debt expense related to the collectability of receivables in Venezuela (see "Customer Credit Risk" in Part II, Item 7A) and Nigeria, which were partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced activity and cost-cutting measures.  U.S. Services  Revenue for the U.S. Services segment decreased by $179.9 million, or 51.1%, compared to 2015 primarily due to depressed oil and gas prices. Onshore services revenue decreased by $51.3 million as a result of lower activity from declining rig counts and pricing discounts. The offshore business saw a decrease in revenue of $125.9 million as a result of overall lower activity from weaknesses seen in the Gulf of Mexico due to rig cancellations and delays, coupled with downward pricing pressures.  Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. Services segment decreased by $107.0 million, or 112.0%, compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pricing concessions and lower activity of $94.6 million and higher corporate and other costs of $12.4 million primarily due to increased professional fees, which were attributable to ongoing global corporate initiatives.  Tubular Sales  Revenue for the Tubular Sales segment decreased by $135.0 million, or 55.8%, compared to 2015, primarily as a result of lower international demand and decreased deep water fabrication revenue.  Adjusted EBITDA for the Tubular Sales segment decreased by $39.3 million, or 95.8%, compared to 2015, as it was negatively impacted by fixed costs associated with the manufacturing division and decreased revenues.  Blackhawk  The Blackhawk segment is comprised solely of our acquisition on November 1, 2016. Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the segment were $10.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 3 - Acquisitions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our Blackhawk acquisition.  . . .  Feb 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.10      Net Money Flow ($)  131,299    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Announces First Quarter 2017 ResultsGlobeNewswire•May 2, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareRevenue of $111 million, up 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter 2016U.S. onshore revenues up 16% sequentiallyStrong growth in West Africa and Latin America drove International segment revenues higher 2% sequentiallyHOUSTON, May 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Frank’s International N.V. (FI) (the “Company” or “Frank’s”) today reported revenues of $110.7 million and net loss of $26.7 million, or $0.12 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 million or 1.4% of revenue. “The increase in U.S. onshore rig activity continues to benefit our U.S. Services and Blackhawk segments, and our International business is beginning to show signs of improvement,” said Douglas Stephens, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer.“We still face headwinds in our U.S. offshore and Tubulars Sales businesses as decreased activity and lower prices for our services persist. However, we remain diligent in evaluating and identifying opportunities to lower our costs and expand our products and services to underrepresented markets to offset some of these declines.”“We also maintain a strong balance sheet that we believe will offer us the flexibility to broaden our well construction offering through acquisitions and grow our revenue per rig potential. As we progress through 2017, we are focused on providing our customers with safe, quality and reliable service and positioning the Company for a return to sustained profitability and cash flow in the eventual market recovery.”First Quarter 2017 Results• Revenue was $110.7 million, up 2.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 27.9% compared to the first quarter of 2016.International Services revenue was $46.6 million, up 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 43.9% year-over-yearU.S. Services revenue was $31.0 million, down 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 36.5% year-over-yearTubular Sales revenue was $16.9 million, down 12.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 21.7% year-over-yearBlackhawk revenue was $16.2 million, up 62.4% compared to the full months of November and December 2016• Cash flow used in operations was $9.4 million for the first quarter 2017Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and segment adjusted EBITDA, which are financial measures not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), are defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. Please see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures.Segment ResultsInternational ServicesInternational Services revenue was $46.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 43.9% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Sequential results were impacted by increased work scope in West Africa and increased activity in Latin America and Canada, partially offset by delays in the commencement of certain projects in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions.Segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 of $5.3 million, or 11.3% of revenue, was up 249.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 83.2% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially due to higher West Africa revenues and lower costs in the segment.U.S. ServicesU.S. Services revenue was $31.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, down 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 36.5% compared to the first quarter of 2016.For the first quarter, onshore revenue within the U.S. Services segment of $11.2 million was up 16.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and up 4.8% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Sequential and year-over-year revenue increases were a result of increased rig activity and improved pricing of services.Offshore revenue within the U.S. Services segment of $19.8 million for the first quarter was down 15.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 48.1% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Revenue decreased year-over-year and sequentially due to a decline in working rig count activity and lost work from aggressive competitive pricing.Segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a loss of $7.2 million, down $9.2 million from the fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was lower due to fewer one-time benefits from the previous quarter, one-time employee healthcare claims expense in the first quarter and loss of high margin offshore work in the Gulf of Mexico.Tubular SalesTubular Sales revenue was $16.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, down 12.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 21.7% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Revenue experienced declines from lower Gulf of Mexico volumes due to decreased demand.Segment adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.3 million, or 13.3% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBTIDA margin were higher due to lower realized costs from actions taken in 2016.Read MoreBlackhawkBlackhawk revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $16.2 million compared to $10.0 million for the full months of November and December 2016. Segment adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.2 million or 7.5% of revenue.Offshore revenue during the quarter was $9.5 million and onshore revenue was $6.7 million for the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Blackhawk onshore business reported record revenues for product sales during the first quarter of 2017.ReclassificationsEffective January 1, 2017, the Company changed the classification of certain direct and indirect costs previously classified and reported as general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses to cost of revenues (“COR”). The change will better reflect management’s philosophy in assessing performance and allocating resources, as well as improve comparability to the Company’s peer group. The reclassification of COR and G&A expenses has no net impact to the condensed consolidated statements of income or to total segment reporting and has been reflected retrospectively for all periods present in this release as well as the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC.In addition, previously reported adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 has been adjusted for employee stock purchase plan expense and matters related to the investigation announced in June 2016 and further described in our public filings. Management believes removing the effect of these items allows for better comparability across periods.Capital Expenditures and Liquidity Capital expenditures were $11.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s consolidated cash balance at March 31, 2017 was $283.9 million compared to $319.5 million at December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the company had no outstanding indebtedness and $3.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under its $100 million credit facility.Dividends and Share Repurchase ProgramThe Company expects that its Board of Managing Directors (the “Management Board”), with the approval from the Board of Supervisory Directors of the Company (the “Supervisory Board”, and jointly with the Management Board, the “Boards”) will, at the next scheduled meeting of the Supervisory Board on May 19, 2017, declare a cash dividend of $0.075 per share (subject to applicable Dutch dividend withholding tax) to all common stockholders of record as of June 2, 2017, and with a payment date on June 16, 2017, as part of its regular quarterly cash dividend program. As customary, any declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the determination by the Boards and no assurances can be given that any such dividend will be declared as expected.Conference CallThe Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter results on Tuesday, May 2, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management’s experience, expectations and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law, and we caution you not to rely on them unduly.About Frank’s InternationalFrank’s International N.V. is a global oil services company that provides a broad and comprehensive range of highly engineered tubular running services, tubular fabrication, and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells. Founded in 1938, Frank’s has approximately 3,000 employees and provides services to leading exploration and production companies in both onshore and offshore environments in approximately 60 countries on six continents. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “FI.”  Additional information is available on the Company’s website, www.franksinternational.com.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release and the accompanying schedules include the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, which may be used periodically by management when discussing the Company’s financial results with investors and analysts. The accompanying schedules of this press release provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin are presented because management believes these metrics provide additional information relative to the performance of the Company’s business. These metrics are commonly employed by financial analysts and investors to evaluate the operating and financial performance of the Company from period to period and to compare it with the performance of other publicly traded companies within the industry. You should not consider adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Because adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin may be defined differently by other companies in the Company’s industry, the Company’s presentation of adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, segment adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.The Company defines adjusted earnings (loss) per share as earnings (loss) per share before severance and other charges, net of tax and merger and acquisition costs, net of tax. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before net interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit or expense, asset impairments, gain or loss on sale of assets, foreign currency gain or loss, equity-based compensation, other non-cash adjustments and unusual charges. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows the Company to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of its capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of the Company’s management team (such as income tax rates). The Company defines adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.Please see the accompanying financial tables for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.
