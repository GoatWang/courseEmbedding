			Anil Singhal co-founded the Company in June 1984 and has served as NetScout's Chief Executive Officer and as a director on NetScout's Board since inception. In January 2007, Mr. Singhal was appointed Chairman of the Board, and has been serving as NetScout's President, CEO and Chairman since that time. In his current role, Mr. Singhal is focused on providing strategic leadership and vision, as well as setting operational priorities for NetScout's management team. Mr. Singhal's vision of "traffic-based instrumentation" has guided NetScout's product direction and focus for the past three decades, helping to shape the evolution for the industry in the process. Under Mr. Singhal's leadership, NetScout has grown substantially during the past three decades, completing its initial public offering in 1999, acquiring the Danaher Communications Business in 2015 for $2.3 billion and exceeding $955 million in revenue in fiscal year 2016 and non-GAAP revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. He is credited with numerous innovations in the field of network traffic monitoring and analysis that have helped NetScout gain several industry accolades. During the past decade, Mr. Singhal has also been an instrumental part of a number of strategic acquisitions that have fortified and enhanced NetScout's technology, customer base and go-to-market capabilities. Mr. Singhal has earned notable recognition for his entrepreneurial success, including the TiE (The Indus Entrepreneur) Boston Lifetime Achievement in 2013, Enterprise Bank's 2013 George L. Duncan Award of Excellence and Ernst & Young's New England Entrepreneur of the Year in 1997. Mr. Singhal holds a BSEE from BITS, Pilani, India and an MS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that Mr. Singhal's experience serving as the Company's Chief Executive Officer since the Company's founding combined with his business expertise, industry-specific knowledge and technical know-how qualify him to serve as a director of the Company.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
