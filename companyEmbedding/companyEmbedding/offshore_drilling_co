BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production



Exploration and Production






BP’s oil and gas exploration and production division is one of its core businesses, globally and in the United States. Teams in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and onshore areas of the lower 48 states are responsible for finding and safely extracting the energy resources America needs.
Gulf of Mexico
Nearly three decades after BP began exploring the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the company remains one of the region’s leading oil and gas producers, with lease blocks covering an area more than twice the size of Delaware. In fact, BP has been the largest energy investor in the deepwater Gulf over the past decade.
Between 2013 and 2015, its average daily production in the region increased from 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 249,000. This reflects BP’s continued investment at its four massive Gulf of Mexico production platforms: Atlantis, Na Kika, Thunder Horse and Mad Dog. Elsewhere in the gulf, the company holds interests in four hubs that other companies operate: Mars, Olympus, Ursa and Great White.
Alaska
BP has spent more than half a century exploring and developing Alaska’s oil and gas resources, and its operations in and around the giant Prudhoe Bay field, located on the North Slope, account for around 55 percent of the state’s oil and gas production.
Since Prudhoe Bay began production in 1977, it has generated more than 12 billion barrels of oil — far exceeding initial projections — thanks in part to enhanced oil recovery technologies that BP pioneered. Four decades after starting up, Prudhoe Bay remains one of North America’s largest oil fields.
Lower 48
In the lower 48 states, BP’s onshore business now is independently operated but still wholly owned. BP chose to separate its lower 48 operations so they could be more flexible and agile, and thus more competitive, in a rapidly changing environment.
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey. In 2015, BP’s average daily oil and gas production in the Lower 48 was about 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent.













Alaska
Alaska remains one of BP’s leading resource basins. After more than 36 years of production, the North Slope still has a large amount of the discovered oil and gas remaining.














Gulf of Mexico
BP and its heritage companies have been at work in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1950s, and it has been exploring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (depths greater than 1,200 feet) for more than a quarter century.














U.S. Lower 48
The U.S. Lower 48 business has significant activities producing natural gas, NGLs and condensate across seven states, including production from unconventional gas, coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas assets.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

Offshore drilling includes services related to drilling wells including type of the rig required, depth and direction of well to be dug and services and expertise required to accomplish the desired goal. Offshore drilling market is estimated to be $78.57 Billion in 2014 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 4.54% from 2015 to 2020. Crude oil prices which have witnessed a sharp decline in the last one year are expected to increase to USD 80/ barrel by 2018. This rebound in oil price will be spurred by the delay in capacity addition as the oil & gas companies are currently shelving new projects to reduce their capital expenditure. With the increase in the price of crude oil, the investments for E&P activities will also increase which will lead to new projects in regions that are looking to overturn their production decline such as Europe and Asia-Pacific. This will in turn create further demand for the offshore drilling in these regions.

The increase in the global oil and gas production in North America and the Middle East accompanied by the maturing onshore oilfields shifted the focus of operators towards offshore for new E&P activities. However, due to the recent crude oil price slump, offshore drilling companies will see weaker revenues over the next few quarters. This downfall is a result of the spending cuts and increase in demand for better pricing and terms of the contract negotiations and renewals. Offshore drilling companies are likely to face a dip in the demand and pricing for services. These companies are therefore trying to capitalize on scale, improve their operational efficiency and their cost bases.
Global offshore drilling market is expected to grow from USD 78.6 Billion in 2014 to USD 89.8 Billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 4.54% during 2015-2020. Asia-Pacific accounted for the largest market share in 2014 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.49% during 2015-2020.
Offshore drilling market has been classified on the basis of applications such as shallow water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater based operations.

Nearly half of the offshore drilling market is covered by shallow water applications, but with the advent of advanced technology, the operators are entering into deepwater and ultra-deepwater zones. Moreover, due to decreasing production in shallow water basins, the large potential of untapped subsea hydrocarbon reserves is driving increased focus in deep water drilling. There have been increasing deep water oil discoveries in India, Africa, Australia, the U.S., Russia, and Norway. Oil discoveries in Africa especially in Ghana, Congo, Mozambique, and Angola are creating lucrative business opportunities where offshore drilling market players are trying to focus to enhance their revenue.
Offshore drilling market has also been classified on the basis of service type into offshore contract drilling, directional drilling, logging-while-drilling and measurement while drilling. More than half of the offshore drilling market is captured by offshore contract drilling services. The market is also witnessing an increase in directional drilling. However due to continuous decline of oil price since mid-2014, the market has witnessed a drastic setback leading to retirement/cold stacking of many of the rigs and delay in the delivery of new rigs. Several operators have either cancelled or postponed their contracts leading to lower day rates.
Asia-Pacific is the leading market in the offshore drilling owing to the offshore activities taking place in South China Sea. China, Thailand, India, Australia and Indonesia are mainly driving growth of the offshore drilling market in the region. Also, Liberalization of Mexican oil & gas industry is another key driver fueling the demand for offshore drilling market in South America. Mexico is one of the largest non-OPEC oil producers in the world. With the liberalization, state run monopoly has ended, paving way for foreign E&P companies.

The recent downturn in the crude oil prices has resulted in the decline of the exploration & production (E&P) activities all over the world. As offshore drilling is highly capital intensive industry, it was affected more as compared to onshore drilling industry. Many contracts were cancelled, postponed, or reworked by companies for rigs. Rigs still in operation are operating on very low dayrates compared to the rates in 2013-14.The current expenditure in E&P has fallen since 2014 but the current capacity reduction is expected to resolve the current demand and supply imbalance of oil and gas. Thus, the price of oil and gas is expected to rise in the future amounting to more capital expenditure on oil and gas E&P activities. As a result, the expected increase in the demand for energy in the future is expected to push the need for optimum exploration & production, thus boosting the demand for the offshore drilling across the globe.

Operations | Offshore Products

Print | Share this pageOffshore ProductsDeepwater Capital Equipment ProviderOil States Industries has provided innovative technologies and industry-changing advancements for over seven decades. We design, manufacture and sell capital equipment utilized on floating production systems, subsea pipelines, offshore drilling rigs and vessels which is driven by investments in global deepwater production infrastructure. We are a worldwide leader in developing and providing flexible bearings and connectors for the most advanced floating and subsea structures, including drilling rigs, subsea pipelines and production platforms. We pioneered the modern methods for installing and leveling fixed platforms, and we developed the technology that has become the connector of choice for platform tethers, conductor casing, rigid risers and subsea pipelines. We primarily manufacture our products in Arlington, Houston and Lampasas, Texas; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houma, Louisiana; Aberdeen, Scotland, Singapore, India, Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil. We have additional sales and other supporting service locations in Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, England, France, Nigeria, Scotland, and in the UAE.Production Platform ProductsWe design, manufacture, supply and service connectors and cranes for floating deepwater production platforms including tension leg platforms (TLP's), floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSO's), and SPAR's. Our connector products facilitate the production and export processes on the platform and, in the case of TLP's, help moor the platform to the seabed. Our connector products, including the FlexJoint® and Merlin™ connectors, are well accepted solutions in the industry and are semi-proprietary. In addition to connectors, we provide fairleads and winches in addition to light-duty platform cranes under the brand names Nautilus and SMATCO. We have one of the largest installed bases of any OEM in the offshore oilfield service industry.Connector ProductsOur FlexJoints® are installed on production and export risers of floating production systems. The increase in deepwater production has increased the demand for steel catenary risers (SCR) to transport the hydrocarbons (1) from the subsea wellheads to the production facility and (2) from the facility to the export pipelines. Manufactured from a combination of forged steel and elastomeric elements, our SCR FlexJoint® reduces the motion-induced stresses between a floating offshore facility and the riser. FlexJoints are capable of providing a free angular rotation ±20°, withstanding pressures in excess of 10,000 psi and axial tensions up to 3,500 kips. Our Merlin™ and TLE connectors improve the efficiency of installing TLP mooring connectors by limiting the number of offshore welds necessary to install the risers. Commercialized in 1991 with the installation on the Exxon Augur platform, the Merlin™ TLE connector was the first developed non-rotational connector for use in anchor tendons of TLP's. With circumferential teeth rather than helical threads, the Merlin™ connector is made-up and broken out by separating the teeth using hydraulic pressure. The use of Merlin™ connectors provides for installation efficiencies as the make-up time for Merlin™ connectors is a fraction of the time necessary to weld tendons or pipe offshore, reducing offshore vessel time and expenditures for operators during platform installation.Pipeline ProductsOil States Industries, Inc., Houston operations division is a leading manufacturer of subsea pipeline equipment for new construction, repairs and expansion of existing lines. Products include collet connectors, remote articulating connectors, valve products, pipeline end manifolds and terminations, tie in sleds and wye blocks. These products are essential for efficient flow of gas and oil products through the pipeline network from the well site to the production or refining facility. All pipeline products meet rigorous industry testing standards and have been proven to perform in the harshest, deepwater environments. Oil States also supplies pipeline repair products for repair of damaged pipelines in both shallow water and deepwater environments. Typical shallow water spool piece repair components include ball flanges, swivel ring flanges and GripLock™ mechanical end connectors. These products are manufactured on a quick turn-around basis to facilitate expedited repairs and reduce downtime. The Leak Repair Clamp (LRC) is available where damage is isolated to a smaller area and allows the pipeline to remain in service during the repair process. A modified version, called the HydroTap™, accommodates pipeline expansion and creates a tie-in point while the line is still flowing. The Deepwater Pipeline Repair System (DPRS) is utilized when a larger section of the pipeline must be replaced and requires remotely operated vehicle (ROV) interface due to water depth. Drilling Rig ProductsThrough our Arlington and Houston, Texas and Houma, Louisiana facilities, we provide several products for floating drilling rigs. Our product line includes semi-submersible rig mooring systems and winches and drilling riser FlexJoints®. We also integrate blow-out preventer (BOP) systems and controls and fabricate coiled tubing and BOP lifting frames. Through our Brazil, Singapore and UK locations, we provide drilling riser repair and storage services.Our Oil States Industries subsidiary also produces elastomer and connector products used in the onshore oil and gas industry as well as defense and aerospace industries. Trusted Source of InnovationOil States invented the now standard method for installing and leveling fixed platforms.Oil States designed the first non-rotating, snap-on connections for TLP tethers, conductor casings, risers and subsea pipelines.Oil States introduced a breakthrough FlexJoint® technology as a frictionless, maintenance-free alternative to the ball joint and with it dramatically changed the offshore petroleum industry.Oil States products were used for the first earthquake seismic bearing in the United States and for the creation of dock hinges for the Alyeska terminal.Oil States engineered, constructed and installed the world’s first steel catenary riser for a floating production system in Brazil.Oil States was the prime contractor for the world’s first titanium drilling riser.For more information about our Offshore Products business, please visit: http://oilstates.com/Operations Map » Site Map | Terms & Conditions© 2013 Oil States International, Inc.

BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production



Exploration and Production






BP’s oil and gas exploration and production division is one of its core businesses, globally and in the United States. Teams in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and onshore areas of the lower 48 states are responsible for finding and safely extracting the energy resources America needs.
Gulf of Mexico
Nearly three decades after BP began exploring the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the company remains one of the region’s leading oil and gas producers, with lease blocks covering an area more than twice the size of Delaware. In fact, BP has been the largest energy investor in the deepwater Gulf over the past decade.
Between 2013 and 2015, its average daily production in the region increased from 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 249,000. This reflects BP’s continued investment at its four massive Gulf of Mexico production platforms: Atlantis, Na Kika, Thunder Horse and Mad Dog. Elsewhere in the gulf, the company holds interests in four hubs that other companies operate: Mars, Olympus, Ursa and Great White.
Alaska
BP has spent more than half a century exploring and developing Alaska’s oil and gas resources, and its operations in and around the giant Prudhoe Bay field, located on the North Slope, account for around 55 percent of the state’s oil and gas production.
Since Prudhoe Bay began production in 1977, it has generated more than 12 billion barrels of oil — far exceeding initial projections — thanks in part to enhanced oil recovery technologies that BP pioneered. Four decades after starting up, Prudhoe Bay remains one of North America’s largest oil fields.
Lower 48
In the lower 48 states, BP’s onshore business now is independently operated but still wholly owned. BP chose to separate its lower 48 operations so they could be more flexible and agile, and thus more competitive, in a rapidly changing environment.
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey. In 2015, BP’s average daily oil and gas production in the Lower 48 was about 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent.













Alaska
Alaska remains one of BP’s leading resource basins. After more than 36 years of production, the North Slope still has a large amount of the discovered oil and gas remaining.














Gulf of Mexico
BP and its heritage companies have been at work in the Gulf of Mexico since the 1950s, and it has been exploring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (depths greater than 1,200 feet) for more than a quarter century.














U.S. Lower 48
The U.S. Lower 48 business has significant activities producing natural gas, NGLs and condensate across seven states, including production from unconventional gas, coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas assets.

Sophisticated Support, Around the Clock
At BP, safety is a 24/7 job for everyone. See the innovative ways we have each other’s back. 












Perfecting Skills Before We Use Them
At BP, everyone depends on each another –  we train together as a team to be better prepared for any scenario.

An oil drilling platform off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA - 6 December 2011


Offshore drilling is a mechanical process where a wellbore is drilled below the seabed. It is typically carried out in order to explore for and subsequently extract petroleum which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed. Most commonly, the term is used to describe drilling activities on the continental shelf, though the term can also be applied to drilling in lakes, inshore waters and inland seas.
Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate.
There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning.

History[edit]
Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the Grand Lake St. Marys (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in Ohio. The wells were developed by small local companies such as Bryson, Riley Oil, German-American and Banker's Oil.
Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the Summerland field extending under the Santa Barbara Channel in California. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.[1][2]
Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of Lake Erie in the 1900s and Caddo Lake in Louisiana in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the Texas and Louisiana gulf coast. The Goose Creek Oil Field near Baytown, Texas is one such example. In the 1920s drilling activities occurred from concrete platforms in Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo.
One of the oldest subsea wells is the Bibi Eibat well, which came on stream in 1923 in Azerbaijan.[3][dubious – discuss] The well was located on an artificial island in a shallow portion of the Caspian Sea. In the early 1930s, the Texas Co., later Texaco (now Chevron) developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
In 1937, Pure Oil (now Chevron) and its partner Superior Oil (now ExxonMobil) used a fixed platform to develop a field 1 mile (1.6 km) offshore of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana in 14 feet (4.3 m) of water.
In 1938, Humble Oil built a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.[4]
In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President Harry Truman to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit "freedom of the seas" regime.
In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now ExxonMobil) drilled at a site 18 miles (29 km) off the coast, erecting a platform in 18 feet (5.5 m) of water off St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.
In early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling and production platform in 20 feet (6.1 m) of water some 18 miles (29 km) off Vermilion Parish, La. But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now Anadarko Petroleum), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum (ConocoPhillips) and Stanolind Oil & Gas (BP) that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.[5]
When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to 30 metres (98 ft), fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the 100 feet (30 m) to 120 metres (390 ft) depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first jack-up rigs began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.
The first semi-submersible resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for Shell Oil Company. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by Edward Robert Armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the 'seadrome'. The first purpose-built drilling semi-submersible Ocean Driller was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.
The first offshore drillship was the CUSS 1 developed for the Mohole project to drill into the Earth's crust.
As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.[6]
One of the world's deepest hubs is currently the Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by Royal Dutch Shell and was built at a cost of $3 billion.[7] The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.
Main offshore fields[edit]
Notable offshore fields include:

the North Sea
the Gulf of Mexico (offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama)
California (in the Los Angeles Basin and Santa Barbara Channel, part of the Ventura Basin)
the Caspian Sea (notably some major fields offshore Azerbaijan)
the Campos and Santos Basins off the coasts of Brazil
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (Atlantic Canada)
several fields off West Africa most notably west of Nigeria and Angola
offshore fields in South East Asia and Sakhalin, Russia
major offshore oil fields are located in the Persian Gulf such as Safaniya, Manifa and Marjan which belong to Saudi Arabia and are developed by Saudi Aramco.[8]
fields in India (Mumbai High, K G Basin-East Coast Of India, Tapti Field, Gujarat, India)
the Taranaki Basin in New Zealand

Challenges[edit]
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the Troll A platform standing on a depth of 300 meters.
Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.
The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.
The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea, by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the Barents Sea. One such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).
Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the petroleum industry, at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.
Effects on the environment[edit]
See also: ecological effects of oil platforms
Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.[9] Produced water is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.

These include bottom founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning.

History[edit]
Around 1891, the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the Grand Lake St. Marys (a.k.a. Mercer County Reservoir) in Ohio. The wells were developed by small local companies such as Bryson, Riley Oil, German-American and Banker's Oil.
Around 1896, the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the Summerland field extending under the Santa Barbara Channel in California. The wells were drilled from piers extending from land out into the channel.[1][2]
Other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the Canadian side of Lake Erie in the 1900s and Caddo Lake in Louisiana in the 1910s. Shortly thereafter wells were drilled in tidal zones along the Texas and Louisiana gulf coast. The Goose Creek Oil Field near Baytown, Texas is one such example. In the 1920s drilling activities occurred from concrete platforms in Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo.
One of the oldest subsea wells is the Bibi Eibat well, which came on stream in 1923 in Azerbaijan.[3][dubious – discuss] The well was located on an artificial island in a shallow portion of the Caspian Sea. In the early 1930s, the Texas Co., later Texaco (now Chevron) developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
In 1937, Pure Oil (now Chevron) and its partner Superior Oil (now ExxonMobil) used a fixed platform to develop a field 1 mile (1.6 km) offshore of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana in 14 feet (4.3 m) of water.
In 1938, Humble Oil built a mile-long wooden trestle with railway tracks into the sea at McFadden Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, placing a derrick at its end - this was later destroyed by a hurricane.[4]
In 1945, concern for American control of its offshore oil reserves caused President Harry Truman to issue an Executive Order unilaterally extending American territory to the edge of its continental shelf, an act that effectively ended the 3-mile limit "freedom of the seas" regime.
In 1946, Magnolia Petroleum (now ExxonMobil) drilled at a site 18 miles (29 km) off the coast, erecting a platform in 18 feet (5.5 m) of water off St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.
In early 1947, Superior Oil erected a drilling and production platform in 20 feet (6.1 m) of water some 18 miles (29 km) off Vermilion Parish, La. But it was Kerr-McGee Oil Industries (now Anadarko Petroleum), as operator for partners Phillips Petroleum (ConocoPhillips) and Stanolind Oil & Gas (BP) that completed its historic Ship Shoal Block 32 well in October 1947, months before Superior actually drilled a discovery from their Vermilion platform farther offshore. In any case, that made Kerr-McGee's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land.[5]
When offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to 30 metres (98 ft), fixed platform rigs were built, until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the 100 feet (30 m) to 120 metres (390 ft) depth of the Gulf of Mexico, the first jack-up rigs began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ENSCO International.
The first semi-submersible resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four-column submersible Blue Water Rig No.1 in the Gulf of Mexico for Shell Oil Company. As the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in the floating mode. The concept of an anchored, stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by Edward Robert Armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the 'seadrome'. The first purpose-built drilling semi-submersible Ocean Driller was launched in 1963. Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.
The first offshore drillship was the CUSS 1 developed for the Mohole project to drill into the Earth's crust.
As of June, 2010, there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs (Jackups, semisubs, drillships, barges) available for service in the competitive rig fleet.[6]
One of the world's deepest hubs is currently the Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, floating in 2,438 meters of water. It is operated by Royal Dutch Shell and was built at a cost of $3 billion.[7] The deepest operational platform is the Petrobras America Cascade FPSO in the Walker Ridge 249 field in 2,600 meters of water.
Main offshore fields[edit]
Notable offshore fields include:

the North Sea
the Gulf of Mexico (offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama)
California (in the Los Angeles Basin and Santa Barbara Channel, part of the Ventura Basin)
the Caspian Sea (notably some major fields offshore Azerbaijan)
the Campos and Santos Basins off the coasts of Brazil
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (Atlantic Canada)
several fields off West Africa most notably west of Nigeria and Angola
offshore fields in South East Asia and Sakhalin, Russia
major offshore oil fields are located in the Persian Gulf such as Safaniya, Manifa and Marjan which belong to Saudi Arabia and are developed by Saudi Aramco.[8]
fields in India (Mumbai High, K G Basin-East Coast Of India, Tapti Field, Gujarat, India)
the Taranaki Basin in New Zealand

Challenges[edit]
Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. Production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment, such as the Troll A platform standing on a depth of 300 meters.
Another type of offshore platform may float with a mooring system to maintain it on location. While a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform, the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities.
The ocean can add several thousand meters or more to the fluid column. The addition increases the equivalent circulating density and downhole pressures in drilling wells, as well as the energy needed to lift produced fluids for separation on the platform.
The trend today is to conduct more of the production operations subsea, by separating water from oil and re-injecting it rather than pumping it up to a platform, or by flowing to onshore, with no installations visible above the sea. Subsea installations help to exploit resources at progressively deeper waters—locations which had been inaccessible—and overcome challenges posed by sea ice such as in the Barents Sea. One such challenge in shallower environments is seabed gouging by drifting ice features (means of protecting offshore installations against ice action includes burial in the seabed).
Offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges. An offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria, sleeping quarters, management and other support functions. In the North Sea, staff members are transported by helicopter for a two-week shift. They usually receive higher salary than onshore workers do. Supplies and waste are transported by ship, and the supply deliveries need to be carefully planned because storage space on the platform is limited. Today, much effort goes into relocating as many of the personnel as possible onshore, where management and technical experts are in touch with the platform by video conferencing. An onshore job is also more attractive for the aging workforce in the petroleum industry, at least in the western world. These efforts among others are contained in the established term integrated operations. The increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore. Subsea facilities are also easier to expand, with new separators or different modules for different oil types, and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation.
Effects on the environment[edit]
See also: ecological effects of oil platforms
Offshore oil production involves environmental risks, most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities, and from leaks and accidents on the platform.[9] Produced water is also generated, which is water brought to the surface along with the oil and gas; it is usually highly saline and may include dissolved or unseparated hydrocarbons.

An oil drilling platform off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA - 6 December 2011


Offshore drilling is a mechanical process where a wellbore is drilled below the seabed. It is typically carried out in order to explore for and subsequently extract petroleum which lies in rock formations beneath the seabed. Most commonly, the term is used to describe drilling activities on the continental shelf, though the term can also be applied to drilling in lakes, inshore waters and inland seas.
Offshore drilling presents environmental challenges, both from the produced hydrocarbons and the materials used during the drilling operation. Controversies include the ongoing US offshore drilling debate.
There are many different types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required drilling location using dynamic positioning.
