Canada's Investment Company
CI Investments has been managing money on behalf of Canadian investors 
      since 1965. In 1981, CI entered the global fund arena with the introduction 
      of CI Pacific Fund – one of the first funds in Canada devoted to Asian 
      markets. The company became known for its expertise in foreign funds and 
      adopted the name Canadian International Fund Management.
Over the years, CI expanded its lineup of funds to provide investors 
        with an increasingly comprehensive offering of Canadian, global and industry 
        funds. This growth was guided by a strategy of seeking the best available 
        portfolio managers.
CI is a leader in innovation. The company was, for example, the first 
        to offer tax-efficient funds with the introduction of CI Corporate Class. 
        CI also was a leader in introducing industry funds and was the first mutual 
        fund company to partner with an insurance company to offer segregated 
        funds. In 2013, CI launched the G5|20 Series, which offers guaranteed cash flow over 20 years and is the first mutual fund of its kind in Canada.
In June 2005, CI adopted the name CI Investments to reflect its diverse 
        lineup of investment options, including mutual funds, segregated funds, 
        asset allocation programs, structured products and other alternative investments.
Today, CI Investments is one of Canada’s largest investment fund companies. About two million Canadians trust us to help realize their financial goals.
CI is proud to partner with financial advisors across Canada, who offer 
        our funds to their clients. We believe investors are most successful when 
        they follow a sound financial plan developed with the assistance of a 
        qualified advisor.
CI is affiliated with two alternative asset management firms, Marret Asset Management Inc. (www.marret.com) and Lawrence Park Asset Management (lawrenceparkam.com).
CI also serves the institutional investment marketplace through a dedicated division, CI Institutional Asset Management, which is on the Web at www.ciinstitutional.com.
CI is a subsidiary of CI Financial Corp., which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol CIX.  Information about CI Financial’s assets and financial position is updated monthly and is available by visiting the Statistics section.

        all disciplines: value, blend (growth at a reasonable price) and growth. 
        These managers have been selected for their strategic focus, consistent

       Detailed Oversight of the Funds
CI has dedicated specialists and a wide-ranging set of policies and procedures 
        in place to ensure the good governance of its funds and to provide oversight 
        of their portfolio management activities. These include:

CI Investment Consulting, an experienced team of 
          investment experts who monitor the portfolio managers and the funds’ 
          portfolios to ensure they are adhering to their mandates and performing 
          within expectations. This group also assisted in the design of CI's 
          managed solutions - Portfolio Series and Portfolio Select Series - and 
          plays a key role in maintaining these programs.


The Compliance Department, whose duties include monitoring 
          trading activities by the funds' portfolio managers.


The CI Investments Board of Governors, an independent 
          governance body of all CI Funds, providing impartial judgment on conflicts 
          of interest with a view to the best interests of the CI Funds and CI 
          Investments investors. The Board of Governors recommends the best course 
          of action to achieve a fair and reasonable result on any conflict of 
          interest issues, and CI takes into account its recommendation in accordance 
          with its fiduciary duty to the CI Funds. All of the members of the Board 
          are independent of CI.

CI Investments Inc. Announces Launch of Signature Floating Rate Income Pool
Jul 17 17
CI Investments Inc. (‘CI’) is providing a new option for income investors concerned about rising interest rates with the launch of Signature Floating Rate Income Pool. The pool invests in a conservative, actively managed global portfolio of floating-rate bonds and leveraged loans, as well as shorter-term high-yield and investment-grade bonds, which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to other fixed-income securities. The pool provides an income stream through a monthly distribution. The launch of the fund is timely, as the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased its benchmark rate twice in 2017 with additional hikes expected. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada announced a rate increase of 0.25% on July 12, and raised the possibility of further increases this year. The lead portfolio managers are Mr. Marshall, CFA, who leads Signature's credit team, and Darren Arrowsmith, CFA, who has over 13 years of experience investing in floating rate instruments.

DECISION
Background
The principal regulator in the Jurisdiction has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdiction of the principal regulator (the Legislation) for a decision:

(a) pursuant to section 113 of the Securities Act (Ontario) (the OSA) exempting each Portfolio Pool and Non-Portfolio Pool (together, the Current Pooled Funds) and each Future Pooled Fund (as defined below and, together with the Current Pooled Funds, the Pooled Funds), from paragraph 111(2)(b), subsection 111(3) and subsection 111(4) of the OSA (the Related Party Relief); and
(b) pursuant to section 15.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations (NI 31-103) exempting the Filer from paragraph 13.5(2)(a) of NI 31-103 (the Consent Requirement Relief),

in each case with respect to investments by the Pooled Funds in securities of the Underlying Mutual Funds (as defined below) and for a decision revoking the Prior Relief (as defined below) (collectively, the Requested Relief).
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions:

(a) the Ontario Securities Commission is the principal regulator for the application; and
(b) the Filer has provided notice that Section 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon by the Filer in each of the other provinces of Canada (together with Ontario, the Applicable Jurisdictions).

Interpretation
Terms defined in MI 11-102 and National Instrument 14-101 Definitions have the same meaning if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined.
Representations
This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:

The Filer
1. The Filer is a corporation subsisting under the laws of the Province of Ontario with its head office located in Toronto, Ontario. The Filer is registered:

(a) under the securities legislation of each Applicable Jurisdiction as a portfolio manager;
(b) under the securities legislation of Ontario, Québec, and Newfoundland and Labrador as an investment fund manager;
(c) under the securities legislation of Ontario as an exempt market dealer; and
(d) under the Commodity Futures Act (Ontario) as a commodity trading counsel and a commodity trading manager.

First Asset Management Inc.
2. The parent company of the Manager, CI Financial Corp., acquired 100% indirect voting control of First Asset Investment Management Inc. (FAIMI) effective November 30, 2015.
3. FAIMI is a corporation subsisting under the laws of the Province of Ontario with its head office located in Toronto, Ontario. FAIMI is registered as an investment fund manager, a portfolio manager and an exempt market dealer under the Securities Act (Ontario).
4. FAIMI, or an affiliate of FAIMI, is or will be:

(a) the trustee and investment fund manager and may act as portfolio manager of one or more existing or future exchange traded mutual fund trusts; and
(b) the investment fund manager and may act as portfolio manager of one or more existing or future exchange traded mutual funds, each comprising a separate class of shares of First Asset Fund Corp., a mutual fund corporation subsisting under the laws of the Province of Ontario.
(individually an "Underlying ETF" and collectively, the "Underlying ETFs").

The Top Funds
5. Each Current Pooled Fund is, or will be, a trust formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario. Each Pooled Fund is, or will be:

(a) a "mutual fund" (as such term is defined in the OSA); and
(b) not a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of any province or territory of Canada.

6. The Filer is, or will be, the trustee and manager of each Current Pooled Fund.
7. The Filer may, in the future, become the trustee and manager of one or more trusts formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario each of which is:

(a) a "mutual fund" (as such term is defined in the OSA); and
(b) not a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of any province or territory of Canada,
(each a Future Pooled Fund).

8. Each Current Pooled Fund is not in default of securities legislation in any Applicable Jurisdiction.
9. Each LifeCycle Portfolio is sold exclusively to accredited investors (as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (NI 45-106)) other than individuals (Institutional Investors). Each Institutional Investor uses the units it owns of the LifeCycle Portfolios as the reference assets for investment products and services it offers to its clients. Each LifeCycle Portfolio provides a risk/return profile suitable for a specific investment horizon. To accomplish this goal, the LifeCycle Portfolio obtains exposure to a combination of fixed income and equity investments. Over time, the LifeCycle Portfolio adjusts its risk/return profile by increasing its exposure to fixed income investments (and decreases its exposure to equity investments) as the LifeCycle Portfolio approaches a pre-determined future date. This simplifies the investment process for Institutional Investors because they only need to own units of a single LifeCycle Portfolio as the reference asset for their corresponding investment product or service with an equivalent investment horizon, rather than investing directly in multiple mutual funds and periodically rebalancing such holdings to achieve the same profile.
10. Each CI Portfolio is sold exclusively to Institutional Investors. Each Institutional Investor uses the units it owns of the CI Portfolios as the reference assets for investment products and services it offers to its clients. Each CI Portfolio provides a pre-determined risk/return profile. To accomplish this goal, the CI Portfolio obtains exposure to a combination of fixed income and equity investments consistent with its risk/return profile. This simplifies the investment process for Institutional Investors because they only need to own units of a single CI Portfolio as the reference asset for their corresponding investment product or service with an equivalent risk/return profile, rather than investing directly in multiple mutual funds to achieve the same profile.
11. Units of each Non Portfolio Pool may be purchased by any investor who qualifies to purchase such units on a prospectus-exempt basis. Each Non-Portfolio Pool has its own investment objective and strategies. To achieve its investment objective, each Non-Portfolio Pool invests its assets in a combination of fixed income and equity securities, as well as securities of Underlying Mutual Funds.
The Underlying Funds
12. To achieve its investment objective, each Pooled Fund invests, or will invest some or all of its assets in securities of existing or future mutual funds managed by the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager, including (subject to obtaining the Requested Relief) the Underlying ETFs (collectively, the "Underlying Mutual Funds").
13. Each Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be, either:

(a) a trust formed under the laws of the Province of Ontario; or
(b) one or more classes of shares of CI Corporate Class Limited, a corporation subsisting under the laws of the Province of Ontario, or one or more series of a class of shares of First Asset Fund Corp., a corporation subsisting under the laws of the Province of Ontario (in either case, an Underlying Corporate Mutual Fund). The name of an Underlying Corporate Mutual Fund typically includes the word "Class".

14. Each Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be:

(a) a "mutual fund" (as such term is defined in the OSA); and
(b) a reporting issuer under the securities legislation of each province and territory of Canada.

Accordingly, National Instrument 81-101 Mutual Fund Prospectus Disclosure (NI 81-101) (in the case of Underlying Mutual Funds that are not Underlying ETFs), National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds (NI 81-102), National Instrument 41-101 Prospectus Contents -- Non-Financial Matters (NI 41-101) (in the case of Underlying Mutual Funds that are Underlying ETFs), and National Instrument 81-107 Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds apply to each Underlying Mutual Fund.
15. The Filer, FAIMI or another affiliate of the Filer is, or will be, the manager of each Underlying Mutual Fund.
16. Each existing Underlying Mutual Fund is not in default of securities legislation in any province or territory of Canada.
The Fund-on-Fund Structure
17. Each investment by a Pooled Fund in securities of an Underlying Mutual Fund ("Fund-on-Fund Investing") is, or will be, compatible with the investment objective and investment strategies of the Pooled Fund and, in the case of a Portfolio Pool, is, or will be, aligned with the risk/return profile of the Portfolio Pool.
18. On September 22, 2015, the Filer obtained related party relief and consent requirement relief (the Prior Relief). The Prior Relief only permits investments in Underlying Mutual Funds that are managed by the Filer, and as such, does not permit investments in Underlying Mutual Funds managed by FAIMI or an affiliate.
19. Each Underlying Mutual Fund typically holds, or will hold, investments in numerous different issuers, in some cases comprising more than 100 positions. Different Underlying Mutual Funds may use different portfolio advisers, each of which has its own investment approach. Fund-on-Fund Investing thereby provides each Pooled Fund with immediate diversification through exposure to the investment portfolios of all the Underlying Mutual Funds in which the Pooled Fund invests its assets. Each Portfolio Pool typically invests, or will invest, in 11 to 18 Underlying Mutual Funds which also provides the Portfolio Pool with diversification regarding portfolio advisers of the Underlying Mutual Funds.
20. When a Pooled Fund engages in Fund-on-Fund Investing:

(a) there is, or will be, no duplication of management fees or incentive fees in respect of the investment by the Pooled Fund in the Underlying Mutual Funds;
(b) there are, or will be, no sales fees or redemption fees payable by the Pooled Fund in respect of the acquisition, disposition or redemption of securities of the Underlying Mutual Funds; and
(c) if the Underlying Mutual Fund is an Underlying ETF, the Pooled Fund may pay brokerage commissions when it purchases or sells the Underlying ETF on an exchange.

21. Each current investor in a Pooled Fund has received disclosure in writing of:

(a) the intention of the Pooled Fund to invest in securities of Underlying Mutual Funds; and
(b) the relationships and potential conflicts of interest between the Pooled Fund and the Underlying Mutual Funds, including that the Underlying Mutual Funds are managed by the Filer,

the Previous Fund-on-Fund Disclosure.
22. Each future investor in a Pooled Fund will receive, prior to their first purchase of securities of a Pooled Fund, an offering memorandum or other written document containing the New Fund-on-Fund Information (as defined below).
23. Each Pooled Fund and Underlying Mutual Fund prepares annual audited financial statements and interim unaudited financial statements in accordance with National Instrument 81-106 Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure (NI 81-106) and complies with the other requirements of NI 81-106 applicable to it.
24. Unitholders of each Pooled Fund receive, on request, a copy of such Pooled Fund's audited annual financial statements and interim unaudited financial statements. The financial statements of each Pooled Fund disclose its holdings of securities of Underlying Mutual Funds.
25. The Filer will not cause the securities of an Underlying Mutual Fund held by a Pooled Fund to be voted at any meeting of the securityholders of the Underlying Mutual Fund; provided that the Filer may arrange for the securities of the Underlying Mutual Fund held by a Pooled Fund to be voted by the unitholders of the Pooled Fund.
26. The custodian of the assets of each Pooled Fund and each Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be, a financial institution that meets the qualifications for an investment fund custodian set out in subsection 6.2 of NI 81-102 or, for assets held outside of Canada, subsection 6.3 of NI 81-102.
27. Each Pooled Fund and its Underlying Mutual Funds have, or will have, matching valuation dates. Accordingly, each Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be, valued no less frequently than the Pooled Funds which invest in the Underlying Mutual Fund.
28. Each Underlying Mutual Fund's securities are, or will be, redeemable no less frequently than the units of the Pooled Funds which invest in the Underlying Mutual Fund (subject, in the case of any Underlying Mutual Fund that is an Underlying ETF, to the conditions relating to redemptions set out in its prospectus).
29. No Pooled Fund purchases or holds, or will purchase or hold, securities of an Underlying Mutual Fund unless, at the time of the purchase, the Underlying Mutual Fund holds no more than 10% of its net assets in securities of other investment funds unless:

(a) the other investment fund is a "money market fund" (as defined in NI 81-102);
(b) the securities of the other investment fund are "index participation units" (as defined in NI 81-102); or
(c) the Underlying Mutual Fund is a "clone fund" (as defined in NI 81-102).

30. Each Pooled Fund currently invests some or all of its assets in securities of Underlying Mutual Funds (other than Underlying ETFs). Such current investments comply with the requirements of securities legislation applicable to the Pooled Funds and the Filer except to the extent of any previously granted relief.
31. The aggregate amount invested from time to time in an Underlying Mutual Fund by a Pooled Fund and other related investment funds exceeds 20% of the outstanding voting securities of the Underlying Mutual Fund. As a result, each Pooled Fund, either alone or together with other related investment funds, is a substantial security holder of an Underlying Mutual Fund. Absent the Related Party Relief:

(a) paragraph 111(2)(b) of the OSA prohibits each Pooled Fund from using Fund-on-Fund Investing where it is a substantial security holder of the Underlying Mutual Fund; and
(b) subsections 111(3) and 111(4) of the OSA requires each Pooled Fund to dispose of such investments.

32. Certain directors and/or officers of CI Corporate Class Limited or First Asset Fund Corp. are or may, from time to time, be responsible persons (as such term is defined in NI 31-103) of a Pooled Fund. Absent the Consent Requirement Relief, paragraph 13.5(2)(a) of NI 31-103 prohibits the Filer from causing a Pooled Fund to invest in securities of an Underlying Corporate Mutual Fund in such circumstances.
33. By using Fund-on-Fund Investing, each Pooled Fund can obtain immediate, diversified exposure to the investment portfolios of all the Underlying Mutual Funds in which the Pooled Fund invests a portion of its assets. A single investment using Fund-on-Fund Investing provides a Pooled Fund with exposure to the numerous investments held by an Underlying Mutual Fund. In the case of a Portfolio Pool, Fund-on-Fund Investing provides the Portfolio Pool with exposure as many as 300 investments and potentially over 1,000 investments held by its Underlying Mutual Funds. The resulting diversification of investment exposure could not be replicated by a Pooled Fund investing directly in securities rather than using Fund-on-Fund Investing. Further, the Pooled Funds may use Fund-on-Fund Investing to obtain diversification regarding portfolio advisers of the Underlying Mutual Funds, which diversification could not be replicated by the Pooled Fund investing directly in securities rather than using Fund-on-Fund Investing.
34. Fund-on-Fund Investing by the Pooled Funds complies with all the requirements of section 2.5 of NI 81-102 and therefore addresses all the potential issues associated with these investments. The Requested Relief is required only because the Pooled Funds are not currently subject to the requirements of NI 81-102 and therefore cannot rely upon the exemptions contained in subsection 2.5(7) of NI 81-102.

Decision
The principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision.
The decision of the principal regulator under the Legislation is that the Requested Relief sought is granted provided that:

(a) the Prior Relief is hereby revoked and replaced with the present decision;
(b) securities of the Pooled Funds are distributed in Canada solely pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements in NI 45-106;
(c) each Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be, a "mutual fund" (as such term is defined in the OSA) to which the NI 81-102 and one of NI 81-101 or NI 41-101 applies;
(d) the investment by a Pooled Fund in an Underlying Mutual Fund is, or will be, compatible with the fundamental investment objectives of the Pooled Fund;
(e) no Pooled Fund purchases or holds, or will purchase or hold, securities of an Underlying Mutual Fund unless, at the time of the purchase of securities of the Underlying Mutual Fund, the Underlying Mutual Fund holds no more than 10% of its net assets in securities of other investment funds unless:

(i) the other investment fund is a "money market fund" (as defined in NI 81-102);
(ii) the securities of the other investment fund are "index participation units" (as defined in NI 81-102) issued by an investment fund; or
(iii) the Underlying Mutual Fund is a "clone fund" (as defined in NI 81-102).

(f) no management fees or incentive fees are payable by a Pooled Fund that, to a reasonable person, would duplicate a fee payable by an Underlying Mutual Fund for the same service;
(g) no sales fees or redemption fees are payable by a Pooled Fund in relation to its purchases or redemptions of securities of an Underlying Mutual Fund other than brokerage fees incurred for the purchase and sale of Underlying Mutual Funds that are exchange traded funds;
(h) the Filer, or its affiliate, does not cause the securities of the Underlying Mutual Fund held by a Pooled Fund to be voted at any meeting of holders of such securities, except that the Filer, or its affiliate, may arrange for the securities the Pooled Fund holds of the Underlying Mutual Fund to be voted by the beneficial holders of securities of the Pooled Fund; and
(i) prior to making their first investment in a Pooled Fund, each investor will be provided with an offering memorandum or, if no offering memorandum is prepared, another written document that discloses the following (the New Fund-on-Fund Information):

(i) that the Pool Fund may purchase securities of the Underlying Mutual Funds;
(ii) the fact that the Filer or an affiliate of the Filer is the investment fund manager of both the Pooled Fund and the Underlying Mutual Funds;
(iii) the approximate or maximum percentage of net assets of the Pooled Fund that the Pooled Fund intends to invest in securities of the Underlying Mutual Funds;
(iv) the process or criteria used to select the Underlying Mutual Funds;
(v) where the Pooled Fund indirectly bears any fees (including performance-based fees) or expenses incurred by an Underlying Mutual Fund, a description of such fees and expenses; and
(vi) that they are entitled to receive from the Filer, or its affiliates, on request and free of charge, a copy of:

(A) the Fund Facts, ETF Summary Document or ETF Facts, if available;
(B) the annual or semi-annual financial statements;
(C) the management report of fund performance (MRFP); and
(D) any other continuous disclosure documents that the Underlying Mutual Funds may make available to its investors;

relating to all Underlying Mutual Funds in which the Pooled Fund may invest its assets.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Suncoast Credit Union


                                            Once again Suncoast has shown itself to be a preschooler in the land of credit unions. They don't understand beneficiary designations for CDs, they make getting a credit card - one of the money makers for them - nearly impossible, and now they don't want newcomers to...show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.

Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care. Visit http://www.merrilledge.com/retirement/rollover-ira or call a Merrill Edge rollover specialist at 888.637.3343 for additional information about your choices.
