A Closed-End Fund Designed for Investors Seeking Income and Preservation of Capital primarily through investments in Dividend Paying Equities and Fixed Income.
Eagle Growth and Income Opportunities Fund is designed to offer investors:





Tactically managed portfolio consisting of dividend-paying stocks and fixed income securities
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions**
12 year term
Tax advantaged options overlay strategy to seek to generate current income
Exposure to the investment expertise of Eagle Asset
Management’s portfolio managers who have focused on growth and income opportunities since 1976


 




Raymond James and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated member New York Stock Exchange/SIPC, is acting as the lead underwriters in connection with the proposed offering.
There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objective will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investors could lose some or all of their investment. For a summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, please see the “Risk Factors” section of the final prospectus.
The Fund intends to use leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment. The use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility and greater declines of the Fund’s net asset value, and fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the Fund. For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the final prospectus.
The securities in which the Fund will invest may be rated below investment grade. Such securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to an issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal and are commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk” bonds

Eagle Growth & Income Fund




Affiliated Managed Account

Eagle Equity Income Strategy






The Eagle Growth & Income Fund offers clients the opportunity to seek steady income and also the opportunity to participate in the market's long-term growth potential. The fund is diversified among common stocks, convertible bonds, convertible preferred stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs).







Investment Process

InvestmentTeam

Key Facts

Holdings

Performance

Literature





The Eagle Growth & Income team identifies investment opportunities based on the following criteria:
Income

Yield or dividend growth at or above the S&P 500 Index
Demonstrated commitment to paying and increasing dividends

Growth

Dominance in expanding industry
Growth rate greater than inflation

Stability

Free cash flow and shareholder-oriented management
Stock price below estimated intrinsic value

Sell discipline

Price appreciation near or above sustainable level
Deterioration of company fundamentals, indicative of dividend cut
Occupation of too large a portion of total portfolio
Development of more attractive investment opportunity

A Word about Risk

International investing presents specific risks, such as currency fluctuations, differences in financial accounting standards as well as potential political and economic instability. Because the fund normally will hold a focused portfolio of stocks of fewer companies than many other diversified funds, the increase or decrease of the value of a single stock may have a greater impact on the funds net asset value and total return. As with all equity investing, there is the risk that an unexpected change in the market or within the company itself may have an adverse effect on its stock. The biggest risk of equity investing is that returns can fluctuate and investors can lose money.

Eagle Growth and Income Opportunities Fund Declares Monthly 
      Distribution of $0.083 Per Share






April 03, 2017 05:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eagle Growth and Income Opportunities Fund (the “Fund”) (NYSE:EGIF) 
      today announced the declaration of its monthly distribution of $0.083 
      per common share, payable April 28, 2017. Based on the Fund’s current 
      share price of $16.96 as of its close on April 3, 2017, the 
      distribution represents an annualized yield of 5.87%. Information 
      regarding the distribution rate is included for informational purposes 
      only and is not necessarily indicative of future results, the 
      achievement of which cannot be assured. The distribution rate should not 
      be considered the yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.
    

      The following dates apply to this distribution:
    





           
        

           
        

           
        

           
        





          Ex-Dividend Date:
        









          April 12, 2017
        



          Record Date:
        









          April 17, 2017
        



          Payable Date:
        









          April 28, 2017
        













           
        



      A portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other 
      than undistributed net investment income, including but not limited to 
      short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain or return of capital. As 
      required by Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a 
      notice will be distributed to the Fund’s stockholders in the event that 
      a portion of a monthly distribution is derived from sources other than 
      undistributed net investment income. In January or February of each 
      year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV for the previous calendar 
      year that will define how to report these distributions for federal 
      income tax purposes.
    

      The investment return, price, yields, market value and net asset value 
      (NAV) of the Fund’s shares will fluctuate with market conditions, and it 
      is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. Closed-end funds 
      frequently trade at a discount to NAV, which may increase the investor’s 
      risk of loss. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its 
      investment objective.
    

      Investment return and principal value will fluctuate. Past performance 
      is not a guarantee of future results.
