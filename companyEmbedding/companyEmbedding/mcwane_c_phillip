Phillip McWane and Ruffner Page visit MSPL Team in Coimbatore, India

Dec 2


Posted by mcwaneinc



On a recent trip to India, McWane Chairman Phillip McWane and Chief Executive Officer Ruffner Page had the opportunity to see firsthand the McWane Services Private Ltd. (MSPL) operations that support McWane companies worldwide. They were impressed by the quality and support provided by each of the teams and the collaborative effort between MSPL and the McWane divisions in the U.S. They toured the Design, Product Development, IT/Help Desk, and Sales Support Services operations and discussed the various services with MSPL team members. There is potential for future expansion of these services to other McWane divisions that are not currently using these services. 
The tech team currently supports Synapse, Zinwave, and Nighthawk and the goal is to expand these services to the Indian market. This is an example of how McWane teams 10,000 miles apart can work together to pool their strengths and develop products for both the U.S. and Indian markets. The tech team demonstrated the use of the iron mesh and the Multihawk for Phillip and Ruffner as well as the proposed plans for introducing these products to the Indian market. Phillip and Ruffner were pleased to learn that MSPL plans to open a remote office in Bangalore, India. Additional labs that will work on remote metering solutions, condition monitoring, and water solutions are also planned for the future. 
Phillip and Ruffner also toured the valve plant and the valve testing and tooling facilities. The valve plant was set up in a record 6 months and is already supplying valves not only to South America and McWane Gulf, but has also entered the Indian market as well. The valves have been well received in the Indian market and we should see an uptick in sales in India in 2016 of the resilient gate, air release, check, and butterfly valves. In 2016, MSPL plans to expand the sizes offered and introduce and sell the metal seated and knife valves as well. 
The two-day visit to Coimbatore ended with a dinner hosted by the MSPL team in honor of the visiting senior executives from the U.S.

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]




Vulcan statue at the center of Vulcan Park, Birmingham, Alabama.


The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]

The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]

The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]

The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]

The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

McWane, Inc. | Nighthawk











































McWane, Inc.

The McWane family of companies has been a part of American industry     since 1921. We have a strong history, and we're building our future     across America and the world. 
PhilosophyWE HONOR our heritage by manufacturing products that are lasting and sustainable.WE INVEST in the future of our business, our employees, and our communities.WE COMMIT to excellence in integrity, service, and quality.WE LEAD with the highest standards of workplace safety and environmental stewardship.These enduring principles are the foundation of our continued success.Company HistoryThe   history of McWane traces its roots to the ingenuity of a family who   lived in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Charles Phillip (C.P.)   McWane entered the foundry business in 1871. His sons, Henry and James   Ransom (J.R.), managed various parts of the family business. J. R.   McWane settled in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1903 and began a modest foundry   enterprise, which shifted to a coke and coal business when the foundry   business faltered. Henry McWane then set up a subsidiary, McWane Pipe   Works, to make cast iron pipe and fittings. It was a promising line of   business, and J. R. McWane later joined the American Cast Iron Pipe   Company, eventually rising to president and establishing innovations in   the industry along with worker welfare initiatives. He not only grew  the  business, he gained notoriety as a leader in employee relations.As   America grew, so did the need to supply flourishing cities with clean   water and to remove waste safely. In 1921, McWane began a new venture,   the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company. As the business grew he expanded   operations from Birmingham to include a second facility in Provo, Utah,   the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. After Henry’s death in  1933,  his son William (Bill) McWane took over as president, guiding the  two  foundries through the good and bad times of the 1930s and World  War II.Beginning  in the 1960s, McWane focused on expansion by  acquiring Empire Coke  Company, a manufacturer of foundry coke and  by-products, Atlantic States  Cast Iron Pipe Company, Union Foundry  Company, a waterworks fittings  business, M&H Valve Company, Clow  Water Systems, Clow Valve, Kennedy  Valve Company, and created McWane  International to market their  products worldwide. McWane entered the  Canadian market by acquiring  Canada Pipe Company in Hamilton, Ontario,  and continued expanding in the United States by acquiring Tyler Pipe Company,  ANACO, a couplings operation, the  Bibby Companies, companies  specializing in grey and ductile cast iron,  Manchester Tank &  Equipment Company, and Brunner Manufacturing and  Amerex, two steel  fabrication companies.In 2008, Janus Fire  Systems joined McWane.  Then, in 2012, McWane began their  diversification strategy into  technology by adding Synapse Wireless to  their portfolio of companies."McWane's long successful history comes  from multi-generational  thinking," said G. Ruffner Page, President of  McWane. "We chose Synapse  as our entry point into advanced technology  because of our closely  shared vision for the future, our strong cultural  fit and the extremely  broad capabilities of the SNAP platform."Additional technology  additions to McWane include ComTech, a  mobile communications  service provider based in Seoul, Futurecom, an  Ontario-based RF  coverage extension solutions, and Nighthawk, a leading  provider for  wireless smart grid solutions.Today McWane, Inc. is  led by  Chairman Phillip McWane. As a family-run company with over 5,500   global employees, McWane strongly believes in preserving and   contributing to the communities in which its facilities operate. In   addition to saving thousands of American jobs and contributing millions   of tax dollars to the U.S. economy, McWane has invested significantly  in  meeting and improving its performance in safety and environmental   excellence. McWane takes pride in its past while looking forward to the   future, certain in the knowledge that an industry so important to our   nation’s history remains a vital part of America’s future.

The "McWane Way" Today - What Do the Workers Say?
McWane and China
McWane President Ruffner Page's January 2008 on-camera statement
Ruffner Page's November 2007 letter outlining what has changed at McWane (PDF)
Philip McWane's and Ruffner Page's statements at 2005 sentencing hearing

Five years ago, when a New York Times reporter asked a McWane lawyer for an interview with company executives, he was told, "Son, the McWanes haven't talked in a hundred years, and they aren't about to start now."
Today, however, it's a different story. While Phillip McWane himself still refuses to meet or talk with FRONTLINE, McWane's approach to media relations has changed dramatically.
When FRONTLINE contacted McWane in 2007 for an update to its original reporting, McWane President Ruffner Page responded almost immediately. In a letter (PDF file), Mr. Page wrote, "I welcome the opportunity to share information and talk about the dramatic transformation of our Company since the original publication and broadcast."
Gregory L. Vistica, media consultant for McWane
Over the course of the next three months, McWane sent additional letters, as well as binders with thousands of pages of supporting materials, as evidence of their turnaround. McWane also hired a "strategic media adviser," former investigative reporter Gregory Vistica, who now makes a living by advising corporations and wealthy individuals on press strategy. Nearly all of our phone conversations and email communications were then channeled through Mr. Vistica, and occasionally McWane General Counsel James Proctor, who has been with the company since 1995.
While McWane provided thorough written responses to most of FRONTLINE's questions, certain issues were off the table. For instance, the company would not comment on any of their criminal cases, citing ongoing litigation and appeals. Nor would McWane entertain the idea of FRONTLINE meeting with or interviewing Phillip McWane, the company's chairman. As for meeting or an interview with Ruffner Page, McWane's president, we were told that it was "a possibility." Mr. Page initially agreed to a private dinner in Birmingham, but everything he said was to be "off-the-record," although he later allowed FRONTLINE to put "on the record" some portions of this conversation.
In the end, Mr. Page granted FRONTLINE's request to go on camera, but he insisted that no questions be asked. Mr. Page agreed only to read a prepared statement and to be filmed walking through a McWane plant, their AB&I Foundry in Oakland, Calif.
At a McWane sentencing hearing in December 2005 (for convictions for charges that were subsequently reversed on appeal) Mr. Page told the court that 70 percent of the senior managers of the company and its plants had been replaced during his first year as president of McWane, 1999 to 2000.  He made similar claims in his on-camera statement. However, the public record and our own reporting indicates that many of the managers and vice presidents who were indicted were in managerial roles when Mr. Page took over and stayed in similar roles until the federal indictments were returned. We asked McWane for a clarification. At first they reported that nine managers were removed, retired or terminated. Then they increased that number to 20, but did not provide names or other details. 
While FRONTLINE was unsuccessful in speaking to Phillip McWane, we obtained a transcript of a statement he made at the same 2005 criminal sentencing hearing at which Mr. Page spoke. Read both Phillip McWane's and Ruffner Page's comments at this hearing here.
Overall, while McWane has argued that the original stories were "one-sided" and "inaccurate," they acknowledge that The Times and FRONTLINE "accelerated the process" of change at the company. The increased scrutiny of the company by worker safety and environmental authorities, Mr. Page says, forces them to live up to a higher standard which he says he welcomes as the company tries to become the industry leader.

The following are McWane President Ruffner Page's on-the-record responses to questions that were posed in off-camera discussions with FRONTLINE. The responses were provided by public relations consultant Gregory Vistica via email on Jan. 10, 2008. FRONTLINE's questions were edited for clarity. The company's responses have been arranged by topic but otherwise have not been edited.
QUESTION: What was the reaction of McWane President Ruffner Page -- and that of the corporation as a whole -- to the original FRONTLINE/New York Times stories published and broadcast in January 2003?
RESPONSE: Of course we were disappointed with the coverage, and are troubled by the inaccurate impression it created of our Company. While several of our plants had experienced problems, all resulting from different causes unique to each, by the time of the 2003 broadcast we were well down the road toward correcting them. Also, the broadcast greatly overstated them and also created the misleading impression that all of our operations were experiencing problems, when in fact* most of them were and are well run, well managed, safe and compliant.
… We did not have a lot of experience with the press, especially the national press. The McWane family has always been a very quiet, private family as has their company. Even their millions of dollars in philanthropy usually were given anonymously. During the summer of 2002 we began to hear about reporters interviewing people about our company, and that some of the people involved in the reporting appeared to be interested only in the negative. For example, in June of 2002 one person said that a reporter told him that the NYT/Frontline intended to make McWane into the "Enron of private industry". Another former personnel director told us that she told a reporter many positive things about the company but that the reporter was not interested and only wanted to get confirmation of negative rumors. That reporter also referred to the several other people who had said good things about the company as "flakes". Several months later we were contacted by Mr. Bergman and Mr. Barstow and asked to give an on camera interview, but when asked, they refused to tell us what questions would be asked.** As a result, we were suspicious about the reporters' motives and concluded that they did not intend to run a fair story and only wanted to ambush us on camera with surprise questions, not for the purpose of understanding the truth, but for the purpose of obtaining dramatic video footage. Nevertheless, we supplied documents detailing the positive things we had done, and responded to some of the allegations we had heard. We made the decision only to communicate in writing until the reporters would tell us what they wanted to talk about, which did not occur until a few weeks before the articles ran.
The articles and the documentary were a shock.
Editor's notes:
* In 2007, McWane's Clow Valve Foundry in Oskaloosa, Iowa was recognized as an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Merit site. McWane says they are the first iron and brass foundry operation in the country to gain that status. OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), according to its website, is "official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health programs." Similar status has been given to McWane's plant in Elkhart, Ind. McWane also points out that it believes that its once troubled foundries are now "industry leaders" and that once their criminal prosecutions are over they intend to apply for the VPP program.
** As a matter of policy, FRONTLINE and The New York Times do not provide specific questions to subjects prior to any interview. In this case however, ahead of a potential on-the-record interview, we submitted to McWane a detailed letter containing 154 specific issues that would be addressed in the broadcast and/or articles. 
QUESTION: Without the prosecutions and the multi-million dollar fines, a former prosecutor told us there would not have been the kind of turnaround that McWane says it has made. McWane consultants say it "accelerated the process." Did they?
RESPONSE: We started the process of correcting the problems at those facilities long before the prosecutors interviewed their first witness. The adverse publicity from the broadcast only created pressure to make changes more quickly.
QUESTION: There are those, including "whistleblowers," former employees who were injured or the families of the deceased that are still "skeptical" about McWane. Some underscored their skepticism by saying that the company continued to pay legal fees and salaries to vice presidents and plant managers after they were convicted. Why did McWane retain these employees and pay their legal fees?
RESPONSE: We believe in the American constitutional principle that you are innocent until proven guilty, and that every citizen is entitled to their day in court. As you can appreciate, legal representation is a very expensive process and beyond the means of most people. All of our employees maintained their innocence, and in fact several were found innocent and others won their appeals and had their convictions overturned. Consistent with our corporate bylaws, early on in this process, and with the government's full knowledge, we agreed to pay for the defense of our employees. The employees who were found innocent at trial and those whose convictions were recently overturned on appeal likely could not have defended themselves without the company's continued assistance.
As I am sure you know, Judge Kaplan from New York recently penalized the government severely for its policy of trying to force companies to stop paying the legal fees of its employees, concluding that the government's policy is a violation of the employees' constitutional rights. A copy of his opinion, that discusses the issue in some detail, is attached for your reference.
Editor's note: McWane refers to a 2006 opinion written by Southern District Court of New York Judge Lewis A. Kaplan regarding consulting firm KPMG's refusal to advance or pay legal fees for employees.
QUESTION: Our understanding is that McWane's OSHA and EPA problems began with the company expanding rapidly, spreading out across North America and that the company evolved into a structure that allowed its plants too much autonomy.
RESPONSE: McWane always had a decentralized management structure that was intended to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship at the individual plants. That model worked well with a small company. In the 1990's, however, the company grew very rapidly, from 11 facilities in 1994 to 30 in 2000, and from 2,900 employees to 7,000. This growth created many challenges in managing all aspects of operations, including compliance activities in some locations. In the late 1990's we recognized the need to revise our management systems, and began a program of capital spending, management changes, the development of new compliance systems, a program that was well underway by 2002.
QUESTION: What was going on at McWane in 2002-2003?
RESPONSE: We first started to become aware of the problems in the late 90's and early 00's. Many were inherited because of the rapid expansion and decentralization of the company so that McWane in Birmingham really did not have a handle on all the problems. As we became aware of the problems, we began making capital and other expenditures and management changes to try and change things. Many of these changes were well underway by the time the stories came out.
RESPONSE RE: Turnaround"We had initiated changes and were continuing in that direction long before 2003. As a result of your articles the process accelerated."
QUESTION: The Associated Press ran a story in 2004 that quoted Ruffner Page:"We are nearing the point where we can't sustain multiple indictments and be a successful company," McWane President Ruffner Page said. "No company can."
RESPONSEThis comment came in the context of the indictments in Birmingham [Ala.] and the Empire Coke soil sampling incident. 
RESPONSE RE: Personnel Changes
We brought in the best people we could find to introduce new procedures. I began going to McWane Cast Iron after a meeting with John Henshaw. Every morning I would go and see for myself what was going on. Today, I along with others get email reports every time there is an injury or illness that leads to lost work days. 
I began to change the management teams at the plants as early as 2000. Almost 90 % of our senior and EHS management are either new or have been reassigned. Anyone who was unable to deal with the fact that we were going to change the way things were done especially from a health and safety and environment perspective was terminated or reassigned. We have added more than 200 people for EHS including the best people we could find to run it.
RESPONSE RE: On OSHA Citations since 2003
Our record keeping and monitoring of health and safety as well as environmental practices strive to be the best in the business. I think they are there now. But we know that this is an ongoing process. We are dedicated to improving our relationship with OSHA. Because of all of the negative publicity we know that we are held to a higher standard when we are inspected, which results in more citations and higher penalties than others might receive for the same issues. However, we welcome that heightened scrutiny. We hold ourselves to higher standards than what is acceptable in the industry, and want to be the best. When the regulators reinforce that effort by being harder on us they only help us get better. If you think OSHA is tough, you ought to meet Barb Wisniewski, our Health and Safety VP. She is as tough as they get and she has our full support.
RESPONSE RE: McWane's Labor Force and role in the economy
Our company makes products that are vital to our country's infrastructure. We make the pipe that brings water into our homes and takes the sewage out. We make the fire hydrants for those same homes. In the process we provide well-paying, safe jobs for more than 7,000 people, including thousands of blue collar workers who can earn a comfortable middle class living even without a college education.
RESPONSE RE: McWane in China
The factory in China began as an idea because of market pressures. Competitors were importing from China and India. Labor costs are low so importing fittings in particular makes economic sense and allows us to preserve our US operations as well.
We traveled first to India and saw the conditions there. It was not acceptable. We went to China where at least the conditions are not as primitive and decided to build our own plant which operates there today guided by employee health and safety protection and environmental controls similar to those in the United States. In 2006 we were awarded the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" from the Cangzhou city Environmental Protection Bureau.
The product that we make in China is the ductile iron waterworks fitting, which has a high labor content. We initially sought protection under 421, which is available through the government for protection from China dumping actions. And even though the ITC ruled unanimously in our favor, the President declined to sign the petition. As a result, we were at such an economic disadvantage due to the low labor costs associated with China's workforce that we were either going to have to build a plant a China, outsource our operation or leave the business.
And our choice was to go build our own facility where we could control the environmental health and safety practices at that facility. We did that through 2004 and 2005, developed a program we call China Plus in China, which exceeds the Chinese environmental health and safety regulations, enforce our employees there wearing protective equipment. And as result, we have a cost-competitive blend of products that we can offer our customers.
See FRONTLINE's short summary on McWane and China.
RESPONSE : Injured Employees
In response to any employee that's hurt or injured while conducting their work at our facilities, of course, we feel terrible about that. And we want our employees to go home safe every night. And we want our employees to have good working conditions while they're employed by McWane.
Editor's note: The public record reveals that McWane has been cited 221 times by OSHA since our original publication and broadcast. Unlike its previous record, none of the proposed citations was for a "willful" violation, the most serious category under OSHA regulations. OSHA has asked for $1,063,450 in fines. One high fine of $68,000 occurred at Kennedy Valve in Elmira, New York for OSHA violations described in a press release as conditions that could "expose employees to the dangers of fire, lacerations, amputation, chemical burns, crushing, falls, and eye, face and hand injuries."Read the OSHA release.
In the past five years, according to McWane's accounting submitted to FRONTLINE, there have been more than 3,800 injuries at their plants around the country, but most were relatively minor. Additionally, there have been two deaths at McWane foundries. In February 2004, Timothy Blow was decapitated when he fell into a sand-sifting machine at Kennedy Valve in Elmira, New York. During a related inspection, OSHA proposed penalties of $17,000, but for violations, the company said, were not directly related to the machine that killed Mr. Blow. In January 2005, Thomas Lawlor -- an employee at Atlantic States Cast Iron in Phillipsburg, New Jersey -- was crushed to death when a pipe rolled off a platform. OSHA cited the company for violating exit standards and fined Atlantic States $7,000. Mr. Lawlor's relatives are currently suing McWane in civil court.
In interviews, McWane's EHS executives and their primary OSHA consultant and auditor, Pat Tyson, argued that many of the citations reflected improved record keeping. Mr. Tyson cited a University of Michigan study that concluded that as many as 40 percent of workplace injuries go unreported. He and the others say that improved procedures and record keeping result in "a surge in the increase in injuries and illnesses" temporarily. They point out that virtually all of McWane's injury rates both here and in China are below the industry average.

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]




Vulcan statue at the center of Vulcan Park, Birmingham, Alabama.


The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]




Vulcan statue at the center of Vulcan Park, Birmingham, Alabama.


The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

History[edit]
J. R. McWane founded the McWane Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1921 in Birmingham, Alabama, where it has maintained its headquarters since. McWane introduced innovations to foundry technology and processes. He also introduced progressive initiatives to improve working conditions.[5] In 1920, one year before the founding of McWane, J.R. McWane wrote, "The industry that maintains an army of workers without regard to their working and living conditions, their health, recreations, religious and social life cannot succeed in the largest sense."[6] His vision is referred to within the company as "The McWane Way",[7] and can be summarized as aiming to improve both the methods of work and the lives of the workers, rather than focusing only on financial gain.[6]
However, by 2002 media investigations by The New York Times and others revealed serious workplace safety and environmental violations. Fines and criminal convictions followed.[8] As a result, reforms are reported to have been made.
In 2006, McWane’s Atlantic States plant in New Jersey became the first foundry in North America to apply technology to substantially limit mercury emissions. The following year, a McWane plant was the first iron and brass foundry in the country to be recognized as a Voluntary Protection Program site by OSHA.[9]
Growth and expansion[edit]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown mainly through acquisition of other domestic foundries and related enterprises. In 1926, the company opened its first subsidiary, the Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Company. Later, McWane acquired Empire Coke Company in 1962, Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company in 1975, and Union Foundry Company in 1977. Between 1984 and 1996, the company continued its expansion with the acquisition of the following companies, M&H Valve Company, Clow Water Systems, Clow Valve Company, Kennedy Valve Company, Tyler Pipe and Anaco. In 1999, McWane bought two more companies: Manchester Tank & Equipment of Brentwood, Tennessee and Amerex Corporation of Trussville, Alabama, expanding its manufacturing of fire extinguishers.[10][11]
Along with McWane's original operations, the subsidiary companies acquired by the company formed its seven divisions: ductile iron pipe, waterworks valves and fire hydrants,[10] soil pipe, soil fittings and utility fittings,[12][13] propane and compressed air, fire extinguishers, and coal.[14]
International expansion[edit]
McWane's international expansion began in 1989 when it acquired Canada Pipe Company, in Hamilton, Ontario, an iron pipe plant owned by Canron Inc. of Toronto.[15] After entering the Canadian market in 1989, McWane established Clow Canada in 1990, with manufacturing operations in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Saint John operation had operated as Thomas McAvity & Company between 1834 and 1960 before it was sold to Crane Canada Ltd.[16] Through Canada Pipe, McWane also acquired the Bibby Companies in 1997. McWane then extended its operations to Australia in 1999 with the acquisition of Manchester Tank & Equipment Company.[10] In 2005, the company built a new foundry, the Tyler Xian Xian Foundry Company, in Hebei, China[11] and in 2010, McWane acquired Manchester Tank & Equipment Cemcogas SA in Santiago, Chile.[17] Finally, through Amerex, McWane acquired Solberg Scandinavian AS, an independent firefighting foam agent manufacturer based in Bergen, Norway.[18]
China[edit]
In 2003, in response to increasing pressure to move operations overseas due to competition from importers, McWane filed a petition with the International Trade Commission asking for relief from Chinese competition. The commission unanimously approved McWane’s petition and recommended that President George W. Bush impose a three-year import quota on China's waterworks fittings and tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports exceeding the quota. However, in March 2004, President Bush decided not to adopt the commission's recommendation.[12] Following this decision, McWane opted to begin manufacturing its products both domestically and overseas. To that end, in 2005, it opened a plant in China's Hebei Province. The company was named the "Excellent Environmental Protection Facility of 2006" by the Cangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau.[19]
Environmental and safety issues[edit]
Following McWane's rapid growth in the 1990s, it was reported that the company had an increased number of health and safety violations.[20] In 2003, a series of joint print and broadcast reports by the New York Times, PBS and the Canadian Broadcast Corporation reported serious safety and environmental problems at McWane plants. According to the reports, there were 4,600 recorded injuries, nine deaths and more than 400 Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations between 1995 and 2003.[21]
Criminal and civil violations[edit]
Following the media reports, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched an intensive investigation into McWane’s safety and environmental practices.[22] Federal regulators brought formal charges against McWane facilities and managers, resulting in $25 million in fines and prison sentences of up to 70 months for four McWane plant managers.[9][23] Regulators also charged McWane with more than 400 air and water quality violations. The company resolved the bulk of the environmental violations in 2010, when it agreed to pay $4 million in civil penalties and spend another $9.1 million on environmental projects in communities near its plants.[24] This agreement covered 28 of the company's manufacturing facilities in 14 states, and resolves violations including the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and three other federal acts.[23] McWane President Ruffner Page Jr. said the agreement was "the beginning of the final chapter" in McWane's effort to be in full compliance.[25]
PBS Frontline aired an updated version of "A Dangerous Business", entitled "A Dangerous Business Revisited", on 5 February 2008 on most PBS stations throughout the U.S. Included in this version was additional reporting regarding federal prosecutions against McWane, Inc. since the original airing, as well as checking the OSHA data to verify whether McWane, Inc.'s new safety standards have made working conditions truly safer for its foundry employees.[26]
Commitment to safety and environment[edit]
Prior to the media reports, the company had been implementing changes to its operating practices since 2000, according to McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page.[20] Following the 2003 investigations, McWane continued to reform its safety and environmental practices, bringing on new management and implementing new safety procedures. The company replaced 90 percent of its senior management and added 125 new environmental, health and safety, and human resources positions since 1999.[27] In addition, McWane spent over $300 million on environmental protection and health and safety (EHS), and implemented a centralised EHS management system to detect environmental, and health and safety problems.[28] It also began self-reporting oversights to authorities.[29] McWane updated its Ethics and Compliance Policy and created a training and educational program for EHS and management skills. To ensure legal compliance, the company implemented oversight mechanisms and incentive schemes, including internal and external (third party) audits and a financial incentive program for managers based upon EHS performance, an appropriate range of disciplinary actions for noncompliance, along with a confidential, 24-hour phone line for reporting suspected violations and other concerns.[30]
Independent review and recognition[edit]
In a 2006 letter to the EPA, international president of the United Steelworkers Leo Gerard wrote that McWane's current management ”has shown a dramatic change in attitude” and that “current safely practices at McWane are as good as or better than any of its competitors."[9] During sentencing of the company in a case regarding environmental damages in New Jersey, U.S. District Court Judge Mary Cooper concluded, "A night and day difference has been accomplished, not by wishful thinking, but by determined and sustained effort at all levels. They are determined to continue to serve in all the ways that they serve and to do everything they can to prevent environmental, health, and safety damage to anyone."[31]
As a result of the changes implemented by McWane, the company, and its operating divisions and subsidiaries have received local and national recognition and awards. The company's Union Foundry has won safety awards, including Alabama's highest safety award from the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations.[9][13] The company's Pacific States plant received both the Utah Department of Environmental Quality’s Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention Award and the Provo/Orem Chamber of Commerce’s "Business of the Year" award in 2007.[9] In 2008, the Birmingham Business Journal named McWane president G. Ruffner Page as its Green Business Leader of the Year. as of 2010[update], seven McWane plants have been admitted into OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a program that recognizes exemplary health and safety programs, and a status that fewer than 1% of all U.S. workplaces attain.[32]
Philanthropy[edit]




Vulcan statue at the center of Vulcan Park, Birmingham, Alabama.


The McWane family and company is noted for its charitable work in Alabama and in communities where its plants are located. The family pledged $10 million to the McWane Science Center, and they have also donated to cultural institutions such as the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The company offers undergraduate scholarships to Alabama college students. The McWane family also donated $2 million to the 1999 restoration of the Birmingham’s famous Vulcan statue, which was originally cast in 1904 by J. R. McWane’s foundry[5][33] and is the largest cast iron statue in the world.[34] The Alabama Chapter of Fundraising Professionals awarded McWane its Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year Award in 2005. The city of Birmingham has also recognized McWane several times for its beautification and summer arts programs.[9] In 2009, the McWane Foundation pledged $5 million to Alabama’s Children’s Hospital for the construction of an environmentally friendly hospital. In addition to the gift from the McWane Foundation, Phillip and Heather McWane personally pledged an additional $5 million for a clinical program in the new hospital.[35]
Outside of Alabama, McWane's subsidiaries have contributed to charitable causes and community resources,[36][37] including a $30,000 donation to the Community Health and Mahaska Hospice for the renovation of the former Family Medical Center building, now called the Mahaska Health West building by the Clow Valve Company.[38] In 2008, the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co. donated $75,000 to upgrade the Walters Park band shell in Phillipsburg, New Jersey.[39]
According to Federal Election Commission data, McWane Inc. was the top contributor to then-Senator Jeff Sessions' campaign committee from 2011 to 2016.[40]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
