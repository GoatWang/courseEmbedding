more ▼DiscussionHistoryBookmarkPrintWIKI ANALYSIS TOP CONTRIBUTORSBrian DunneThomas ShyrRegal Entertainment Group (NYSE:RGC) manages the largest movie theater chain in the US. At the end of fiscal 2009, Regal Entertainment operated 6,768 movie screens in 548 theaters in 39 states and the District of Columbia.[1] It had over 244 million attendees, and has theaters in all of the top 30 U.S. designated market areas. 
The movie theater industry is highly competitive due to the large number of players and the lack of control theater companies have on suppliers. In addition, Regal Entertainment's movie theaters must compete with in-home theater services, television movie providers and other forms of entertainment such as sporting events and music concerts.  
To combat such competition, Regal Entertainment and other theater chains, such as AMC Entertainment and Cinemark USA have moved to the megaplex theater format. Today, Regal Entertainment has an average screen/theater ratio of 12.1, which is about twice the industry average. By providing a centralized location for multiple screens, Regal capitalizes on  economies of scale by minimizing labor and concession costs.  
Regal Entertainment’s revenues are directly tied to the success of the films that its theaters show. Regal Entertainment’s value is also contingent upon the financial wellbeing of National CineMedia, Inc., the largest digital in-theater advertising network in the US. Regal holds a 22.6% interest in the advertising firm, and NCM’s  IPO in 2007 provided Regal Entertainment with $447.4 million in net cash flow.

  Business Overview 
  Geographic Breakdown 
Regal Entertainment operates in 39 states and Washington, DC.  The company has locations in the top 30 US designated markets and 44 of the top 50.[1] Regal specifically targets mid-sized metropolitan areas and high-growth suburbs of large metropolitan areas as locations for acquisition or development.

  Financials 
Theater chains have compensated for declining movie attendance in recent years by increasing ticket and concession prices.  This has been successful in keeping revenues  steady, as Regal Entertainment's revenues have continued to climb in the 2-3% range over the past 4 years.
Revenues come predominantly from ticket and concession sales, and in 2009 Regal posted total revenues of $2.89 billion, compared to its 2008 revenue of $2.77 billion. As a result of this increase in revenues, Regal's net income increased as well. For 2009, Regal had total net income of $95 million, compared to the previous year's $73 million.

 Trends and Forces
 Regal's Revenues Rely on the Popularity of Films
A movie theater company's success is tied closely to the quality of the films that it shows. For example, in 2009 the movie film industry produced multiple hits including Avatar, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Up, Twilight Saga: New Moon, The Hangover among others. As a result, for the first time ever U.S. box office revenues were more than $10 billion. As a result, 2009 attendance volume increased by over 10%, resulting in gains in revenue as well as net income.

  Success of National CineMedia, Inc. Impacts Regal Entertainment 
Regal Entertainment has a 22.6% interest in  National CineMedia, Inc., the largest digital in-theater advertising network in the US. NCM IPO'ed in 2007, selling 38 million shares of common stock for $21 per share.[2]  Despite the selling of shares to the public, Regal Entertainment retained its position as the largest corporate investor in NCM (more than AMC Entertainment and Cinemark USA).  
Regal Entertainment has contractual agreements with NCM that will impact Regal Entertainment's revenues in the future.  For instance, NCM pays Regal Entertainment an $800 per digital theater and $0.07 per patron access fee.

  Rising Movie Prices Will Add Revenues per Ticket but may Drive Away Customers 
The prices of movie tickets and concession items have been rising dramatically.  This may be to compensate for declining ticket sales and other revenue-generating factors.  The price increases are also due to higher transportation costs (due to rising  oil prices), pressure to remain competitive in the industry, and rising inflationary pressures.[3]    Ticket price increases have offset revenue-losses due to declining attendance. However, too much of a price increase will cause attendance to decline to the point of revenue losses. 

  Digitization of Theaters will Improve the Movie-Going Experience 
One of the primary ways that Regal Entertainment and other industry leaders are attempting to corner larger market share is through investment in digital projection theaters.  Regal Entertainment will begin digitizing its theaters in the second quarter of 2008.  Two new theaters have already successfully been built with digital projection capabilities and Regal Entertainment hopes to be finished upgrading to digital technology within three to four years.  To finance this investment, Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, and Cinemark USA have set up a joint venture called Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC.  DCIP is still in the process of finalizing finance plans. Regal Entertainment sees the upgrade to digital projection theaters as a growth opportunity through both increased quality and the compatibility of digital projection with 3D and IMAX format movies. Since both AMC Entertainment and Cinemark are also upgrading theaters, installing digital theaters is a capital expense that will not differentiate Regal Entertainment's brand from others.  Though the investment will not provide additional value from an enhanced product, it will keep Regal Entertainment competitive, thus protecting against a deterioration of market value.

  Competition 
Regal Entertainment, along with other theater chains, faces substantial competition from other theater chains, in-home movie services, television movie providers and from other forms of entertainment.  Because the theater industry is so competitive, individual theater companies have little influence over suppliers. The movie theater industry is top-heavy: the largest 5 companies (Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment,  Cinemark USA,  Carmike Cinemas, and National Amusements) control 45% of the market share while the next 5 only control 8%. National Amusements is a private company.

  How is Regal Entertainment Different? 
As the largest theater chain, Regal Entertainment operates with the greatest economies of scale and thus the highest operating margins of any theater company.

  How is Regal Entertainment Similar? 
Below the largest companies, the movie theater industry is fragmented and highly competitive.  Few  barriers to entry exist and studies have shown that consumers are not loyal to a particular company; instead, moviegoers base their decisions off of proximity, the films showing, and amenities.[4]  For this reason, the movie theater industry   lacks expansion opportunities, especially in the growth of internal operations. Regal Entertainment's growth potential lies primarily through acquisition, which will allow it to tap new markets.

Act On Key Analyst Price Target Shifts: Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI)

By Homer Porter -   July 24, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Regal Entertainment Group (NYSE:RGC) observed rebound of 4.14% since bottoming out at $18.85 on Jul. 18, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.24% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -4.71% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -20.81% from $24.79 , the 52-week high touched on Nov. 17, 2016, but are collecting gains at -15.64% for the past 12 months.
RGC Target Price Reaches $21.85
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Regal Entertainment Group (RGC)’s shares projecting a $21.85 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Regal Entertainment Group (RGC)’s Sales Grew?
 RGC’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 3.6% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 4.3% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Regal Entertainment Group net profit margin for the 12 months is at 5.51%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 12.31%, and the sector’s average is 11.8%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -45.65% since hitting a peak level of $28.48 on Dec. 19, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 13.66% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -43.46% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 31.19% higher from $11.8, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on May. 22, 2017, but are collecting gains at -41.69% for the past six months.
Analysts See AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. 3.62% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI) to grow. At recent closing price of $15.48, AFSI has a chance to add $3.62 or 23.39% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($19.1) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.7 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 1.17 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 12.7%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 10.25%, annually.
Is AFSI Turning Profits into Returns?
 AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (AFSI)’s ROE is 12.32%, while industry’s is 9.18%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.81%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.’s ROA is 1.75%, while industry’s average is 1.59%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.54. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Reliance Group of CompaniesSM










Our Company 
How it all started...



Reliance Group of CompaniesSM 
old headquarters in 2010.


Making oilfield hose assemblies in Canada was Leo Farley’s vision and concept of Reliance when he and Mike Sirois teamed up to open the doors in 1993.
Before 1993, one could only order factory made rotary hose from the U.S. and abroad. If you didn’t carry your own inventory this meant you had to wait. High cost and downtime were a large concern for many oilfield  companies. Then enters Reliance Industrial, making custom, hand built hose assemblies in whatever length and application you need it for. Reliance provides what you need when you need it; with higher quality product, higher quality service, competitive prices, and a genuine concern for you and your company’s needs.
Today, Reliance continues the tradition of innovation and leadership in the industry. We have expanded from our main Nisku operation to have 17 branches throughout western Canada and the USA.



Reliance Group of CompaniesSM opens  its doors in our new Nisku headquarters in the fall of 2011.
