                            In 1908, a coin flip landed Charles W. Lamar the opportunity of a lifetime. Over the course of the next century, Lamar and his descendants built Lamar Advertising from a small sign company into one of the largest out-of-home advertising companies in the nation. Explore our interactive timeline to learn more about the history of Lamar and the out-of-home advertising industry.

Explore this area to see our giving back initiatives in action.

            What is a Bulletin?












                A Bulletin is the largest standard-sized billboard that delivers maximum exposure to vehicular traffic on expressways, highways and primary arteries. Typically 14 feet high and 48 feet wide, a bulletin provides 672 square feet of space for your ad. Bulletins offer unparalleled visibility.

Large-format advertising structures located on major highways, expressways and primary arteries
Visible to drivers, commuters and long distance travelers
Command your audience’s attention with creative three-dimensional designs, moving parts and extensions












                        Features & Specs








                        Prime Location



Permanent Bulletins often point travelers to the nearest exit for restaurants, lodging and fuel.



Permanent Bulletins remain in high density locations for maximum advantage. They build familiarity with your brand, so customers will think of you when making purchasing decisions. With our Permanent Bulletin package, your ad remains at one fixed location throughout the duration of your campaign (usually one to 12 months).




                        3D Billboard Extensions







Extend your creative into the next dimension with custom 3D extensions.



                            Take your billboard design to the next level by adding three-dimensional embellishments. Lamar Advertising produces custom 3D objects at its printing facility in Baton Rouge. Share your ideas with a Lamar rep, and they will guide you through every step of the process.




                        Amplified Design



Plywood and adhesive vinyl extensions transformed this Bulletin into a larger-than-life drill.



                            Boost the impact of your ad with an extension or “cutout” that goes beyond the rectangular space of the billboard. Add creative extensions up to 5 feet at the top, 2 feet at the side and one foot at the bottom. Extensions are available in the following formats: inflatables, mold making, steel, wood, foam and fiberglass.




                        Cover More Ground



A Rotary Bulletin package gives you a geographic and demographic advantage: you'll cover more ground and reach more people.



                            Reach more people and refresh your audience by periodically moving your advertisement. With our Rotary Bulletin package, we move your advertisement from one Bulletin location to another at stated intervals (usually every 60 to 90 days) within a particular market.










        Spec Sheets
Specs vary by market. Please contact your local Lamar office for availability and specifications.

                        Client Stories










"I used billboards as part of my advertising plan during my first year of taking over the business I saw a business increase of 10%. With continued use of the billboards the second year business increased 25% to 30%."


                                    Kelly Daniel
                                

                                    Owner, Rent All of Glynn, Inc.
                                






"We have found that outdoor advertising is responsible for 27.5% of sales. We also found that outdoor is the most cost effective advertising media that we use."


                                    Scott A. Smiley
                                

                                    General Sales Manager, Lexus of South Atlanta
                                






"I can't think of any other form of media these days that has the impact of outdoor marketing because every other outlet such as TV, radio and online marketing has become over saturated with options. It certainly has been for us, thanks Lamar!"


                                    Mitch Hedlund
                                

                                    Executive Director, Recycle Across America
                                






"I have noticed a significant increase in my sales since I have started using billboard signs.Customers and other businesses ask me about my signs daily."


                                    Tonya Mazurek
                                

                                    Jack & Jill’s Children Clothing Shoppe
                                






"We quickly found that our first billboard was worth the investment by the increased call volume, leads and eventually sales. Due to the response, we quickly added an additional two boards with two more planned before the end of the year."


                                    Gene Pridham
                                

                                    Operations Manager, BMP (Bessemer Metal Products)
                                






"Lamar’s outdoor campaigns have been a huge asset in helping us get our message out. We often ask our visitors and member, 'How did you hear about this?' The answer was always, 'the billboard'."


                                    Sabrina Stamper
                                

                                    Director of Media Services, First Baptist Church of Lenoir City
                                






"The first day the billboard was up we got sales from the first customer who saw the billboard and came in, it cover[ed] the first two months rental charge. While the billboards were up we had new customers every single day."


                                    Mary Carboneau

"Once my first sign was posted, it was only 10 days before my first call and the closing on that house paid for my sign ten times over."


                                    Max Nolen

Lamar Advertising is an outdoor advertising company which operates billboards, logo signs, and transit displays in the U.S, Canada, and Puerto Rico.[1] The company was founded in 1902 by Charles W. Lamar and J.M. Coe, and is headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[2] The company has over 200 locations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. They have reportedly more than 325,000 displays across the USA.[3] Lamar Advertising Company became a real estate investment trust in 2014.[4]
History[edit]
Lamar Advertising Company was founded in 1902 by J.M. Coe and Charles W. Lamar. The Company became independent under its current name in 1908 in Pensacola, Florida, when Charles W. Lamar, Sr. and J.M. Coe decided to dissolve their three-year partnership using a coin toss to divide their assets. The Pensacola Opera House and the Pensacola Advertising Company that was created to promote it were to be divided between the two men. Charles W. Lamar lost the toss and was left with the less-lucrative poster company, which he renamed the Lamar Outdoor Advertising Company.[5]
The Pensacola Opera House was destroyed during Hurricane Four of the 1917 Atlantic Hurricane season, with the Saenger Theatre later built on the site.[6]
In January, 2016, Lamar purchased advertising rights in 5 major U.S. city markets from Clear Channel Outdoors for $458.5 million.[7]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.32      Net Money Flow ($)  1.06 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
