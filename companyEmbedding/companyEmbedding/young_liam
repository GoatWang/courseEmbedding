anthropocene, conference, infrastructure, performance, science fiction, workshop




On February 26th – March 1st Liam Young will be speaking and running a masterclass at the Sonic Acts 2015 festival: The Geologic Imagination.Inspired by geosciences, the 2015 Sonic Acts Festival zooms in on planet Earth. Fundamental to The Geologic Imagination is the thesis that we live in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Human activity has irreversibly changed the composition of the atmosphere, the oceans, and even the Earth’s crust. Humanity has become a geological force. Other speakers include Timothy Morton, Graham Harman, Alan Weisman, Jeff Vandermeer, Ben Bratton and many more.
Liam will also be running a masterclass titled Reimagining the Present, Scenes from a film that doesn’t exist that will explore traditional special effects tropes from science fiction and introduce the use of entry-level CGI, special effects, post-production film and animation techniques.

Tomorrow’s Thoughts Today_Fast Thoughts » Failed Architecture #10: Beyond Ruin
























Failed Architecture #10: Beyond RuinDarryl Chen, 11 06 13
critique, design, dystopia, europe, event, modernism, morality, research



Darryl Chen will be joining the final Failed Architecture event of the season. Also on the panel will be Ole Bouman, Matthias Bottger, Arjen Oosterman and Mark Studholme moving beyond ruin porn and blind futurism to discuss the benefits of failure.
Date: Thursday, June 13, 2013
Time: 20:00 – 23:00 (19:00 doors open)
Location: TrouwAmsterdam
Address: Wibautstraat 127, Amsterdam
Can we benefit from failure? Is there live after Modernism? Can dystopia be productive? Is there a future for architecture criticism?
In the last two years Failed Architecture has explored the dark and disastrous side of architecture, from long neglected industrial ruins and abandoned new towns to Britain’s riot-torn neighborhoods and the corporate takeover in sell-out-cities.
Throughout our series of talkshows ‘Failed architecture’ was almost unanimously, by architects and non-architects alike, regarded as an oxymoron: architecture itself cannot fail, people and politics are the main causes for malfunctioning buildings and areas. And (therefore) architects can never be held solely responsible for the criticism that their creations, rightly or wrongly, are exposed to.
During our season finale, the last talkshow before the summer, we move beyond the ruin porn and blind futurism of yesteryear and will bring a wide range of perspectives on the success of failure, the resilience of architecture and the architect’s responsibility in a ravaged world.

Liam Duffy Receives President’s Award for Leadership Roles with SC Bar Young Lawyers




6/29/2017

Each year the President of the South Carolina Bar Young Lawyers Division (YLD) recognizes members who have exemplified leadership and outstanding service that has been instrumental to the YLD’s success. Of the 4,200 members, only 20 Young Lawyers received the President’s Award this year. Liam Duffy, an associate with Rosen Hagood, was one of those recipients.

	Liam was recognized for his leadership as both the YLD representative for the 9th Judicial Circuit (Charleston and Berkeley counties), and as Co-Chair of the Courthouse Keys Committee. In those roles, Liam helped devise and implement a number of valuable initiatives and events dedicated to serving the public and members of the legal profession.

	This work included the creation of a new “Judicial Spotlight” column for the YLD’s flagship publication, organization of Cocky’s Reading Express youth literacy program, and collaboration on various fundraising, community outreach and professional development efforts. 

	In addition to his involvement with the South Carolina Bar, Liam is a member of the American Bar Association (ABA) where he serves as the Chair of the YLD’s Law Practice Committee. Liam’s practice at Rosen Hagood focuses on complex commercial litigation, trust and estate litigation, and business law.
