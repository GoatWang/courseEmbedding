For business owners
We make your business
work hard for you

Being a business owner is high-stakes stuff. You’ve spent years investing time and energy and ingenuity to grow your business. But what’s the long-range financial strategy?
We can help you create a strategy – or  refine an existing one and execute it with acumen. In the process, we’ll lead you through a handful of critical decisions that can transform your business into the valued asset you need it to be.
Throughout, you’ll work with a tight-knit team of experts, each of whom has practical mastery of the issues and opportunities you’re facing. We’ll apply our experience and expertise to create a disciplined financial plan that reflects the complexities of your situation -- including tax and investment strategies for your future succession or retirement.
Regardless of where you are in the life cycle of your business, it’s never too early to start planning. In fact, the earlier you start, the more innovative approaches we’re likely to come up with to help you maximize your business value and get where you want to go.
To start a dialogue, call COO Susan Dickson at 415-526-2900 or send email to susan@privateocean.com.

Planning 


Planning
We build you a well-oiled machine

Modern life is a little insane. Even people with “simple” situations have a lot of complicated, interrelated stuff to deal with. Things like:



Retirement 
Stock options 
Business succession
Taxes 
Charitable giving 




Asset protection and insurance 
Children’s education 
Investments 
Estate issues 



We can help you integrate some or all of these factors into a master plan. To do it, we analyze your situation with great sensitivity. We discuss philosophy, lifestyle, your goals for your family. Often we help you address — and resolve — complex, multi-dimensional, multi-generational issues.
Our process includes a thorough analysis of your current financial situation. We identify strengths and weaknesses. We uncover opportunities. And we educate you, so you really understand your options.
The plan that results is a financial expression of your vision. It gives you a newfound sense of clarity. And it provides a meaningful context for your investment strategy.
Get educated. Watch Chip Pyfer and Sarah Wotherspoon explain what planning can do for you.















Planning comes first
Before we invest your assets, we build you a custom financial plan. Learn more from principals and planners Chip Pyfer and Sarah Wotherspoon.

Investing
Individuals rarely get access to investing this sophisticated

We invest your assets using an academic-based discipline employed by major institutions. Led by Frank & Fred, our investment committee chairs, we employ a degree of rigor on your behalf that is rarely available to individual investors.
The investment strategy we create for you is rooted in research conducted at the University of Chicago, Yale, Stanford, MIT and other renowned academic institutions. The underlying theory is dense but, in its simplest terms, our system is a sophisticated type of asset allocation designed to capture the market’s historically reliable movement.
We invest for you according to these fundamental principles:

Use thoughtful financial planning to drive investment decisions.
Ground investment strategy in rigorous academic research, not Wall Street
trends.
Invest for the long term. Don’t time the market.
Create globally-diversified portfolios, the kind that have historically been shown
to reduce risk and improve return.
Minimize costs, taxes and turnover everywhere possible.

Our approach has been stress-tested by major universities and institutions, and validated by history. It creates a portfolio intended to maximize growth and stability, and minimize risk and emotion. You’re now free to invest emotion elsewhere.
