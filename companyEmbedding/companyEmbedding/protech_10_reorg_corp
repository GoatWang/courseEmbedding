	Exhibit
	10.2








	MEMBERSHIP
	INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENT




	 





	This
	Membership Interest Exchange Agreement made this as of the 20



	th



	day of
	December 2007 by and among between SFH I Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
	corporation, with a principal place of business located at 17395 N. Bay Road
	Suite 102 Sunny Isles, Florida 33160, (the “Company” or “the Corporation”),
	Pharmco, LLC, a Florida limited liability company with a principal place of
	business located at 901 North Miami Beach Blvd., North Miami Beach, Florida
	33162(“Pharmco"), together with each of the members of Pharmco (as hereinafter
	defined).








	Recitals:








	A.


	 


	The
	Corporation has offered to issue ten million shares of its common stock, $.0001
	par value (the "Common Stock), to the holders of Membership Interests of Pharmco
	(the "Pharmco Membership Holders") in exchange for their contribution to the
	Corporation of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Pharmco
	(the “Pharmco Membership Interests”).







	B.


	 


	The
	respective Boards of Directors of the Corporation and Pharmco have determined
	that, subject to the terms, conditions, agreements, representations and
	warranties set forth herein, the exchange contemplated herein will serve the
	general welfare and advantage of their respective businesses.







	C.


	 


	Subject
	to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Pharmco Members desire to

	The
	exchange is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 368 of the
	Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury Regulations promulgated
	thereunder and the interpretive rulings issued pursuant thereto.







	NOW,
	THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, as well as the mutual
	covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
	bound, hereby agree as follows:








	ARTICLE
	I






	EXCHANGE
	PROVISIONS










	1.1


	 


	 



	Contribution



	.







	Subject
	to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth:



	 





	(a)


	 


	Each
	Pharmco Member agrees to contribute, transfer, assign and convey at Closing
	all
	of their Pharmco Membership Interests to the Corporation, together with all
	other rights, claims and interests he or she may have with respect to Pharmco
	or
	its respective assets, and all claims he may have against its officers and
	directors, including, but not limited to, all rights to unpaid dividends and
	all
	claims and causes of action arising from or in connection with the ownership
	of
	Pharmco Membership Interests or its issuance, excluding any right, claim or
	interest of same arising under this Agreement or in connection with the
	transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Each Pharmco Member shall deliver
	to
	the Company at Closing all of his membership certificates representing the
	Pharmco Membership Interests.



	 




















	 







	(b)


	 


	The
	Corporation agrees to issue to each Pharmco Member the Member’s pro rata portion
	of the total number of Membership Interests to be issued to the Pharmco Members.











	(c)
	Attached hereto and marked Schedule 1.1 is a list of the Pharmco Members, the
	number of Membership Interests and/or their pro rata share in the outstanding
	Membership Interests each owns as of the date of this Agreement and the number
	of shares of Common Stock each will receive at Closing.









	1.2



	No
	Registration



	.











	(a)


	 


	Each
	of
	the Pharmco Members acknowledges and agrees that:







	(i)


	 


	The
	Common Stock to be issued to the Pharmco Members (the "Exchanged Corporation
	Stock") is being issued to Pharmco Members without registration under applicable
	federal and state securities laws in reliance upon certain exemptions from
	registration under such securities laws;











	(ii)


	 


	Each
	member has had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from
	the
	Corporation, Pharmco and their respective executive officers concerning their
	businesses and the Exchanged Corporation Stock and all such inquiries have
	been
	completed to his satisfaction;











	(iii)


	 


	Each
	certificate representing shares of the Exchanged Corporation Stock will bear
	a
	legend restricting its transfer, sale, conveyance or hypothecation, unless
	such
	Exchanged Corporation Stock is either registered under applicable securities
	laws or an exemption from such registration is applicable, and provided that
	if
	an exemption from registration is claimed, the Corporation may require an
	opinion of legal counsel that, as a result of such exemption, registration
	under
	the securities laws is not required to transfer, sell, convey or hypothecate
	such Exchanged Corporation Stock;











	(iv)


	 


	Each
	member shall not transfer any Exchanged Corporation Stock except in compliance
	with all applicable securities laws;







	(v)


	 


	Each
	member has a pre-existing personal or business relationship with the Company
	or
	its officers, directors, agents or controlling persons, and has relied, if
	at
	all, on the advice of such persons in electing to participate in the transaction
	herein contemplated and not on any representations of the Corporation other
	than
	those expressly set forth herein, or by reason of his business or financial
	experience could be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect his
	own
	interest in connection with the transaction;











	(vi)


	 


	Each
	member is acquiring the Exchanged Corporation Stock for his own account, for
	investment purposes only and not with a view to the sale or distribution
	thereof;











	(vii)


	 


	He
	has
	not received any general solicitation or general advertising regarding the
	acquisition of the Exchanged Corporation Stock;



	 




















	 





	(viii)


	 


	He
	is
	capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Common Stock
	because he is a sophisticated investor by virtue of his prior investments and
	has experience in investments similar in nature to the Common Stock, including
	investments in unlisted and unregistered securities, and has knowledge and
	experience in financial and business matters in general; and











	(ix.)


	 


	Each
	member agrees and understands that the terms and conditions of this Agreement
	were not negotiated in an arm’s length transaction as the manager of Pharmco is
	also the president of the Company.


	 









	1.6


	 


	 



	Closing



	.
	Consummation of the contemplated transaction shall take place on the date that
	all the conditions set forth herein are satisfied or waived by the appropriate
	parties at the offices of Jeffrey G. Klein, P.A., 2600 North Military Trail,
	Suite 270 Boca Raton, FL 33431 or at another time or place that is mutually
	agreeable to the parties hereto, or on such other date at such other time as
	may
	be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto (the
	"Closing").

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot

        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
