Benefits of Investing in Precious Metals ETFs 






 


														Cost Effective													
					
											Participate in the gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion markets without having to take physical delivery of the gold itself.					
									



 


														Accessible													
					
											ETFs can be bought and sold whenever the stock exchange is open as prices are quoted throughout the day.					
									



 


														Transparent													
					
											Unlike other investment vehicles, ETF constituents are published on a daily basis; this transparency makes it easier for the investor to see exactly what they own.					
									



 


														Simple													
					
											ETFs are listed and trade in a similar way as shares through the same brokers and platforms.					
									


 


Explore Precious Metals
Why should investors care about precious metals, and more importantly, why should they go to the trouble of allocating to this asset class? In short, the answer is potentially better risk-adjusted returns. Since 2000, investors in a basket of precious metals have benefited from relatively higher returns with lower risk7. Thanks to the low correlation to equities and fixed income that precious metals often exhibit, in many circumstances precious metals may provide a diversification benefit, helping to offset swings in equities and fixed income. Indeed, during severe market corrections, precious metals tend to perform positively, in some cases functioning as a hedge, and providing some measure of protection during selloffs.
At ETF Securities, we offer a broad suite of physically-backed precious metals exchange traded funds (ETFs) to help investors reach their investment goals. In certain environments, our commodities focused offerings below may provide diversification benefits in an effort to boost risk-adjusted returns.
