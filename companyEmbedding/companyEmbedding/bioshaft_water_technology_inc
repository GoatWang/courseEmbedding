Past News ReleasesRSS



Long Beach, CA (PRWEB)
March 22, 2014
 Bioshaft Water Technology, Inc. reported its financial results for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2014.
Bioshaft Water Technology, Inc. (the "Company" or "Bioshaft") recorded revenues of $1,731,477 during the nine months ended January 31, 2014 as compared with revenues of $408,753 during the nine months ended January 31, 2013, an increase of $1,322,724 or 324%. The increase in revenues during the current nine month period is a result of Bioshaft showing the ability to successfully design and install it  products, in addition to Bioshaft, expanding its relationships with domestic and international distributors who have increased the awareness of Bioshaft's products. 
"These are exciting times at Bioshaft, moving forward through 2014, we have completed the installation of a few Bioshaft waste water systems and established key relationships with distributors both domestically and international, which has increased the awareness of Bioshaft's products. Additionally, we feel that the state-of-the-art sustainable technology used within our products will help lead Bioshaft into the future as we have found our technology is the perfect fit for all sizes of customers all over the world," said Bashar Amin, Chief Executive Officer of Bioshaft, who has a leading role in developing the technology from the lab to the real world. 
Bioshaft is based in Southern California, and specializes in design and manufacturing of products in which remove water soluble organic compounds from both Industrial and Domestic Wastewater. Typical uses of Bioshaft's products include waste from households apartment complexes, labor camps, resorts, etc. Bioshaft's technologies enable industries with a range of medium to high strength wastewater to economically treat a variety of complex contaminants while achieving excellent bio and chemical oxygen demand reductions for discharge to publically owned treatment works and/or DPDES. The BioShaft System is a natural process that uses a sophisticated biofilm attached to an aerobic system in which utilizes naturally occurring microorganisms in the waste stream to rapidly breakdown, consume and ultimately remove up to 95% of the sludge.

The Company's principal product is a domestic waste-water treatment plant system. As of April 30, 2016, the Company has approximately 30 domestic waste water plants in use around the world that use the BioShaft technology, which is made using BioShaft unit. BioShaft unit works by emulating and accelerating a natural process found in rivers. The waste-water treatment plant system for which the Company uses its BioShaft unit is called the BioShaft System.The Company's BioShaft System consists of approximately four treatment phases with BioShaft unit used in the second treatment phase. The four treatment phases are Mechanical/Primary Treatment Phases (Pretreatment phase), which include delivery to the treatment, and screening and maceration; Biological/Secondary Treatment Phase, which includes balance tank (Aeration), BioShaft units and clarification; Tertiary Treatment Phase, which includes effluent disinfection, and Sludge Treatment, which includes biomass collecting tank (only for larger capacities for more than 10000 cubic meter/day). The Company's BioShaft System is an attached growth process for the biological treatment of the human (domestic) waste-water.The Company's turbo moving bed bio reactor (T-MBBR) BioShaft Packaged system is mobile and delivered ready for immediate installation. It is a pre-engineered, standard, packaged system designed as a domestic wastewater solution. The T-MBBR BioShaft Packaged System is an alternative that provides customers with installation and commissioning in the event of a sewage emergency situation. T-MBBR BioShaft System encompasses both the municipal and industrial sector made up primarily of food and beverage opportunities across the world. Its modular anoxic aerobic digester (MAAD) process by BioShaft integrates an anaerobic digestion tank with the T-MBBR System. The raw pre-screened wastewater undergoes partial treatment through the anaerobic tank before it is treated through the T-MBBR System. The MAAD System is also suited for wastewaters with variable composition and occasional spikes in the concentrations of certain compounds.The Company competes with GE/Zenon and Smith & Loveless.

Business Wire




Jul 12, 2012 12:01 PM EDT













 




























































  BioShaft Water Technology Inc. (OTCBB: BSHF) is expanding its product offering to include customers in the global industrial marketplace that require an efficient and cost-effective green wastewater solution.  “As an experienced technology services company with a solid track record in the design and manufacture of domestic, municipal wastewater treatment plants, we are uniquely positioned to fulfill global demand for total wastewater solutions for medium to high-strength industrial wastewater,’’ says Walter Zurawick, President of BioShaft.  To that end, BioShaft has differentiated itself in the marketplace by undertaking comprehensive reviews of each customer’s unique wastewater needs as BioShaft works closely with their clients to uncover ways to reduce risks and costs as the technology is:  • Well suited for special wastewaters with an unbalanced composition and occasionally toxic compounds (chemical industry)  • Economical compared to traditional technologies which are far too expensive and cumbersome  • Simplicity of System reduces O & M costs, and the system is simple to operate as there are minimal electromechanical components used in the process  • Convert waste by-products into valuable energy and clean recycled water  “The result is worry-free wastewater management,” stated Mr. Lee Hereford, President /CEO of Pedernales Brewing Company.  BioShaft has many proven applications worldwide and a number of recent industrial orders are operational including PBC Brewery in Fredericksburg, Texas, successfully installed and commissioned in April 2012.  Other notable orders include Kobelco-Eco, in Kobe, Japan, which has been treating Industrial medium/high strength wastewater utilizing the BioShaft Pilot Turbo MBBR for several months with exceptional results, and Delmon Poultry in Bahrain, currently in the installation phase and will be commissioned shortly.  About BioShaft Water Technology Inc.  BioShaft Water Technology Inc. is a publicly traded Lake Forest, California designer and manufacturer of domestic, municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants.
