P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    2.54      Net Money Flow ($)  125,079    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

We will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately US$173.0 
million, or approximately US$199.9 million if the underwriters exercise their 
option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$21.0 million for the repayment of a portion of our 
  outstanding indebtedness as described below;

• approximately US$135.6 million for development and acquisition of new data 
  centers;

• approximately US$11.4 million for the payment of preference dividends to 
  holders of our preferred shares; and

• the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

On September 17, 2015, our subsidiary Shenzhen Yungang EDC Technology Co., Ltd.,
entered into a term loan facility agreement with United Overseas Bank (China) 
Limited, Shenzhen Branch and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank 
(China) Limited for a principal amount of RMB430.0 million (US$64.7 million) for
the subsidiary's Shenzhen data centers SZ1 and SZ2 respectively, and an 
amendment agreement dated August 5, 2016 to extend an additional term loan 
facility with a principal loan amount of RMB100.0 million (US$15.0 million) for
financing the borrower's Shenzhen data center SZ3. The interest rate agreed 
under the term loan facility agreements is 1.2x or 1.3x of PBOC's base rate for
loans, as applicable. The effective interest rate on the loan as of the date of
this prospectus was 6.18% per annum. The maturity date of the loan is September
18, 2020. The proceeds from the loan are being used for the construction, 
renovation and fitting-out of, as well as equipment for, the premises of data 
centers SZ1, SZ2 and SZ3.

On October 28, 2015, our subsidiary Beijing Hengpu'an Data Technology
Development Co., Ltd. entered into a term loan facility agreement with United
Overseas Bank Limited for a principal amount of RMB120.0 million
(US$18.1 million) for financing borrower's Beijing data center (BJ1). The
interest rate agreed under said term loan facility agreement is a fixed rate of
6.5625% per annum or 1.25x of PBOC's base rate (as applicable based on the
tranches of facilities utilized under the agreement). The effective interest
rate on the loan as of the date of this prospectus was 6.56% per annum. The
maturity date of the loan is December 21, 2020. The proceeds from the loan are
being used for the construction, renovation and fitting-out of, as well as
equipment for, the premises of data center BJ1.

An aggregate RMB537.2 million (US$80.8 million) was outstanding on the foregoing
two loan facilities as of the date of this prospectus, approximately RMB139.2
million (US$21.0 million) of which we are required to repay upon the completion
of this offering. 

The foregoing represents our intentions as of the date of this prospectus with
respect of the use and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based 
upon our present plans and business conditions, but our management will have 
significant flexibility and discretion in applying the net proceeds of the
offering. The occurrence of unforeseen events or changed business conditions may
result in application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as
described in this prospectus.

To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds
in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we, as an offshore holding company,
are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our consolidated
VIEs only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government 
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our PRC 
subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or 
approvals on a timely basis, if at all.


We offer a broad range of data center services and, as a result, we may
compete with a wide range of data center service providers for some or all of
the services we offer.

We face competition from the state-owned telecommunications carriers, namely
China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile. As of December 31, 2015, these
carriers had a 59% share in aggregate of the high performance data center
services market in China based on area committed according to 451 Research. One
of the main purposes for which these carriers develop data centers is in order
to facilitate the sale of related telecommunications services. In locations
outside of the key economic hubs, these three carriers may sometimes be the only
available provider of data center services. We distinguish ourselves from these
carriers because we are carrier-neutral, enabling our customers to connect
within our facilities with all three carriers based on their cost and/or network
and application requirements. We compete on the basis of our data center
quality, operating track record and differentiated managed and cloud service
capabilities. Although we compete with carriers for colocation customers, our
customers also rely on the connectivity that carriers provide. We believe that
we also have a mutually beneficial relationship with these carriers since our
data center services often help carriers attract more customers for their
telecommunications services.

We also compete with other carrier-neutral data center service providers,
including:

• Domestic carrier neutral data center service providers. We compete with 
  domestic carrier-neutral data center service providers with a presence in some
  or all of our markets, such as Sinnet, Dr. Peng and 21Vianet. We believe that
  we are well positioned in terms of our operational track record and our
  ability to: deliver high-performance data center services in all key markets;
  maintain consistently high facility and service quality; continue capacity
  expansion in all key markets to accommodate growing demand; and provide
  differentiated managed service offerings with a unique value proposition.

• International carrier neutral data center service providers. We compete to a 
  lesser extent with foreign carrier-neutral data center service providers such
  as Equinix, KDDI and NTTCom, each of which has a presence in Shanghai and/or
  Beijing and primarily serve their international customers. We believe that we
  distinguish ourselves by our larger capacity and more extensive market
  presence across the key economics hubs in China, deep operating knowledge and
  long track record in the China market, and long-term relationships with the
  telecommunications carriers.


Company Description
We are a leading developer and operator of high-performance data centers in
China. Our facilities are strategically located in China's primary economic hubs
where demand for high-performance data center services is concentrated. Our data
centers have large net floor area, high power capacity,


 density and efficiency,
and multiple redundancy across all critical systems. We are carrier and cloud
neutral, which enables our customers to connect to all major PRC 
telecommunications carriers, and to access a number of the largest PRC cloud
service providers, whom we host in our facilities. We offer colocation and
managed services, including a unique and innovative managed cloud value
proposition. We have a 15-year track record of service delivery, successfully
fulfilling the requirements of some of the largest and most demanding customers
for outsourced data center services in China. Our base of approximately
370 customers consists predominantly of large Internet companies, financial
institutions, telecommunications and IT service providers, and large domestic
private sector and multinational corporations. As of September 30, 2016, we had
an aggregate net floor area of 48,822 sqm in service, 93.8% of which was
committed, and an aggregate net floor area of 37,194 sqm under construction.
According to 451 Research, an independent research firm, we are the largest
service provider in the high-performance carrier-neutral data center services
market in China, with 24.9% market share as measured by area committed as of
September 30, 2016.

The market for high-performance data center services in China is experiencing 
strong growth. According to 451 Research, the market is expected to increase 
from US$1.5 billion in 2015 to US$2.4 billion in 2018, representing a compound
annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 16.6%. Over the same period, the 
high-performance carrier-neutral data center services market in China is
expected to grow with a higher CAGR of 20.5%. Demand is driven by the confluence
of several secular economic and industry trends, including: rapid growth of the
Internet, e-commerce and big data; rising adoption of cloud computing and server
virtualization, which requires data centers with higher power capacity, density
and efficiency; increasing criticality of information technology and data in the
enterprise environment which requires data centers with higher reliability; and
growing reliance by enterprises on outsourcing as a solution to the increasing
complexity and cost of managing mission-critical IT infrastructure. We believe
that, as a result of this strong demand and the challenges of sourcing,
developing and operating new facilities that meet the required standard, there
is a relative scarcity of high-performance data center capacity in China.
According to 451 Research, as of December 31, 2015, when comparing the ratio of
square meters of colocation area in service to GDP, the U.S. had a ratio of 207
sqm per US$1 billion in GDP, while China only had a ratio of 107.

Our portfolio of data centers and secured expansion capacity are strategically
located to address this growing demand. We operate our datacenters to service 
our customers predominantly in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and 
Chengdu, the primary financial, commercial, industrial and communications hubs
in each region of China. According to 451 Research,approximately 90% of the 
market in terms of revenue for high-performance data center services in China
was concentrated in these markets in 2015. We have also established a presence
in Hong Kong which we believe is another important marketfor our customers. Our
data centers are located in close proximity to thecorporate headquarters and
key operation centers of many large enterprises,providing convenient access for
our customers. Furthermore, the extensive multi-carrier telecommunications
networks in these markets enable our customers to enhance the performance and 
lower the cost of connectivity to our facilities.

Our data centers are large-scale, highly reliable and highly efficient
facilities that provide a flexible, modular and secure operating environment in
which our customers can house, power and cool the computer systems and
networking equipment that support their mission-critical IT infrastructure. We
install large power capacity and optimize power usage efficiency, which enables
our customers to deploy their IT infrastructure more efficiently and reduce
their operating and capital costs. As a result of our advanced data center
design, high technical specifications and robust operating procedures, we are
able to make service level commitments related to service availability and other
key metrics that meet our customers' required standards.

We currently serve approximately 370 customers, including large Internet
companies, a diverse community of approximately 160 financial institutions,
telecommunications and IT service providers and large domestic private sector
and multinational corporations, many of which are leaders in their respective
industries. Within our customer base, we host a number of major cloud service
providers, including Aliyun, the cloud computing unit of Alibaba, which is
present in several of our data centers. Contracts with our large Internet
customers have terms of three to eight years, while contracts with our 
enterprise customers typically have terms of one to five years. We achieved an
average retention rate of over 95% per annum among our Internet and financial
institution customers for colocation services in our current data centers over
the past two years.

As of September 30, 2016, we operated eight self-developed data centers with
an aggregate net floor area of 39,781 sqm in service. We also operated capacity
at approximately ten third-party data centers with an aggregate net floor area
of 9,041 sqm in service, which we lease on a wholesale basis and use to provide
colocation and managed services to our customers. As of the same date, we had a
further five new self-developed data centers and two phases of an existing data
center with an aggregate net floor area of 37,194 sqm under construction. In
addition, we had an estimated aggregate developable net floor area of
approximately 20,000 sqm held for future development and entered into a
memorandum of understanding for a lease of three data center shell buildings
that we expect to provide us with additional net floor area of approximately
30,000 sqm. Our net revenue and results of operations are largely determined by
the degree to which data center space is committed or pre-committed as well as
its utilization. We had commitment rates of 76.3%, 87.5% and 93.8% as of
December 31, 2014 and 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. We had
utilization rates of 57.7%, 59.1% and 70.4% as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 and
September 30, 2016, respectively. The difference between commitment rate and
utilization rate is primarily attributable to customers who have entered into
agreements but have not yet started to use revenue generating services.
