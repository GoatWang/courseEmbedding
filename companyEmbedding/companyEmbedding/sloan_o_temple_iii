History[edit]
The CarQuest marketing alliance and distribution network was formed in 1974 by O. Temple Sloan of General Parts, Dan Bock of Bobro Products, and Joe Hughes of Indiana Parts Warehouse.[1][3][4] In response to competition from high-volume retail stores, Sloan believed "that programmed distribution through a cooperative alliance would be the most effective means to remain competitive." According to a 1994 Bangor Daily News article, "CARQUEST is made up of 14 distributing companies operating 64 CARQUEST Auto Parts Stores throughout the United States" at that time.[1]
General Parts was the largest member with General Parts owning 1,400 out of CarQuest’s 3,400 auto parts stores across North America by 2011.[5] O. Temple Sloan Jr. started General Parts in 1961.
Founding member Bobro was later sold to White Plains Automotive in 1984 and renamed B.W.P. Distributors. BWP was later acquired by Advance Auto in 2012. Dan Bock later served as president of Carquest.
Founding member Indiana Parts Warehouse was acquired by the third founder General Parts in 1991.[6] Indiana Parts had served 90 locations.
Carquest acquired Worldpac in 2004, but kept its operations separate.[7]
General Parts received $258 million in 2011 for selling 33 of the company’s distribution centers and office buildings in a long-term sale-leaseback deal.[5]
In June 2012, Carquest Auto Parts relaunched its Carquest.com Web site, offering buy online, pick up in store commerce.
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired warehouse distributor B.W.P. Distributors, which supplied the Northeast.[8] On October 16, 2013 it was announced that CARQUEST will be acquired by Advance Auto Parts, Inc in an all-cash transaction estimated at $2.04 billion dollars.[9] The deal was finalized on January 3, 2014.[10][11]
Stores[edit]

There are over 2,800 Carquest Auto Parts stores in North America[12][13] and one location in Northern Mariana Islands.
Carquest Canada has 200 stores in eastern Canada with supplied by distribution centers in Toronto, Montreal, and Saint John, New Brunswick.
WorldPac[edit]
WorldPac was formed in 1995 by the merger of WorldWide Trading Corp. (WWTC) and Imported Parts and Accessories (IMPAC).[14] WorldPac specializes in providing hard to find aftermarket parts for imported vehicles.
WorldPac was acquired by Carquest in 2004[7] and by Advance Auto Parts on January 2, 2014 when General Parts International was merged into Advance.
Sponsorships[edit]

CARQUEST was a partner with Barrett-Jackson and their auctions until 2014.
Carquest was the official auto parts supplier of Hendrick Motorsports until the end of the 2011 season. Kellogg's and Carquest announced on May 26, 2006 a unique three-year agreement with Hendrick Motorsports that secures the two companies as co-primary sponsors of the No. 5 Chevrolets driven by Kyle Busch in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
On September 9, 2007, the two companies announced Casey Mears will drive the No. 5 Kellogg's/Carquest Chevrolets for Hendrick Motorsports in the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, joining a team that secured its second consecutive Chase appearance Sunday, September 2, 2007 at California Speedway.
In 2008, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Mark Martin, a seasoned veteran would be driving the car in 2009. Carquest has continued to sponsor Mark Martin in 2010 and 2011. Carquest Auto Parts has primary sponsor placement in eight points races on the No. 5 Chevy driven by Mark Martin during the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup season.
Carquest Auto Parts joined Hendrick Motorsports in 2002 as an associate sponsor of Chevrolets driven by Ricky Hendrick in the NASCAR Busch Series. The relationship carried over to the following season, resulting in a NASCAR Busch Series championship with driver Brian Vickers, and has since transitioned into the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
The company sponsored the Carquest Bowl (now Russell Athletic Bowl) from 1994–1997, 3-time IHRA Drag Racing Top Fuel Champion Paul Romine from 1997–2004 and from 2001-2004 was associated with the No. 2 Team ASE NASCAR Craftsman Truck driven by Scott Riggs and Jason Leffler.

Temple Sloan of General Parts, Dan Bock of Bobro Products, and Joe Hughes of Indiana Parts Warehouse.[1][3][4] In response to competition from high-volume retail stores, Sloan believed "that programmed distribution through a cooperative alliance would be the most effective means to remain competitive." According to a 1994 Bangor Daily News article, "CARQUEST is made up of 14 distributing companies operating 64 CARQUEST Auto Parts Stores throughout the United States" at that time.[1]
General Parts was the largest member with General Parts owning 1,400 out of CarQuest’s 3,400 auto parts stores across North America by 2011.[5] O. Temple Sloan Jr. started General Parts in 1961.
Founding member Bobro was later sold to White Plains Automotive in 1984 and renamed B.W.P. Distributors. BWP was later acquired by Advance Auto in 2012. Dan Bock later served as president of Carquest.
Founding member Indiana Parts Warehouse was acquired by the third founder General Parts in 1991.[6] Indiana Parts had served 90 locations.
Carquest acquired Worldpac in 2004, but kept its operations separate.[7]
General Parts received $258 million in 2011 for selling 33 of the company’s distribution centers and office buildings in a long-term sale-leaseback deal.[5]
In June 2012, Carquest Auto Parts relaunched its Carquest.com Web site, offering buy online, pick up in store commerce.
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired warehouse distributor B.W.P. Distributors, which supplied the Northeast.[8] On October 16, 2013 it was announced that CARQUEST will be acquired by Advance Auto Parts, Inc in an all-cash transaction estimated at $2.04 billion dollars.[9] The deal was finalized on January 3, 2014.[10][11]
Stores[edit]

There are over 2,800 Carquest Auto Parts stores in North America[12][13] and one location in Northern Mariana Islands.
Carquest Canada has 200 stores in eastern Canada with supplied by distribution centers in Toronto, Montreal, and Saint John, New Brunswick.
WorldPac[edit]
WorldPac was formed in 1995 by the merger of WorldWide Trading Corp. (WWTC) and Imported Parts and Accessories (IMPAC).[14] WorldPac specializes in providing hard to find aftermarket parts for imported vehicles.
WorldPac was acquired by Carquest in 2004[7] and by Advance Auto Parts on January 2, 2014 when General Parts International was merged into Advance.
Sponsorships[edit]
CARQUEST is title right sponsor of the CARQUEST Auto Parts NHRA Nationals at Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park near Phoenix, Arizona. The event takes place annually in February and airs on FOX Sports 1.
CARQUEST was a partner with Barrett-Jackson and their auctions until 2014.
Carquest was the official auto parts supplier of Hendrick Motorsports until the end of the 2011 season. Kellogg's and Carquest announced on May 26, 2006 a unique three-year agreement with Hendrick Motorsports that secures the two companies as co-primary sponsors of the No. 5 Chevrolets driven by Kyle Busch in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
On September 9, 2007, the two companies announced Casey Mears will drive the No. 5 Kellogg's/Carquest Chevrolets for Hendrick Motorsports in the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, joining a team that secured its second consecutive Chase appearance Sunday, September 2, 2007 at California Speedway.
In 2008, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Mark Martin, a seasoned veteran would be driving the car in 2009. Carquest has continued to sponsor Mark Martin in 2010 and 2011. Carquest Auto Parts has primary sponsor placement in eight points races on the No. 5 Chevy driven by Mark Martin during the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup season.
Carquest Auto Parts joined Hendrick Motorsports in 2002 as an associate sponsor of Chevrolets driven by Ricky Hendrick in the NASCAR Busch Series. The relationship carried over to the following season, resulting in a NASCAR Busch Series championship with driver Brian Vickers, and has since transitioned into the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
The company sponsored the Carquest Bowl (now Russell Athletic Bowl) from 1994–1997, 3-time IHRA Drag Racing Top Fuel Champion Paul Romine from 1997–2004 and from 2001-2004 was associated with the No. 2 Team ASE NASCAR Craftsman Truck driven by Scott Riggs and Jason Leffler. It also sponsored NHRA drag races from 2003 - 2007.

RALEIGH, N.C.  General Parts International Inc. (GPI) President and CEO O. Temple Sloan, III today announced that CARQUEST U.S. President Mike Broderick has decided to leave the company. As previously reported, Broderick has joined Federal-Mogul Corp. as the company’s global aftermarket CEO.    In the interim, Sloan will assume responsibility for the CARQUEST U.S. business, and David McCartney, executive vice president and chief information officer (CIO) for GPI Technologies will lead Information Technology and Supply Chain operations.     “David’s management experience and knowledge of the industry makes him the right person for this position,” Sloan said. “With over 20 years in leadership of distribution operations, including warehousing, transportation and customer service functions, David will have an immediate impact on supply chain operations.”   Ken Bush has been promoted to senior vice president merchandising and marketing, and Braxton O’Neal has been promoted to senior vice president, global product supply, both reporting directly to Sloan.   Bush, who will lead merchandising and marketing, joined CARQUEST in July 2006 as vice president, national account sales, and transitioned to division vice president, store operations & sales, and most recently, vice president of merchandising.  Bush has more than 24 years in the industry, in various positions including merchandising, store operations and commercial sales and operations.   In his new role, O’Neal will lead purchasing, inventory management, pricing, classification, product information and global sourcing. With more than 34 years’ experience in the automotive aftermarket, O’Neal has been with CARQUEST for the past 25 years. During that time, he has held leadership roles in merchandising, global sourcing, pricing and margin management, inventory management, purchasing, store point of sale systems, business sponsorship and development of auto parts systems and applications.

I had a few hours with O. Temple Sloan Jr. about five months ago when he and his real estate friends took me back in history to chronicle the rise of Raleigh.
After all, Sloan who made his money and garnered his influence mostly from General Parts International, is also one of the largest real estate investors Raleigh has ever seen.

What struck me about this 74-year-old quiet and proud man who started General Parts back in 1961 was his ability to shape the conversation.
When we started talking about General Parts, his son O. Temple Sloan III and all the financial pressures engulfing the auto parts industry, Sloan swiftly pivoted the conversation about how people and leadership qualities are the cornerstone of a successful manager and a profitable company.
Nobody knows how much the Sloan family would make out of this $2 billion deal with Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP), but I am guessing it is substantial. Did the Sloan family just become the Triangle’s next billionaires?
If so, that’s a good thing.
I say that by looking at what Sloan has done in the past. He is acutely aware of the needs of the community, and as his friends and business partners Steve Stroud (owner of NAI Carolantic) and Roddy Jones (founder of Davidson & Jones) recently told me, much of Sloan’s good deeds are never publicized because he wants to keep it that way.
“In so many ways, Temple is a private man,” Jones said recently.
But don’t mistake being private with being apathetic or not being vocal.




 


Sloan, an avid reader, could challenge the thinking of the most-established business leader. So, I can only imagine when Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) was doing the deal with Advanced Auto Parts, the finance guys had to be on their “A” game. Temple Sloan Jr. has never shown much patience for ignorance and mediocrity.
There is one other thing you should know about Sloan — he is not going to sit on his glory and see the days pass by.

He has an investment firm, Trail Creek Investments, through which much of his real estate dealings take shape. Expect him to continue to look for deals and continue the expansion of his portfolio.
Temple is a student of worker and customer behavior, and always tries to find an edge in business because he worked that much harder than the competition.
I remember when we were talking, he brought up the fact that one of his executives sent him a chart that looked deeper into the "generational differences in the workplace." The chart shows how workers from different generation (Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millenials, etc. ) behave and react to change, work environment, leadership style and money.
He still has a lot of gunpowder left in him.
I am sure we will hear about his next venture soon.

RALEIGH, N.C.  General Parts International Inc. (GPI) President and CEO O. Temple Sloan III today announced that David McCartney, executive vice president, chief information officer (CIO) for GPI Technologies LLC, has been named president of CARQUEST U.S. McCartney will report directly to Sloan.    McCartney succeeds Michael Broderick as president of CARQUEST U.S. It was announced last week that Broderick took the position of CEO, Global Aftermarket Division at Federal-Mogul Corp.   “David has over 20 years of experience and leadership in the automotive aftermarket, which makes him a perfect match for this position,” said Sloan.  “In his many years with the company, David has gained broad knowledge and expertise in all aspects of the business.”   McCartney has served as executive vice president, CIO, since February 2011. Prior to that time, he served as senior vice president, supply chain and logistics. Other positions held include divisional vice presidentCentral Region, divisional vice presidentWestern Region and senior vice president of DC operations.   In 1985, while attending college, McCartney joined the company as a JV store teammate and then transferred to the Raleigh Distribution Center. There, he held positions in all distribution disciplines. Upon completion of his degree, he entered the company’s management trainee program. McCartney took leadership over several DCs acquired by GPI. He was responsible for many mergers and acquisitions, as well as startups for DC operations. McCartney earned a bachelor’s degree in business management from North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C.   In conjunction with McCartney’s appointment, GPI announced that Todd Bolon, senior vice president of GPI Technologies, will lead the technologies organization and report directly to McCartney. Bolon joined GPI in May 2011 from LabCorp in Burlington, N.C., where he held multiple vice president positions in the information technology (IT) group.   Prior to LabCorp, Bolon was vice president and chief information officer at Railinc, a leader in technology-based innovation for the freight rail industry, located in Cary, N.C. Earlier in his career, Bolon held technology leadership positions at General Electric, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Sea-Land Service.   “Given his vast information technology experience, Todd is an asset to the IT organization,” said McCartney. “He will help to ensure we continue on the path of providing technology excellence to the organization, our customers and other CARQUEST members.”     Bolon earned an MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and a bachelor of science in commerce from the University of Virginia.
