	Wall
	Street Media Co, Inc.










	Notes
	to Condensed Financial Statements






	March
	31, 2017









	 





	Note
	1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 





	Nature
	of Operations





	 




	Wall
	Street Media Co, Inc. (the “Company” or “Wall Street Media”) was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com,
	Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 26, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its name to My Catalogs Online, Inc. and
	in November 2012, it changed its name to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. In August 2013, the Company changed its name
	to Wall Street Media Co, Inc.




	 




	Wall
	Street Media is situated within the consulting services sector, and looks to expand its services to companies of the utmost quality.
	Wall Street Media chooses to implement its efforts within the consulting sector because of the need for quality evaluation of
	the growing start-up marketplace. The Company believes that it now has the means to detect and attain the best companies
	with the most beneficial services to be provided.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation






	 





	The
	interim unaudited condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, pursuant to the rules and
	regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In the opinion of the Company’s management,
	all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to
	present fairly the results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2017, and the financial position as
	of March 31, 2017, have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating
	results to be expected for the full year. Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial
	statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim condensed financial statements. Accordingly, these interim condensed
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in our Report
	on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on December 12, 2016. The March 31, 2017 balance sheet is derived from those financial
	statements.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	financial statements are prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
	 These accounting principles require the Company to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions.  The Company
	believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which it relies are reasonable based upon information available at
	the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made.  These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the periods presented.  The financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences
	between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically
	dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application.  There are also areas in which management’s
	judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.  Significant estimates include
	the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents






	 





	The
	Company considers financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.




	 







	 



	6



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	In
	accordance with ASC 605-10, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to
	and accepted by the customer, economic risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection
	is reasonably assured, and any future obligations of the Company are insignificant. These criteria are generally met during the
	period when the development or consulting services are provided or completed.




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Net Income per Common Share





	 




	Basic
	net income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
	the period.  Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of
	common shares outstanding for the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially
	dilutive securities consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock
	options and convertible debt instruments.  Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect
	is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of March 31, 2017.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	The
	Company does not believe these are any new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on
	its Condensed financial statements.




	 





	Note
	2 - Going Concern





	 




	As
	reflected in the accompanying financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company reported net losses
	of $1,644 and $19,142, respectively, and provided cash from operating activities of $744 and cash used in operating activities
	of $36,818 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the Company has a working capital deficit of $95,479 at March 31, 2017.
	Lastly, 100% of the Company's revenue is generated from a related party. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's
	ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery
	of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to implement
	its business plan and continue as a going concern.  In addition, the Company is actively seeking investor funding.

	From
	time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.
	As of March 31, 2017, there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect
	on our results of operations.




	 





	Note
	5 – Concentrations





	 




	During
	the first six months of the 2017 fiscal year, 100% of the Company’s revenue was from related parties.




	 





	Note
	6 – Notes Payable-Related Parties





	 




	In
	November 2014, January 2015, April 2015 and August 2015, the Company received $20,000, $20,000, $10,000 and $10,000,
	respectively, from the issuance of notes payable that accrue interest at an annual rate of 4%, and are payable on demand.
	During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Company received an additional $28,890, increasing
	the balance on the notes to $93,790 as of September 30, 2016, including the assumption of the stockholder’s note
	mentioned below. The aggregate loan balance as of March 31, 2017 is $93,790.

	FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS






	 





	There
	are statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts. These “forward-looking statements”
	can be identified by use of terminology such as “believe”, “hope”, “may”, “anticipate”,
	“should”, “intend”, “plan”, “will”, “expect”, “estimate”,
	“project”, “positioned”, “strategy”, and similar expressions. Although management believes
	that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly Report are reasonable, they do not guarantee
	our future performance, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore,
	actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.




	 





	OVERVIEW






	 





	Wall
	Street Media Co, Inc. (the “Company” “we” “us” “our”) was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com,
	Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 6, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its name to My Catalogs Online, Inc.
	and in November 2012, changed its name to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. In August 2013, the Company changed
	its name to Wall Street Media Co, Inc., and currently does business under that name.




	 





	CRITICAL
	ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES






	 





	In
	response to the SEC’s financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting
	Policies, the Company has selected its more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology
	used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects
	on the Company’s financial condition. These accounting estimates are discussed below. These estimates involve certain assumptions
	that if incorrect could create a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition






	 





	Revenue
	is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, economic
	risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured, and any future
	obligations of the Company are insignificant.




	 




	The
	Company provides consulting services to various businesses. Services provided are Management Advisory Services. 100% of these
	services were provided to a related party.




	 




	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS




	 





	FOR
	THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016






	 






	Revenue:

	The Company’s revenues increased approximately 240% to $17,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared
	to $5,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to an increase in consulting services provided to related parties.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses:

	The Company’s operating expenses decreased approximately 41% to $17,706 during the three months ended March 31,
	2017 compared to $30,015 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees.




	 





	Net
	Loss from Operations



	: The Company’s net loss from
	operations decreased approximately 97% to $706 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from a net loss from
	operations of $25,015 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The primary reason for this was due to an increase in consulting
	services provided to related parties.

	FOR
	THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016






	 






	Revenue:

	The Company’s revenues increased approximately 55% to $39,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017,
	as compared to $25,200 for the six months ended March 31, 2016 due to an increase in consulting services provided to related
	parties.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses:

	The Company’s operating expenses decreased approximately 21% to $48,948 during the six months ended March 31,
	2017 compared to $62,238 for the six months ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees.




	 





	Net
	Loss from Operations



	: The Company’s net loss
	from operations decreased approximately 73% to $9,948 during the six months ended March 31, 2017 from $37,038 for the
	six months ended March 31, 2016. This was due a decrease in professional fees and an increase in consulting services
	provided to related parties.




	 





	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	 





	Net
	cash provided by operating activities was $744 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $36,818 of net cash used
	in operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in consulting
	service income and a decrease in salaries expense.




	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1,100 in cash. The Company has incurred losses from operations, and such losses
	are expected to continue. The Company’s auditors have included a "Going Concern Qualification" in their report
	for the year ended September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company has a working capital deficit with minimal revenues as of
	March 31, 2017. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
	is actively seeking to combine or merge with another operating company. There can be no assurance that the level of funding needed
	will be acquired or that the Company will generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations for the next twelve months. The unaudited
	condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The “Going
	Concern Qualification” might make it substantially more difficult to raise capital.




	 





	RELATED
	PERSON TRANSACTIONS






	 





	100%
	of the Company's revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were generated by affiliates of the Company's principal
	shareholder.

	ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	 





	For
	information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the unaudited condensed financial statements
	if applicable.





	 






	OFF-BALANCE
	SHEET ARRANGEMENTS






	 





	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources, that is material to investors.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	: An evaluation was conducted by the registrant’s president of the effectiveness
	of the design and operation of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017. Based on that
	evaluation, the Company’s president (who serves as the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
	financial officer) concluded that the registrant’s controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure
	that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the registrant files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
	rules and forms. If the registrant develops new business or engages or hires a chief financial officer or similar financial expert,
	the registrant intends to review its disclosure controls and procedures.




	 




	Management
	is aware that there is a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees dealing with general administrative
	and financial matters.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:

	There was no change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting
	identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a–15 or Rule 15d–15 under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or
	is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

	1.
	I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of Wall Street Media Co, Inc.;




	 




	2.
	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by this report;




	 




	3.
	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
	presented in this report;




	 




	4.
	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined
	in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:




	 




	(a)
	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
	those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 




	(b)
	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 




	(c)
	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and




	 




	(d)
	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
	registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and




	 




	5.
	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors
	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	(a)
	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
	and




	 




	(b)
	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.
