NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the 
      notes issued from Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2016-3 (SDART 
      2016-3):
    

      --$247,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--$374,000,000 class A-2 
      notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$160,290,000 class A-3 notes 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$183,010,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$197,200,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$108,310,000 
      class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$74,700,000 class E notes 
      'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERSDeclining Credit Quality: 2016-3 is backed by 
      collateral relatively consistent with the 2014-2016 pools, with a 
      weighted average (WA) FICO score of 600 and internal WA loss forecast 
      score (LFS) of 555. However, obligors with no FICO scores increased to 
      the highest level to date at 18.6% of the pool. Fitch considers the 
      growing no-FICO originations a negative trend in light of the weaker 
      loss performance observed for these obligors.
    

      Increased Extended-Term Contracts: The concentration of 73-75 month 
      loans increased to 7.9% from 4.7% in 2016-2, and 60+ month loans account 
      for 92.2% of the pool, towards the higher end of the range historically 
      for the platform. Consistent with prior Fitch-rated transactions, an 
      additional stress was applied to the 73-75 month loans when deriving the 
      loss proxy.
    

      Weakening Performance: Although within range of the 2010-2012 
      performance, recent 2013-2015 portfolio and securitization losses are 
      tracking higher. Loss frequency has been driven higher by looser 
      underwriting, while loss severity has risen due to slightly weaker 
      wholesale vehicle values and early-stage defaults on extended term 
      collateral. Fitch expects the 2015-2016 vintages to perform relatively 
      in line with 2013-2014, if not weaker.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 
      49.70% for the class A notes, down slightly from 49.85% in recent 
      transactions. Excess spread is initially 10.55% per annum, consistent 
      with recent transactions.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SC's recent financial results have been weaker 
      due to higher losses on the managed portfolio. However, the company has 
      been profitable since 2007 and Fitch currently rates Santander, SC's 
      majority owner, 'A-'/'F2'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SC demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems SC 
      capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of 
      defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss 
      levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch 
      taking negative rating actions on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Santander 
      Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2016-3 to increased credit losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This 
      shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate 
      bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch 
      was provided with third-party due diligence information from Deloitte 
      and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or 
      recomputing certain information with respect to 150 loans from the 
      statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of this rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Santander Drive Auto 
      Receivables Trust 2016-3 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those 
      of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia

Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Trust Agreement
(2016-3)






Each of the Owner Trustee and the Administrator,
as applicable, is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing
activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Issuer shall engage in any activity
other than in connection with the foregoing or other than as
required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4.  Appointment of
the Owner Trustee.  The Seller hereby appoints the Owner
Trustee as trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof,
to have all the rights, powers and duties set forth
herein.

SECTION 2.5.  Initial
Capital Contribution of Trust Estate .   As of the
date of the Original Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned,
transferred, conveyed and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of
$1. The Owner Trustee hereby acknowledges receipt in trust
from the Seller, as of such date, of the foregoing contribution,
which shall constitute the initial Trust Estate and shall be
deposited in the Collection Account.

SECTION 2.6.  Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will
hold the Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions
set forth herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders,
subject to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction
Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
Issuer constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust
Statute and that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument
of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, solely for United States federal income or state and
local income, franchise and value added tax purposes, so long as
there is a single beneficial owner of the Certificates, the Issuer
will be disregarded as an entity separate from such beneficial
owner and the Notes will be characterized as debt. The parties
agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax
authorities, the Issuer will not file or cause to be filed annual
or other necessary returns, reports and other forms consistent with
the characterization of the Issuer as an entity separate from its
owner. In the event that the Issuer is deemed to have more
than one beneficial owner for United States federal income tax
purposes, the Issuer will file returns, reports and other forms
consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as a partnership
(that is not treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this
Agreement may be amended to include such provisions as may be
required under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee
shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to
the extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust
Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the
Issuer. It is the intention of the parties hereto that except
as expressly stated herein, the affairs of the Trust shall be
managed by the Administrator pursuant to the Administration
Agreement. The Owner Trustee has heretofore filed the
Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust
Statute, such filing hereby being ratified and approved in all
respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Statutory
Trust Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties
hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business trust”
within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay

perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it

obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction
where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect
the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents and the Underwriting Agreement.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by
the Seller of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and
the Underwriting Agreement (i) have been duly authorized by all

regulation, (B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement or instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which
its properties are bound (other than violations of such laws,
rules, regulations, organizational instruments, agreements or
instruments which do not affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of any of such agreements and which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by, or the Seller’s ability to
perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents to which
it is a party or the Underwriting Agreement).

(c) No Consent Required
. No approval, authorization or other action by, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the

approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained and
filings which have previously been made and (ii) approvals,

party and the Underwriting Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable the
rights of creditors of limited liability companies from time to

laws of general application relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings
. There are no actions, orders, suits or proceedings pending

other Transaction Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of
the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would
materially and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents.

Seller’s knowledge, as of the date hereof, no amounts are
required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to FATCA with respect
to payments to be made to the Certificateholders hereunder or under
the Sale and Servicing Agreement. If the Seller has actual
knowledge that withholding tax under FATCA applies with respect to
one or more payments on a Certificate, the Seller will notify the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificate Paying
Agent of such fact.

Delaware (it being understood that the Issuer may have bank

such Certificateholder’s tax returns inconsistent with
Section 2.6 herein and Section 2.14 of the
Indenture.

SECTION 2.12.  Federal

than one beneficial owner for United States federal income tax

of income, gain, loss, credit and deduction for a month shall be
allocated to the Certificateholders as of the first Record Date
following the end of such month in proportion to their Percentage
Interests on such Record Date. The Seller (or the
Administrator in accordance with the Administration Agreement and
Section 5.3 ) is authorized, in its sole discretion,
(i) to modify the allocations in this paragraph if necessary
or appropriate for the allocations to fairly reflect the economic
income, gain or loss to the Certificateholders or otherwise comply
with the requirements of the Code and (ii) to determine whether or
not to make any available tax elections such as an election under
Section 1278 or 754 of the Code.

ARTICLE III

CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF
CERTIFICATES

SECTION 3.1.  Initial
Ownership . Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificates, the Seller shall be the sole
beneficiary of the Issuer, and upon the issuance of the
Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the
Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is a
Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2.  Authorization
of the Certificates . Concurrently with the sale of the
Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, at the direction of the Seller, (a) a single Book-Entry
Certificate shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar
in the name of Cede & Co. or (b) a single Definitive
Certificate shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar
to or upon the written order of the Seller. The Certificate
shall represent 100% of the Percentage Interest in the Issuer and
shall be fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3.  Book-Entry
Certificates .

(a) The Certificate, upon original
issuance, may be issued, substantially in the form of Exhibit
A hereto, representing the Certificate to be delivered to the
Certificate Registrar, as initial agent for the Clearing Agency,
by, or on behalf of, the Issuer. The Book-Entry Certificate
shall be issued in an aggregate nominal principal amount of
$100,000 (which shall be deemed to be the equivalent of 100,000
units), and all beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Certificate
shall be owned, in the minimum principal amount of $5,000 and
integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Issuer shall
not issue any Certificate that would cause the aggregate nominal
principal amount of all Certificates to exceed $100,000, or 100,000
units, without the prior written consent of all
Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents shall be deemed
to reduce the nominal principal amount of any Certificate prior to
payment in full of all Notes; provided , however ,
that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Issuer
pursuant to Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall be deemed to
repay the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in
full; provided , further , that any failure to pay in
full the nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Transaction Documents shall be paid and
allocated to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their
respective Percentage Interests. Unless the Seller directs
otherwise pursuant to Section 3.2 , such Certificates shall
initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of
Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC as the initial

Clearing Agency, and no
Certificateholder will receive a Definitive Certificate
representing such Certificateholder’s interest in such
Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.5 . Unless
and until definitive, fully registered Certificates (the “
Definitive Certificates ”) have been issued to the
applicable Certificateholders pursuant to Section 3.2 or
3.5 :

(i) the provisions of this
Section shall be in full force and effect;

(ii) the Certificate Registrar,
the Certificate Paying Agent, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all
purposes of this Agreement (including the payment of amounts
payable under the Transaction Documents and the giving of
instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole
Certificateholders, and shall have no obligation to the Certificate
Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of
this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate
Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and
shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
or among such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing
Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement,
unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued pursuant to
Section 3.5 , the initial Clearing Agency will make
book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
receive and transmit payments due under the Transaction Documents
with regard to the Certificates to such Clearing Agency
Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement
requires or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified percentage
of the Percentage Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver
instructions to the Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has
received instructions to such effect from Certificate Owners and/or
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing
Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively, such
required percentage of the beneficial interest in the
Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial
interest in a Book-Entry Certificate will not be entitled to have
any portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names
and will not be considered to be the Certificate Owners or
Certificateholders of any Certificates under this Agreement;
and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate will be made to the Clearing Agency, or its nominee, as
the registered owner thereof, and none

of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
a Book-Entry Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership
interests.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part, shall
only be made in accordance with Section 3.3(a) . Subject to
clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 3.3(a) ,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate shall be limited to transfers
of such Book-Entry Certificate in whole, but not in part, to a
nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a successor of the Clearing
Agency or such successor’s nominee.

In the event that a Book-Entry
Certificate is exchanged for one or more Definitive Certificates
pursuant to Section 3.5 , such Certificates may be exchanged
for one another only in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Issuer and the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 3.4.  Notices to
Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication
to the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless
and until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to
Certificate Owners pursuant to Section 3.5 , the Owner
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to the Certificateholders to the Clearing
Agency, and shall have no obligation to the Certificate
Owners.

SECTION 3.5.  Definitive
Certificates .

(a) If (i) the Seller advises the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge
its responsibilities with respect to the Certificates, and the
Seller is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) the Seller
at its option advises the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system
through the Clearing Agency, then the Clearing Agency shall notify
all Certificate Owners and the Certificate Paying Agent of the
occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Certificates representing the Certificates to Certificate Owners
requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Certificate
Registrar of the typewritten Certificate or Certificates
representing the Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency,
accompanied by re-registration instructions, the Owner Trustee
shall execute and the Certificate Registrar shall register,
authenticate and deliver the Definitive Certificates representing
the Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, Certificate Registrar, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any
delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely
on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates
representing the Certificates, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, the Certificate Paying Agent and the Indenture Trustee
shall recognize such Holders of the Definitive Certificates as the
applicable Certificateholders.

(b) Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificates, any Holder
of a Definitive Certificate may transfer all or any portion of the
Percentage Interest (subject to the requirements set forth in
Sections 3.3 and 3.7 ) evidenced by such Certificate
upon surrender thereof to the Certificate Registrar accompanied by
the documents required by this Section 3.5 . Such
transfer may be made by a registered Certificateholder in person or
by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Certificate Registrar accompanied by (a) a
written instrument of transfer in the form of the
“Assignment” attached to the Form of Certificate
attached hereto as Exhibit A and with such signature
guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the
instrument of transfer as the Certificate Registrar may reasonably
require, (b) an executed direction letter regarding registration of
such transfer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C , (c)
unless the transferee is a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller, an
executed Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the form of
Exhibit B (unless the Seller shall have received an opinion
of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that such
transfer without an executed Certificate Investor Representation
Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B will not cause
the Issuer to be treated as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal
income tax purposes and the Seller shall have consented in writing
that no such written representation letter is required) and (d) the
documents required by Section 3.7(c) hereof. Promptly
upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Certificate
Registrar of the transferor’s Certificate, the Certificate
Registrar shall record the name of such transferee as a
Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate
Register and the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate
Registrar shall authenticate and deliver to such Certificateholder,
a Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the
event a transferor transfers only a portion of its Percentage
Interest, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate
Registrar shall register, authenticate and deliver to such
transferor, a new Certificate evidencing such transferor’s
new Percentage Interest and the Owner Trustee shall execute, and
the Certificate Registrar shall register, authenticate
and deliver to such transferee, a new Certificate evidencing
such transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to
each transfer of a beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the
new Certificate or Certificates, the Certificate Registrar shall
cancel and destroy in accordance with its customary practices the
Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the
Indenture Trustee shall treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other
than as required by Section 3.7 or under applicable law),
the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the owner
of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate without
regard to any notice to the contrary.

Definitive Certificates will not be
eligible for clearing or settlement through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream.

SECTION 3.6.  Registration
of the Certificates . Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as an agent of the Issuer, in its capacity as “Certificate
Registrar” (the “ Certificate

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2016-3)






Registrar ”) shall maintain at its Corporate Trust
Office, or at the office of any agent appointed by it and approved
in writing by the Certificateholders at the time of such
appointment, a register (the “ Certificate Register
”) for the registration and transfer of any
Certificate. Prior to the due presentment for registration of
transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar or any agent of the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall
treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered (as of
the applicable Record Date) as the owner of such Certificate for
the purpose of receiving distributions on such Certificate and for
all other purposes whatsoever without regard to any notice to the
contrary (other than as required by Section 3.7 or under
applicable law). For the avoidance of doubt, a Certificate is
not negotiable, and the records maintained by the Certificate
Registrar in the Certificate Register with respect to each
Certificate and its related registered owner are intended to cause
the Certificates to be issued in registered form, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and shall
record (a) the Percentage Interest evidenced by each Certificate
and (b) all distributions made to each Certificateholder with
respect to the Issuer’s assets. The entries in the
Certificate Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

SECTION 3.7.  Transfer of
the Certificates .

(a) A Certificateholder may assign,
convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate, subject to the restrictions
set forth in Section 3.5 and this Section 3.7
. Each purchaser and transferee (other than a U.S. Affiliate
of the Seller) of a Certificate will be required to provide a
Certificate Investor Representation Letter substantially in the
form of Exhibit B to the Certificate Registrar upon which it
may conclusively rely (unless the Seller shall have received an
opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that
such transfer without an executed Certificate Investor
Representation Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes and the Seller shall have
consented in writing that no such written representation letter is
required).

By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder thereof (and, if
the holder is a Plan, its fiduciary) shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the
Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of or with any
assets of, a Benefit Plan or Plan that is subject to Similar
Law. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein and
in the Certificate, each Certificateholder may transfer all or any
portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate
upon delivery to the Certificate Registrar of the documents
required by Section 3.5 and this Section 3.7 and, in
the case of a Definitive Certificate, surrender of such Definitive
Certificate to the Certificate Registrar. Such transfer may be
made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney
duly authorized in writing upon (i) in the case of a Definitive
Certificate, surrender of such Certificate to the Certificate
Registrar accompanied by (x) a written instrument of transfer in

direction letter regarding
registration of such transfer in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C , (ii) unless the transferee is a U.S. corporate
Affiliate of the Seller (or disregarded entity thereof), an
executed Certificate Investor Representation Letter substantially
in the form of Exhibit B (unless the Seller shall have
received an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the
effect that such transfer without an executed Certificate Investor
Representation Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes and the Seller shall have
consented in writing that no such written representation letter is
required) and (iii) the documents required by clause (c)
hereof. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and, in
the case of a Definitive Certificate, receipt by the Certificate
Registrar of the transferor’s Certificate, the Certificate
Registrar shall record the name of such transferee as a
Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate
Register and, in the case of a Definitive Certificate, the Owner
Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver, to such Certificateholder a Certificate
evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the event a transferor
transfers only a portion of its Percentage Interest, the Owner
Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate Registrar shall
register, authenticate and deliver to such transferor, a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of a
new Definitive Certificate or Definitive Certificates, the
Certificate Registrar shall cancel and destroy the Definitive
Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. Unless otherwise provided under applicable law, the
Owner Trustee, the Certificate Register and the Indenture Trustee
shall treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered
as the sole owner of the beneficial interest in the Issuer
evidenced by such Certificate, without regard to any notice to the
contrary.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.7 , the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental
charges required to be paid in connection with such
transfer.

(c) By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), each transferee of a
Certificate (other than a U.S. corporate Affiliate of the Seller,
or disregarded entity thereof) shall be deemed to have
acknowledged, represented and agreed as follows:

(1) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) has neither acquired nor
will it transfer any Certificate it purchases (or any interest
therein) or cause any such Certificate (or any interest therein) to
be marketed on or through an “established securities
market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code,
including, without limitation, an over-the-counter market or an
interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy
or sell quotations.

(2) Unless the Seller has received
an opinion from a nationally recognized tax counsel (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may rely on reasonable representations of the
applicable transferee or other applicable persons) that the
proposed

transfer, without the representation
pursuant to this paragraph, will not cause the Issuer to be treated
as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a
corporation for United States federal income tax purposes and the
Seller has consented to such transfer in writing, it (and any
Person for which it holds Certificates as agent or nominee,
collectively for purposes of this paragraph (2), a
“transferee”) either (A) is not, and will not become, a
partnership, Subchapter S corporation or grantor trust for United
States federal income tax purposes (or a disregarded entity the
single owner of which is any of the foregoing) or (B) is such an
entity, but (x) no more than 50% of the value of any of the direct
or indirect beneficial interests in such transferee (or in the case
of a disregarded entity, the interests of its single owner) is or
will be attributable to such transferee’s (or in the case of
a disregarded entity, the single owner’s) interest in
Restricted Notes and the Certificates and (y) it is not and will
not be a principal purpose of the arrangement involving such
entity’s beneficial interest in any Restricted Notes or
Certificates to permit any partnership to satisfy the 100 partner
limitation of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii)
necessary for such partnership not to be classified as a publicly
traded partnership under the Code.

(3) It understands that if it is
acquiring any Certificate for the account of one or more Persons as
agent or nominee, (A) it shall provide to the Certificate
Registrar, the Indenture Trustee and the Seller information as to
the number of such Persons and any changes in the number of such
Persons and (B) any such change in the number of Persons for whose
account a Certificate is held shall require the written consent of
the Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, which consent shall be
granted unless the Seller determines that such proposed change in
number of Persons would create a risk that the Issuer would be
classified for United States federal or any applicable state tax
purposes as an association (or a publicly traded partnership)
taxable as a corporation.

(4) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) understands that no
subsequent transfer of the Certificates (or any interest therein)
is permitted unless (A) such transfer is of a Certificate with a
Percentage Interest of more than 5% (or of an interest in a
Certificate representing a Percentage Interest of more than 5%) and
(B) the Seller, on behalf of the Issuer, consents in writing to the
proposed transfer, which consent shall be granted unless the Seller
determines that such transfer would either create a risk that the
Issuer would be classified for United States federal or any
applicable state tax purposes as an association (or a publicly
traded partnership) taxable as a corporation (e.g., the transfer
could cause the aggregate number of beneficial owners of Restricted
Notes, the Certificates (or interests therein) and any instrument
with respect to which there has not been rendered an opinion that
it will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax
purposes, issued by an entity 50% or more of the value of which is
or will be attributable to direct or indirect interests in the
Issuer, to exceed 95).

(5) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate is
a “United States person” (as defined in Code section
7701(a)(30)) and shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator, the Indenture

by the Administrator, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificate Paying
Agent or the Owner Trustee to determine, in its sole discretion,
that payments on such Certificates will not be subject to
withholding under U.S. tax law.

(6) Prior to December 31, 2017 or
such later date that the Amended Partnership Audit Rules shall
apply to the Issuer, (A) it shall provide to the Administrator on
behalf of the Issuer and the Depositor any further information
required by the Issuer to comply with the Amended Partnership Audit
Rules, including Section 6226(a) of the Amended Partnership Audit
Rules and (B) if it is not the beneficial owner of a Certificate,
such beneficial owner shall provide to the Administrator on behalf
of the Issuer and the Depositor any further information required by
the Issuer to comply with the Amended Partnership Audit Rules,
including Section 6226(a) of the Amended Partnership Audit Rules
and, to the extent the Issuer determines such appointment necessary
for it to make an election under Section 6226(a) of the Amended
Partnership Audit Rules, hereby appoints the transferee as its
agent for purposes of receiving any notifications or information
pursuant to the notice requirements under Section 6226(a)(2) of the
Amended Partnership Audit Rules.

(7) Unless the Seller has received
an opinion from a nationally recognized tax counsel (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may rely on reasonable representations of the
applicable transferee or other applicable persons) that the
proposed transfer or the type of transfer described by this
paragraph, without the representation pursuant to this paragraph,
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes, it (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) will not (i) beneficially
own 80% or more of the Certificates (or interest therein) at any
time that (A) a member of an expanded group (as defined in Proposed
Treasury Regulation section 1.385-1(b)(3) or any successor
regulation then in effect) that includes such holder (or a person
considered to be the same person as the holder for United States
federal income tax purposes), (B) a “controlled
partnership” (as defined in proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.385-1(b)(1)) of such expanded group or (C) a disregarded
entity owned directly or indirectly by a person described in
preceding clause (A) or (B) beneficially owns any Note or (ii)
beneficially own 80% or more of the Certificates and Restricted
Notes, taken together, at any time that (A) a member of an expanded
group (as defined in Proposed Treasury Regulation section
1.385-1(b)(3) or any successor regulation then in effect) that
includes such holder (or a person considered to be the same person
as the holder for United States federal income tax purposes), (B) a
“controlled partnership” (as defined in proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.385-1(b)(1)) of such expanded group
or (C) a disregarded entity owned directly or indirectly by a
person described in preceding clause (A) or (B) beneficially owns
any Note other than a Restricted Note.

(8) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) understands that any
attempted transfer that contravenes any provisions of Section
3.5(b) , Section 3.7(c) or Section 3.7(h) shall
be a void transfer ab initio .

(f) If (1) a transfer or attempted

Section 3.7 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee, (2) a
transferee of a Certificate failed to deliver to the Certificate
Registrar a Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the form
of Exhibit B hereto or (3) the Certificateholder of any
Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any Certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Certificate Registrar, upon actual knowledge of such circumstances,
will not register such attempted or purported transfer and, if a
transfer has been registered, such transfer shall be absolutely
null and void ab initio and shall not operate to transfer
any rights to the purported transferee (such purported transferee,
a “ Disqualified Transferee ”) and the last
preceding Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that was not

Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) If (i) any mutilated Certificate
is surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or (ii) the
Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction that
any Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof

with such security or indemnity as may be requested by the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificate Registrar to
save them harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the
Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, a new
Certificate for the same Percentage Interest as the Certificate so
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a
different issue number, with such notations, if any, as the
Certificate Registrar shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 3.7 , the Issuer, the

other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with

issued pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall constitute
complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as
if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate shall be found at any time.

(h) No transfer of the Certificates
(or any interest therein) is permitted unless (1) such transfer is
of a Certificate with a Percentage Interest of more than 5% (or of
an interest in a Certificate representing a Percentage Interest of
more than 5%) and (2) the Seller, on behalf of the Issuer, consents
in writing to the proposed transfer, which consent shall be granted
unless the Seller determines that such transfer would either create
a risk that the Issuer would be classified for United States
federal or any applicable state tax purposes as an association (or
a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation (e.g., the
transfer could cause the aggregate number of beneficial owners of
Restricted Notes, the Certificates (or interests therein) and any
instrument with respect to which there has not been rendered an
opinion that it will be treated as debt for United States federal
income tax purposes, issued by an entity 50% or more of the value
of which is or will be attributable to direct or indirect interests

Certificates have been issued, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate Paying
Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the
Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Issuer may revoke such power
and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Issuer determines in
its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and any co-paying agent
chosen by the Certificate Paying Agent. Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying
Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Owner
Trustee. If Wells Fargo Bank, National Association shall no longer
be the Certificate Paying Agent, the Issuer shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or trust company). The Issuer shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Issuer to execute and deliver an instrument in
which such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer that as
Certificate Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent
or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any,
held by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums
shall be paid to such Certificateholders. If a successor
Certificate Paying Agent does not take office within 30 days after
the retiring Certificate Paying Agent resigns or is removed, the
retiring Certificate Paying Agent, the Administrator and the
Seller, acting jointly, or the Majority Certificateholders may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of
a successor Certificate Paying Agent (with all costs, fees and
expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred by
the Indenture Trustee, in its capacity as Certificate Paying Agent,
in connection with such petition to be paid by the Issuer). The

outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where

exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in
respect of the Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The
Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of
the Certificate Registrar for the purposes of surrendering
Certificates for registration or exchange of Certificates, and the
Corporate Trust Office of the Owner Trustee for all other purposes.
The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the
Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee of
the location, and of any change in the location, of any such office
or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any
such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
applicable Corporate Trust Office of the Owner Trustee, and the
Issuer hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as its agent to receive
all such surrenders, notices and demands.

SECTION 3.10. Relevant
Trustee . Following the payment in full of principal of, and
interest on, the Notes and receipt of written notification from the
Servicer, the Certificate Paying Agent shall assume the role of
Relevant Trustee and shall perform the express obligations of the
Relevant Trustee under the Sale and Servicing Agreement. All of the
same rights, protections, indemnities and immunities of Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association hereunder (individually and as
Certificate Paying Agent) shall be equally applicable to Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association in its role as Relevant Trustee
under the Transaction Documents.

SECTION 3.11. Statement to
Certificateholders . To the extent the Certificate Paying Agent
has assumed the role of Relevant Trustee pursuant to the terms of
Section 3.10 ;

(a) The Certificate Paying Agent may
make all reports or notices required to be provided by the Relevant

have no duty or obligations to review, verify or confirm the

with the consent of the Certificateholders, shall consider the
interests of the Noteholders in addition to the interests of the
Issuer and whether the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner Trustee
shall have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy
Event by the Issuer if the Owner Trustee shall not have been
furnished (at the expense of the Person that requested such letter
be furnished to the Owner Trustee) a letter from an independent
accounting firm of national reputation stating that in the opinion
of such firm the Issuer is then insolvent. The Owner Trustee
shall not be personally liable to any Noteholder or
Certificateholder on account of the Owner Trustee’s good
faith reliance on the provisions of this Section 4.3
and no Noteholder or Certificateholder shall have any claim for
breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise against the Owner Trustee for
giving or withholding its consent to any such Bankruptcy
Event.

(b) The parties hereto stipulate and
agree that no Certificateholder has the power to commence any
Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Issuer.

SECTION 4.4.  Restrictions
on Certificateholders’ Power . The
Certificateholders shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be
contrary to any obligation of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or would be
contrary to Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee be
obligated to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5.  Acts of
Certificateholders; Majority Control .

(a) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by
Certificateholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Certificateholders in person or by agents duly appointed in
writing; and

Trust Agreement
(2016-3)







except as herein otherwise expressly
provided such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Owner Trustee, and, where it is
hereby expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby)
are herein sometimes referred to as the “Act” of the
Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any
such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement
and (subject to Article VI ) conclusive in favor of the
Owner Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in
this Section 4.5 .

(b) The fact and date of the
execution by any person of any such instrument or writing may be
proved in any manner that the Owner Trustee deems
sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Certificates
shall be proved by the Certificate Register.

(d) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
by any Certificateholder shall bind the Holder of every Certificate
issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange therefor or in
lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to
be done by the Owner Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such
Certificate.

(e) Except as otherwise provided
herein, to the extent that there is more than one
Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or
instructions which may be given by the Certificateholders under
this Agreement may be taken by the Majority Certificateholders at
the time of such action. With respect to Section 9.24(a)
of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Owner Trustee may act
pursuant to instruction as contemplated therein.

ARTICLE V

CERTAIN DUTIES

SECTION 5.1.  Application of
Trust Funds . Deposits into the Certificate Distribution
Account shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement and this

Certificates have been issued, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
withdraw from the Certificate Distribution Account and distribute
to the Certificateholders, pro rata based on the Percentage
Interest of each Certificateholder, all funds received in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and this
Agreement. Subject to the lien of the Indenture and
Section 5.5 of this Agreement, the Certificate Paying
Agent shall promptly distribute to the Certificateholders all other
amounts (if any) received by the Certificate Paying Agent on behalf
of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata based on the
Percentage Interest of each such Certificateholder). After the
termination of the Indenture in accordance with its terms, the
Certificate Paying Agent, in accordance with the written direction
of the Administrator pursuant to Section 9.1(a) , shall
distribute all amounts received (if any) by the Issuer, the
Certificate Paying Agent and the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Trust Estate to or at the direction of the Certificateholders

(2016-3)







SECTION 5.2.  Method of
Payment . Subject to the Indenture and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, distributions required to be made to the
Certificateholders on any Payment Date and all amounts received by
the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee on any other
date that are payable to the Certificateholders pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be made to the
Certificateholders by wire transfer, in immediately available
funds, to the account of each Certificateholder designated by the
Certificateholder to the Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee in
writing.

SECTION 5.3.  Reports by
Owner Trustee to Certificateholders .

(a) The Administrator shall prepare,
or, at the request and expense of the Administrator, the Owner
Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and the
Administrator shall sign on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder or the Owner Trustee to sign such
documents.

(b) The Administrator shall prepare
and deliver, or, at the request of the Administrator, the
Certificate Paying Agent shall deliver (or cause to be delivered)
to each Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and
applicable Treasury Regulations, such information as may be
required (including Schedule K-1, if applicable) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its United States federal and state
income tax returns.

(c) As long as the Issuer is treated
as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes and
the Seller or a U.S. Affiliate is a beneficial owner of a
Certificate, to the extent allowed by the Code, the Seller or such
U.S. Affiliate shall be designated the “tax matters
partner” of the Trust pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. If neither the Seller nor
an Affiliate of the Seller is a beneficial owner of a Certificate,
then the Certificateholder with the largest Percentage Interest
shall be designated the “tax matters partner” of the
Issuer pursuant to Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations.

(d) In the event that the Issuer is
classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes, as of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017,
or if later, the date that the Amended Partnership Audit Rules
apply to the Issuer, the Depositor (or a U.S. affiliate of the
Depositor if the Depositor is ineligible) is hereby designated as
the partnership representative under Section 6223(a) of the Amended
Partnership Audit Rules to the extent allowed under the law. The
Issuer shall (or the Depositor shall cause the Issuer to, or the
Depositor shall instruct the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer
to), to the extent eligible, make the election under Section
6221(b) of the Amended Partnership Audit Rules with respect to
determinations of adjustments at the partnership level and take any
other action such as disclosures and notifications necessary to
effectuate such election. If the election described in the
preceding sentence is not available, to the extent applicable, the
Issuer shall (or the Depositor shall cause the Issuer to, or the
Depositor shall instruct the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer
to) make the election under Section 6226(a) of the Amended
Partnership Audit Rules with respect to the alternative to payment
of imputed underpayment by partnership and take
 












 



22


 


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2016-3)







any other action such as filings,
disclosures and notifications necessary to effectuate such
election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, Depositor and
Administrator are each authorized, in its sole discretion, to make
any available election related to Sections 6221 through 6241 of the
Amended Partnership Audit Rules and take any action it deems
necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of the
Code and conduct the Issuer’s affairs under Sections 6221
through 6241 of the Amended Partnership Audit Rules. Each
Certificateholder and, if different, each beneficial owner of a
Certificate shall promptly provide the Issuer, Depositor and
Administrator any requested information, documentation or material
to enable the Issuer to make any of the elections described in this
clause (c) and otherwise comply with Sections 6221 through 6241 of
the Amended Partnership Audit Rules. Each Certificate Owner
and, if different, each beneficial owner of a Certificate shall
hold the Issuer and its affiliates harmless for any losses (i)
resulting from a beneficial owner of a Certificate not properly
taking into account or paying its allocated adjustment or liability
under Section 6226 of the Amended Partnership Audit Rules and (ii)
it may suffer due to actions it takes with respect to and to comply
with the rules under Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Amended
Partnership Audit Rules.

SECTION 5.4.  Certificate
Distribution Account.  The Certificate Distribution
Account shall be established as a non-interest bearing trust
account pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. Funds on deposit in the Certificate Distribution
Account shall be held uninvested. The Certificateholders shall
possess all beneficial right, title and interest in and to all
funds on deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution
Account and all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided
herein, in the Indenture or in the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole
dominion and control of the Certificate Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time, the
Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Account,
the Servicer on behalf of the Issuer, shall, within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period) after becoming aware of the
fact, establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an
Eligible Account and shall direct the Certificate Paying Agent to
transfer any cash then on deposit in the Certificate Distribution
Account to such new Certificate Distribution Account.

SECTION 5.5. 
Withholding .

(a) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Issuer’s payment, distribution or allocation
of income to a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount
otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with
this Section 5.5 ; provided that the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent shall not have an
obligation to withhold any such amount if and for so long as the
Seller or a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or
the Certificate Paying Agent is hereby authorized and directed to
retain from amounts otherwise distributable to the
Certificateholders sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that
is legally owed by the Issuer (but such authorization shall not
prevent the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate
Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate
proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of
any
 












 



23


 


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2016-3)







withholding tax imposed with respect
to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such
Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Issuer and
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a
payment, distribution or allocation of income, the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent may in its
sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this
Section 5.5 .

(b) With respect to any and all
payments to a Certificateholder, (i) the Certificateholder will
provide to the applicable withholding agent (including the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent),
any documentation or certification required or reasonably
appropriate for the such withholding agent to satisfy its
obligations with respect to FATCA, if any, and to determine whether
any withholding tax may be required to be withheld pursuant to
FATCA; and (ii) the Certificateholder acknowledges and agrees that
the applicable withholding agent (including, if applicable, the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying
Agent) shall have the right to deduct and withhold any required
U.S. withholding tax, including any withholding tax pursuant to
FATCA, on any amounts payable with respect to the Certificates
(without any corresponding gross-up or other indemnification) if
any such Certificateholder or beneficial owner either is subject to
withholding under FATCA, fails to comply with the documentation
requirements in clause (i) , or otherwise fails to establish
a complete exemption from such withholding tax to the reasonable
satisfaction of the applicable withholding agent (including, if
applicable, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying
Agent).

SECTION 5.6.  Preservation
of Information; Communications to Certificateholders
.

(a) The Certificate Registrar shall
preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the
names and addresses of Certificateholders received in its capacity
as the Certificate Registrar and provide a copy thereof to the
Owner Trustee and Certificate Paying Agent; provided, however, that
so long as the Certificate Paying Agent is the Certificate
Registrar, no list separate from the Certificate Register shall be
required to be provided to the Certificate Paying Agent.

(b) The Certificateholders may
communicate with other Certificateholders with respect to their
rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates. Upon
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of any written request by
three or more Certificateholders or by one or more
Certificateholders holding in the aggregate more than 25% of the
Percentage Interests to receive a copy of the most current list of
Certificateholders together with a copy of the communication that
the applicant proposes to send, the Certificate Registrar shall, at
the expense of the Issuer, distribute such list to the requesting
Certificateholders; provided, that the Certificate Registrar may
elect not to afford the requesting Certificateholders access to the
list of Certificateholders if it agrees to mail the desired
communication or proxy, on behalf of and at the expense of the
requesting Certificateholders, to all
Certificateholders.

(c) The Certificate Registrar shall
promptly give notice to each Certificateholder of any change in the
Indenture Trustee’s website pursuant to which the statement
pursuant to Section 4.6 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement
is made available of which it has been provided notice pursuant to
Section 4.6 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

SECTION 5.7.  Rule 144A
Information . At any time when the Issuer is not subject
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and is not exempt from
reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, upon
the request of a Certificateholder, the Seller shall promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished Rule 144A Information to such
Certificateholder, to a prospective purchaser of such Certificate
designated by such Certificateholder or to the Certificate
Registrar for delivery to such Certificateholder or a prospective
purchaser designated by such Certificateholder in order to permit
compliance by such Certificateholder with Rule 144A in connection
with the resale of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

However, obligors with no FICO scores increased to the highest level to date at 18.6% of the pool. Fitch considers the growing no-FICO originations a negative trend in light of the weaker loss performance observed for these obligors.Increased Extended-Term Contracts: The concentration of 73-75 month loans increased to 7.9% from 4.7% in 2016-2, and 60+ month loans account for 92.2% of the pool, towards the higher end of the range historically for the platform. Consistent with prior Fitch-rated transactions, an additional stress was applied to the 73-75 month loans when deriving the loss proxy.Weakening Performance: Although within range of the 2010-2012 performance, recent 2013-2015 portfolio and securitization losses are tracking higher. Loss frequency has been driven higher by looser underwriting, while loss severity has risen due to slightly weaker wholesale vehicle values and early-stage defaults on extended term collateral. Fitch expects the 2015-2016 vintages to perform relatively in line with 2013-2014, if not weaker.Sufficient Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a sequential pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 49.70% for the class A notes, down slightly from 49.85% in recent transactions. Excess spread is initially 10.55% per annum, consistent with recent transactions.Stable Corporate Health: SC's recent financial results have been weaker due to higher losses on the managed portfolio. However, the company has been profitable since 2007 and Fitch currently rates Santander, SC's majority owner, 'A-'/'F2'/Outlook Stable.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems SC capable to service this series.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2016-3 to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Deloitte and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 150 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of this rating action commentary.Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2016-3 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.Read MoreKey Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the link.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchSantander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2016-3 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886593Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013024ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013024&flm_nm=15e_1013024_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013024Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
