WELCOME





CaroGen Corporation is an emerging vaccine immunotherapy company employing a virus-like vesicle (VLV) platform technology developed at Yale University School of Medicine and exclusively licensed for the development and commercialization of vaccine immunotherapies worldwide.
 
Our vision is to create different, potentially transformative first-in-class nanoparticle therapeutic vaccine immunotherapies designed to engage the body’s immune system to both recognize and fight off infectious diseases and cancer.  The company is leveraging the VLV platform and developing a portfolio of vaccine candidates against the following infections/diseases:
 

Chronic Hepatitis B Viral Infection (CHB) in collaboration with Yale School of Medicine and Albany Medical College
Clostridium difficile, a bacterial infection, in collaboration with the University of Connecticut Medical School/Health Center
Zika Virus Infection in collaboration with the Center for Excellence for Vaccine Research (CEVR) at the University of Connecticut

 
The hepatitis B program is CaroGen's lead program and has completed initial proof-of-concept testing in animals which was published in August 2015 in the Journal of Virology.  Worldwide, approximately 240 million people live with CHB and 600,000 die each year from HBV-associated liver disease and cancer.  The HBV program is undergoing optimization for selection of a clinical candidate capable of stimulating the immune system to multiple HBV target antigens.
 
Clostridium difficile is a microbial infection that causes severe diarrhea and is a CDC urgent threat due to antimicrobial resistance.  It is currently estimated that there are 500,000 infections per year in the US resulting 29,000 deaths/year.   There are currently no vaccines for either the prevention or treatment of C. difficile and limited antimicrobial drugs available to treat established infections
 
Zika is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that has been linked to the the development of microcephaly (abnormal smallness of the head usually associated with mental defects) of babies born form mothers infected with the Zika virus and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  As of May 5, 2016, WHO surveillance data / reporting has Zika virus currently circulating in 44 countries with no previous evidence of circulation, and with ongoing transmission by mosquitoes.

TECHNOLOGY





The Company’s vaccine platform is a proprietary replication-competent, virus-like vesicle (VLV) technology pioneered by Dr. John Rose of Yale University School of Medicine. The VLV technology is a hybrid combination of components from two unrelated animal viruses: the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).
 
The VLVs generated are capable of entering into cells of the vaccinated subject where they harmlessly propagate to produce the vaccine antigens to be presented to the host immune system.  Unlike other viral-based vector vaccines, human infection with these viruses (i.e. SFV and VSV) is rare, so the general population is free of pre-existing, virus-neutralizing antibodies that could compromise vaccine efficacy.
 
VLV-based nanoparticle vaccines possess the attributes that may comprise a far superior product, that is, offer more effective protection and long-lasting immunity against chronic infections than that seen with the current vaccine technologies.  The immune response induced by VLV vaccines has the potential to improve efficacy in individuals known to have less than robust immune responses, notably, children, the elderly and the immune-compromised.





Figure 1: Diagram of the hybrid Alphavirus-Rhabdovirus vector: Semliki Forest virus-vesicular stomatitis virus (SFV-VSV), SFV vector containing the sequence of the gene coding for VSV glycoprotein (G) downstream of subgenomic RNA promoter,  sgPr (indicated by curved arrow). Upon infection of a cell with SFV-VSV, G protein will be expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported through Golgi to the plasma membrane. Unspecific interactions between the G cytoplasmic domain and SFV-VSV RNA leads to the release of “vesicles” or virus-like vesicles (VLVs) able to transfer vector RNA to new cells.

UCONN Health Researchers Collaborate with CaroGen Corporation to Develop Vaccine to Treat Colon Cancer
 
November 8, 2016, Farmington, CT -- The University of Connecticut and CaroGen Corporation, an emerging immunotherapy company, today announced a collaboration aimed at developing a therapeutic vaccine for treatment of patients with colon cancer.  CaroGen’s proprietary technology platform will be applied to a specific target studied by UConn Health’s Dr. Kepeng Wang Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Immunology. CaroGen will support this effort with a $70,000 grant to Dr. Wang, and his collaborator Dr. Anthony T. Vella, Ph.D., Professor and Boehringer Ingelheim Chair in Immunology, who will aid in the development of this platform.
 
Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined. It is expected to cause over 49,000 deaths during 2016. The percentage of colon and rectal cancer deaths is highest among people aged 75-84, and colon cancer death rates increase with age.
 
“While the death rate from colon cancer has been dropping in both men and women for several decades thanks to screening and improved treatment, our goal is to reach close to a 100 percent survival rate. By combining our platform with Dr. Wang’s very promising target, we hope that a new powerful immunotherapy will be developed to provide patients with that assurance,” said CaroGen’s President and CEO, Dr. Bijan Almassian.

Rocky Hill, CT - August 20, 2013 – Connecticut Innovations (CI), the state’s quasi-public authority responsible for growing Connecticut businesses through innovative financing and strategic assistance, today announced that it has committed funding totaling $800,000 through its Pre-Seed Fund to five startup ventures focused on innovations in biotechnology, clean tech and information technology:
 
• CaroGen Corporation (Hamden) $150,000 funding commitment
 
• CMB Exchange LLC
 
• dba American Oil Solutions (Bridgeport) $150,000 funding commitment
 
• Engineered Carbon Solutions Inc. (Norwich) $150,000 funding commitment
 
• ImStem Biotechnology Inc. (Farmington) $150,000 funding commitment
 
• ReadyDock Inc. (West Hartford) $200,000 follow-on funding commitment
 
“CI’s Pre-Seed Fund continues to make its mark on emerging, technology-based companies in all parts of the state,” said Claire Leonardi, chief executive officer of CI. “With these five companies, we have now supported and advised a total of 43 technology ventures through the fund. Building a strong technology community in Connecticut by nurturing innovative companies like these is a high priority of the Malloy administration.”
 
CaroGen Corporation is an emerging biotechnology company with a new platform technology for generating potent and safe vaccines. The company’s platform is based on replication-proficient, virus-like vesicles (rVLVs) that allow target antigens to accumulate in high levels in cells, thereby amplifying specific immune responses and creating more potent immune therapies. CaroGen, which has licensed its core technology from Yale University, will focus initially on a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B infections, which can cause chronic liver disease and put patients at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
 
“CaroGen’s work on developing vaccines is not only important from a public health standpoint, but is part of a growing biotech industry that is creating well-paying, high-tech jobs throughout Connecticut,” said Speaker of the House Brendan Sharkey (D-Hamden). “CaroGen is an important member of our local business community, and I am glad we can help them continue to grow right here in Hamden.”
 
American Oil Solutions (AOS) is an emerging clean tech company that has developed an advanced, closed-loop, pollution-free pyrolysis and post-processing system to turn used tires into high-value products. When tires are pyrolyzed, they are heated in an oxygen-free environment to generate gas, oil, scrap steel and carbon char. The gas is recycled and used to feed the energy needs of the pyrolysis. The oil (for heating and fuel), scrap steel and carbon char can be sold to commodity dealers. AOS’s technology focuses on the post-processing steps and helps to maximize the value of the marketable pyrolysis end products.
 
Engineered Carbon Solutions Inc. (ECS) is an emerging clean tech company that has developed a hybrid fuel from recycled materials. This fuel serves as a cost-effective substitute for existing wood pellets as an alternative heating fuel. The company’s Frog City Fuel brand pellets, made from recycled paper, waste coal and biodiesel, are compatible with existing home heating pellet stoves and boilers and provide the same BTU content as premium wood pellets at a lower cost, delivering heat to households at a fraction of the cost of home heating oil.
 
“I am thrilled that Engineered Carbon Solutions Inc. of Norwich is the recipient of Pre-Seed Fund assistance,” remarked State Representative Emmett Riley (D – Norwich). “This company is an asset to the area and a benefit to Connecticut as it continues to explore and develop alternative fuel sources.”
 
ImStem Biotechnology Inc. is an emerging biotechnology company developing cell therapeutic products derived from human embryonic stem cells for use in tissue repair and treatment of neural, heart, vascular and blood system and autoimmune diseases. ImStem is currently focused on developing a cell therapy product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases. The company’s core technology, licensed from the University of Connecticut Health Center, revolves around a unique method to derive mesenchymal stem cells with high efficiency.
 
ReadyDock Inc. is a developer of modular technology for secure storage, charging and disinfecting of computer tablet devices. Its technology is useful in hospitals, laboratories and anywhere bacterial infection is a risk. A main driver of the need for ReadyDock’s technology is hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). HAIs can have a significant adverse financial impact on hospitals, making disinfection technology such as that provided by ReadyDock an attractive solution. In addition to receiving this follow-on investment commitment of $200,000 from CI, ReadyDock received an investment of $150,000 through CI’s Pre-Seed Fund in 2012.
 
CI’s Pre-Seed Fund is an important catalyst in the state’s high-tech economic development engine. It supports the formation of new Connecticut technology companies by providing funding, mentoring and access to business and technical resources.

ABOUT US





CaroGen Corporation is an emerging vaccine company with a platform technology developed by Professor John Rose at Yale University School of Medicine. We are dedicated to the creation and development of virus-like-vesicle (VLV)-based nanoparticle vaccines to address a broad range of infectious and chronic diseases. The company is developing a portfolio of vaccine candidates with a lead program targeting chronic hepatitis B viral infection.
 
The VLV technology represents a significant improvement over existing vaccine technologies:
 
• Capable of robust immune responses with no adjuvant required
• Delivery of multiple vaccine antigens (multi-valent) from a single vaccine – simpler manufacturing and lower cost of goods
• No pre-existing immunity
• No special delivery devices required
• Safety – hybrid virus components used are not capable of reverting to a wild-type virus.
 
Vaccines based on live viruses have been safely used to eradicate smallpox and nearly eradicate polio virus. CaroGen will apply the live virus advantage to secure a leading share of the rapidly growing $30+ billion global human vaccine market.
 
Our vision is to control the spread of infectious diseases and to treat chronic maladies by using a unique single-use manufacturing system that allows for the rapid mass production of recombinant VLV nanoparticle vaccines.
 
Our world-class scientific team and highly experienced management team with deep vaccine experience are bringing the VLV technology to forefront to tackle important human pathogens and disease.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
