He attended Georgia Tech, received his business degree from Georgia State University, and an MBA from American Intercontinental University (AIU). In his youth, Ben was a member of the Atlanta Boy Choir under the direction of Fletcher Wolfe, performing in places such as Paris, France and Manchester, England. He also served as a legislative page for Georgia Senator Jim Tysinger. Ben married Sharon Houston in 1983, which produced three children; Lauren, Ashley and Benjamin III. Ben spent a majority of his professional career in Business Consulting, with large projects in Georgia and Mississippi. Before his illness, he held a position with ADT. Ben is survived by his parents Benjamin, Sr. and Dr. Delores Bailey Gibson; three children, Lauren, Benjamin III, and Ashley (James); brothers Michael and Philip (Betiel) Gibson; three grandchildren; Laila, Ian, and Parker, along with a host of other relatives and close friends. A memorial celebration Mass will be held on Thursday, July 27, at 10:30 am at the Cathedral of Christ the King Catholic Church, 2699 Peachtree Rd. N.E. Atlanta, Ga. 30305.

Ben also handles workers' compensation claims. This area of law applies when an individual is injured while at their workplace. A workers' compensation claim is different than a car accident in that the person is limited in what they may receive, but you are entitled to compensation so let Ben fight for it. Whether your workers' compensation is on land or you are a longshoreman or other maritime worker, he can make receiving your compensation an easy process for you.Criminal LawInternet CrimesCriminal DefenseHe uses extensive experience to successfully negotiate criminal defense representing clients throughout South Louisiana.
