Good day, and welcome to the Cincinnati Bell First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'll like to turn the call over to Josh Duckworth. Please go ahead.
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
Thank you, and good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to Cincinnati Bell's first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is our Chief Executive Officer, Ted Torbeck; and our Chief Financial Officer, Leigh Fox. Ted's comments will provide an update on our strategic initiatives and Leigh will provide a financial overview and discuss our quarterly segment results. Following Leigh's discussion, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session.
Before we proceed, let me remind you that our earnings release and financial statements are posted on our Investor Relations website. In addition, you will also find presentation slides for today's call, which we hope you will find helpful in your analysis. Today's call is being recorded if you would like to listen to it at a future time.
Now, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement presented on slide three. In our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those indicated or suggested by any such forward-looking statements.
More information on potential risks and uncertainties is available in the company's recent filings with the SEC, including Cincinnati Bell's Annual Form 10-K report, Quarterly Form 10-Q reports, and Form 8-K reports. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.
With that, I am pleased to introduce Cincinnati Bell's Chief Executive Officer, Ted Torbeck.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Josh, and good morning – or good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We were off to another great start this year. With each passing quarter, we are rapidly progressing towards our goal of transforming Cincinnati Bell into a growing fiber-based entertainment, communications and IT solutions company.
Our highlights for the quarter are summarized on slide six and demonstrate this team's continued ability to execute on our financial and operational objectives. Demand for our strategic products generated 4% year-over-year revenue growth and resulted in a strong adjusted EBITDA totaling $79 million.
Now turning to our wireless business, we successfully transitioned all subscribers off our network and shutdown all business operations. In April, we transferred certain tower lease obligations and assets to Verizon and have now started the process of decommissioning the network.
Next, to our investment in CyrusOne. In the past, we communicated our goal was to be a patient investor and use proceeds for monetizing this asset to repay debt and improve the health of our balance sheet. In April, we completed the second sale of this asset for cash proceeds totaling $426 million. In the weeks leading up to the sale, CyrusOne was trading at a record high and we again executed a swift and well-timed transaction. We have done exactly what we said we would do and our strategy has been successful.

In total to-date, we have monetized 78% of our ownership in CyrusOne paying down $1 billion in debt and reducing interest payments by approximately $85 million. Subsequent to the sale, we maintained a 22% ownership stake in CyrusOne, which is valued at approximately $450 million and sheltered by a $525 million NOL. We remain bullish on CyrusOne, and we'll continue to be a patient investor with the goal of maximizing our shareholder value.
Now turning back to our operational results on slide seven. The future success of Cincinnati Bell now relies on our ability to grow our strategic revenue and translate that growth into profit. Strategic revenue increased 22% compared to the prior year, and now accounts for more than 50% of our total recurring revenue. Strategic business revenue has grown by more 16% year-over-year, as we continue to foster relationships with our largest customers.
Consumer strategic revenue increased 34% compared to the prior year, demonstrating the continued demand for faster data speeds and further supports our decision to accelerate the expansion of our Fioptics network. During the quarter, we passed over 22,000 new addresses with Fioptics and the product is currently available to approximately 44% of Greater Cincinnati. Our Fioptics highlights are presented on slide eight.
Fioptics revenue for the quarter totaled $42 million, which is up more than 35% over the prior year and penetration rates remain consistent, even as we aggressively expanded our Fioptics coverage. Our churn results for the quarter were at the lowest rates in the past 12 months, and single family churn is approaching 2%. In addition, ARPU for the quarter was up on average 6% compared to prior year. Fioptics' net activations also continue to be impressive, as we added more than 4,000 video subscribers and a record high 9,400 Fioptics Internet subs during the quarter. More importantly, our total Internet subscriber count, which includes legacy DSL customers, increased sequentially, even as our main competitor recently reported the highest quarterly subscriber net adds since 2007.
We compete in a constantly evolving competitive environment and any news of change creates more opportunity for us to win our share of the Cincinnati marketplace. Regardless of the competition, we believe fiber is a superior asset with long-term relevancy and our goal is to get Fioptics in the hands of as many customers as soon as possible. As we've communicated several times, our investment decisions remain success-based and we continue to actively monitor the key metrics that drive returns, especially during this acceleration process. We had a tremendous start to the year and are in a great position to achieve our objectives for 2015.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Leigh, to provide additional details on the first quarter results.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Ted, and good afternoon everyone. As Ted mentioned, we are off to an exciting start to the year and our strategic investments continue to positively impact our financial results.
As highlighted on slide 10, revenue for the quarter totaled $293 million, growing 4% compared to the prior year resulting in strong adjusted EBITDA of $79 million. Net income for the quarter was $49 million, including the recognition of the $113 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum. Starting this quarter, current and prior year financial results from the wireless business will be presented as discontinued operations.
Moving to our segment results, starting on slide 11. Entertainment and Communications revenue for the quarter totaled $188 million increasing year-over-year for each of the past six quarters, as demand for our strategic products continues to outpace legacy declines.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter equaled $75 million, resulting in 40% margin that are in line with expectations when considering the cost absorbed from shutting down the wireless business and accelerating our fiber investment. Access line loss remained elevated for the quarter at 10% due to the high turnover of wireless subscribers and the migration of business customers from copper-based access lines to VoIP lines. As of the end of the quarter, we had 69,000 VoIP access line equivalents, up from 50,000 a year ago. Adjusting for the inclusion of VoIP lines, our total access line loss has been a consistent 6% over the past several quarters.
Turning to slide 12, the IT Services and Hardware segment generated revenues totaling $108 million for the quarter, up 6% from the prior year as the growth in strategic managed and professional services revenue offset anticipated declines in hardware sales. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $8 million, resulting in margins of 7%, both consistent with the prior year.
Starting on slide 13, we have included an update on our capital structure subsequent to the recent sale of CyrusOne. The completion of this transaction has not only limited our exposure and risk associated with owning a large equity investment, but has also significantly increased our operational flexibility and expanded the opportunities to efficiently manage our capital structure.
As noted on the slide, proceeds from the sale totaled $426 million and were used to repay our highest coupon notes, decreasing interest payments by $26 million annually. Our adjusted liquidity now exceeds $300 million and our updated leverage ratio is 4.5 times. If leverage was further adjusted to include our remaining 22% ownership in CyrusOne, our leverage would be 2.9 times, well within an appropriate range.
Moving to slide 14, free cash flow was negative $36 million and capital expenditures totaled $58 million in the first three months of the year. During the quarter, we invested $35 million in Fioptics, including $17 million to pass an additional 22,000 new addresses. Capital expenditures to increase core network capacity totaled $13 million and installation costs were $5 million. In addition, fiber builds for business and managed services projects equaled $14 million. Interest payments in the quarter totaled $21 million and cash dividends from CyrusOne equaled $6 million.
For the year, interest payments are now expected to total $110 million and dividends received from CyrusOne are anticipated to be $24 million after considering our new ownership percentage. First quarter free cash flow results included pension and OPEB payments of $5 million. As a result of stronger than anticipated asset returns and changes in regulations, we now expect full year payments to total $25 million, which should trend down to approximately $15 million in 2016.
In closing, we have repeatedly executed on each of the milestones required to achieve our transformation and goals of creating a company with growing revenues, profits and significant cash flows. Our first quarter results were outstanding and we are confident that we will achieve revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year.
This concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thanks for listening. We will now turn the conference open to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

We will go first to Dave Barden with Bank of America.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first I guess maybe, Ted, on the line loss comments. I think you were saying that the line losses have been elevated because of the wireless shutdown. But at the same time looking at the totality of VoIP in line losses, things have been kind of constant. So is the expectation then as we go forward that we should be seeing kind of a net improvement both in absolute line losses and then in that combination of line in VoIP? And then just second, just to understand your comments around competition and the kind of winding down of the Comcast, Time Warner Cable deal. I know that you guys had a fairly aggressive game plan that you were pitching or planning to pitch during this deal. I guess, it's probably still going to go ahead, but, I know you said, there is opportunity here, but if you could be more specific it'd be great. Thanks.

Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the question. First of all on access lines, I think you got to break it out into consumer and business. And if you look at consumer, we had the wireless shutdown, and we attributed about 4,000 subs to that shutdown, which should not reoccur. Then we had about 3,100 that were competition driven and Time Warner was offering a very aggressive credit, it was a $300 credit for a starting offer and we don't know how long that will continue. But the wireless shutdown seriously is behind us.
On the business side, churn was about 7% in the quarter, which is up a little bit, but it's primarily due to the customers transferring to VoIP. So if you look at the equivalents, we total on the VoIP line equivalents about 69,000 as Leigh said, which is an increase of about 2,000 compared to a year ago. So again, we think it should stabilize and actually get better than what the loss has been due to the wireless on the consumer side.
As far as competition is concerned, I mean first of all, Time Warner is very aggressive. They are a very good strong competitor. They have been all along. So we've learned how to compete, we actually feel our product is superior and we're very confident that we'll be able to continue to perform at the levels that we have. So we see the Comcast deal – it just provides us more time to build-out our fiber to more homes and it just gives us time that we needed to remain extremely competitive. So we see it as a real positive.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good. All right. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes, thanks. If you could just kind of walk us through the changes in the pension and OPEB, be a little more clear on that, that would be helpful. And then I've got a follow up.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Frank, this is Leigh. Yeah, so asset returns were a lot more favorable than we had planned and then with the half the changes also. And then we've used a little bit of the proceeds of CyrusOne to prepay pension. So that's a lot of what you're hearing from us. So forecasted cash impact of OPEB and pension, we're looking at approximately $25 million this year, dropping to $15 million next year.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
As long as asset returns remain solid.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, just on the promotional activity with Fioptics, has that continued, do you feel the need to match any of that to try and grab some market share? And then walk us through what if any sort of your strategy is on trying to capture share on over-the-top with any sort of streaming apps or things you might embed in your product that maybe the completion doesn't have? Thanks.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we expect Time Warner to continue to be competitive. And we're well positioned to compete directly with them. So in the future, we think the promotions will continue and we'll be able to offer something that's extremely competitive. So we're well set and well positioned for that.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
On the product side, Frank, yeah, we're in constant development. Our CTO, Tom Simpson, has a team that develops – constantly developing products and interfaces that integrate over-the-top. So, yeah, we're absolutely looking at it. We think different types of product offerings for different tiers of customers is what will be extremely relevant in the future and that's our goal and that's where we're migrating from a product development standpoint.

Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. Great. Thank you.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Frank.
Operator
Now let's take our next question from Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. Couple of questions. First on the wireline revenue side. Growth is strong, but it came down slightly on a sequential basis. Is that mostly due to some hits on the wireless backlog side? And when do you expect that pressure to lift? And second question on the ARPU, Fioptics and video ARPU were down slightly in the quarter. Was that also a function of the promotions you talked about or is there some timing in terms of the price increases that you pass through on the video side?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Batya, on the wireline revenue, yeah, that was absolutely a function of the wireless, some of the gap rolls in discontinued ops, you're going to see some funkiness from quarter-to-quarter. At the end of the first quarter – the first quarter of 2015 would be the last quarter that you see that, so you'll see that trending out over time. But yes, the main issue there was that the wireless backhaul from the wireless shutdown. And I'll toss it to Ted on the ARPU.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. ARPU is really driven by the promotions we've offered. And again, remaining very competitive with Time Warner.
Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe if I could ask another one. If you could talk a little bit about what kind of small cell build-out you're seeing in the region? And if they are on your – if they touch your fiber footprint right now, some of the recent fiber deals we've seen in the market had received great multiples. Can you talk about, if there are other strategic options you would consider for your fiber asset?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think we've built out 36 sites so far with small cells. We are getting a lot of interest as far as quotes, but we did win a $30 million deal that's over several years. But there is a lot of interest that seems to be increasing over the period of time, it continues to increase. But we have won one order, and we're very well positioned within the city to win.
Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you very much. Nice job on the margins. If I look at the annualizing Q1, you're above the top end of your full-year guidance and your top line is growing. Are there any kind of puts and takes that might impact margins in the coming quarters? And then there's been a lot of talk about the future of TV. Verizon's got their skinny bundles. Dish has Sling TV. AT&T is scaling up. How do you think about the profitability of TV, the future of TV and how you position the company for that? Thanks.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Simon, well, thanks for the comments on the margin. It is a primary focus for us to continue to be extremely competitive on margins and to do what we can to remove cost. As the wireless business wound down last year, we absorbed about $25 million of cost that is now behind us and is absorbed within the business. So we're going to continue to focus on cost as well as trying to drive as much price as possible.
I think we've said in previous calls that our margins would be in the high 30%s. We think that that's probably the low point and we'll do everything we can to get it up into the 40%s, in the low 40% margin range.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Simon. This is Leigh. For the year, really what we're expecting and what we said is lower hardware for the year, which will impact margin dollars and our EBITDA. So yeah, from a trending standpoint, it does look like we're ending up just about the higher end of the range, but we're still pretty comfortable with our guidance range.

Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, good. And on the TV?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
From the standpoint of technology, yeah, look, we stay abreast to all the movement in the industry. Obviously it's like the Wild West right now. But we are huge believers that ultimately it comes down to having the best and biggest pipe to the home, period, and that's what we focus on. We've got a fantastic product team, fantastic technology folks looking at this. We believe Verizon's look at a skinny bundle is probably what the customers want for the future, over-the-top optionality as mentioned earlier in the call, and the other thing that customers want. So yeah, we stay abreast and on top of everything, but ultimately the big pipe wins.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And you're okay with the profitability you're seeing with the content cost to inflation on the TV line, product line?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I'll be okay with it, and continues to get squeezed, there's no doubt about it, but the ability to bundle that product with broadband is so important. And so we look for other ways to take cost out as well as trying to get margin. So that's where the focus is. And so far, we've been very successful, we plan to do the same in the future.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli & Company.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions if I could. First, tw telecom was one of your main competitors in the enterprise space in Greater Cincinnati area and obviously they were taken over by Level 3. Could you comment on whether you saw any changes in competitive intensity since that merger took place. And whether you were seeing anything different from the combined company?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sergey, we have not seen a lot of additional competition especially in the enterprise space. The thing that we have is we have excellent relationships in Cincinnati with the enterprise customer base. And actually we're seeing growth in our largest customers. So we really haven't seen any strong competition from that merger at all.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Okay. And another question maybe a bigger picture question. Obviously, Fioptics is your primary growth opportunity that is in front of you and this is your primary focus. But could you share your thoughts on maybe other sources of growth that you see over time that could become meaningful whether it would be cloud, hosting, managed services, just any color on additional sources of growth?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, one of the moves we've recently made is, and we're putting a lot of focus on is the commercial SMB marketplace. As we talked earlier the migration of companies from TDM to VoIP, we lose about 30 points of margin, 30 points to 40 points. This gives us a hole that we in the past we've tried to manage down. What we're trying to do is develop a product line and bundle that we can then fill that hole with. So we think there's a big opportunity in that marketplace and we're putting a lot of focus in there to develop products such as you said, to grow in that space. So we think that's a big opportunity. The other thing is taking those products in other regions or in other markets, we're in Columbus, Louisville and Indianapolis, and they're all very applicable there as well.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Arun Seshadri with Credit Suisse.
Arun A. Seshadri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple. Is there any way you would be able to sort of look at, if you look at EBITDA without the wireless shutdown cost, is there any way you could sort of break out sort of how much, what EBITDA would have been excluding that?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. We do look at, Arun, this is Leigh. We do look at that currently. So we do look at adjusted EBITDA on trending basis for that. And for the most part, that gets a little bit clouded because some of the investments we've made. Obviously what we said in the past is, as you invest in fiber, the acceleration of that investment digs a bit of a hole initially. But if you look at it over time, I mean it's declining slightly, but you see it flattening out. And I think when you adjust for those investments and accelerating your fiber optics, it looks a lot more plausible from the standpoint of turning the corner from a profitability standpoint. So a lot of what we look at is that EBITDA on adjusted basis.
Arun A. Seshadri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then as far as your bonds, your senior unsecured bonds, obviously callable this year later on. What are your current thoughts in terms of potentially refinancing that? Are there any other discussions in terms of switching to between a fixed and a floating cap structure, any thoughts around that? Thanks.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Thoughts around all of it, we're looking at it all very closely. Obviously with the most recent moves, with the sub-notes, and I do want to highlight we have, as of today, we no longer have sub-notes on the balance sheet, which is a great thing for this company. But, yes, we are looking at that right now. We've got a strategy going forward. We're obviously keeping a very close eye on high yield market. But, yeah, we're obviously analyzing that on a weekly basis.
Arun A. Seshadri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.

Let's take our next question from Ana Goshko with Bank of America.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thanks very much. So on the wireless shutdown you mentioned that you're going to be taking down the cell sites from the tower that weren't transferred. What's the cash cost of that, and I assume that's going to go through the income from discontinued operations? How long is that going to last and when does that go away?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Ana, this is Leigh. The costs are already embedded in the ARO liability. So this is an ongoing operation. We are accelerating it a little bit. We had initially planned from a cash flow standpoint this to hit over a two-year period. But what we decided from a operational efficiency standpoint was to just do it all at once and get it all done. It was much more efficient and actually saved us a little bit of money. But the dollars we're talking are not major. I believe there are around $10 million to $15 million. And again, it's already on the balance sheet.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then when you say accelerated it, is that over a quarter, two or ...
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
No – I'm sorry, over the year. So we had initially projected to do that as slowly as possible. So that $10 million to $15 million we had spread out a few years, but just looking at the efficiency, we'll shoot to have that done this year.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then, so I know you said that there was $25 million of leases that got transferred on April 1. So if we pro forma the balance sheet, it would take $25 million off the balance sheet. Is that correct?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. It gets a little more complicated than that with discontinued operations and if you look at the financials. I would start there and then if you have questions, we could walk you through – after the call, we could walk you through discontinued ops. But it's a little trickier than that.

Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. So hopefully, well, let me just ask. So then, in your net debt table in your press release, on the capital leases and other, that went up by $54 million over the quarter, from $16 million to $70 million. And I wasn't able to tie that to the cash flow statement, maybe it's just me, but I was just wondering what that $54 million increase was?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
The $54 million increase was associated with the transfer of the lease obligations, the remaining lease obligations to the core business effectively.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. So, I am confused. So I'll follow up afterwards.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we'll follow up afterwards.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
But the best way to think about it is – all right.
Ana Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Davis Hebert with Wells Fargo.
Davis s Hebert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Actually, Leigh, maybe if you could finish that thought, I'd be curious to hear the best way to think about it is?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the best way to think, prior to the close of the business, those assets and liabilities sit in the wireless business. And then effectively what's remaining – what just shifted over into the balance sheet on the core business was the remaining liability, the obligation of the remaining leases. And the best way to think about it, it's just debt, right. We now have a debt obligation for capital leases. We have contracts on those and the way I think of it, that's just debt for the core business, and we'll pay that off over time. Josh, do you have any other comments on that?
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
Yeah. Well, so if you look at the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 as presented, it'll be presented in the 10-Q we file in the morning. Those liabilities were presented as liabilities from discontinued operations at 12/31/2014 once we shutdown wireless, because they'll become the liability of the continuing operations. Those liabilities are moving out of disc ops as a liability, and into debt on the balance sheet. So that is the $50 million -
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
That's right.
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
...that you're seeing. And the $25 million that Ana was referring to is sitting at discontinued operations liabilities in both periods.
Davis s Hebert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, understood.
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
We can talk offline.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, discontinued ops was pretty complex. Josh and the team did a good job, and we'll go through a lot of detail in the Q, but if you have any questions, which I have a feeling we'll have quite a few, please call us.
Davis s Hebert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then on backhauls, some of your peers have talked about the near-term pressure as things switch from TDM to Ethernet. And you have a small cell contract. So just kind of wonder if you could talk directionally, would you expect backhaul revenue to have a positive trajectory year-over-year over the next 12 months?
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
Yeah, we think it would be slightly positive.
Davis s Hebert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then last question from me. I think you had some retail stores you are keeping after the divestiture of the wireless business. Just curious how that's working out for you, do you feel like it's something you want to continue longer-term?

Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
Yeah, we have eight stores. We've converted them all to Fioptics stores where they're not only selling, but demonstrating our product as well as servicing for customers. So every one of them is a great experience and we're finding out some very good channel for sales.
Davis s Hebert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thank you.

Good day, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Cincinnati Bell Earnings Release Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'll like to turn the conference over to Mr. Josh Duckworth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joshua T. Duckworth - Chief Accounting Officer, VP-Investor Relations and Controller
Thank you, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to Cincinnati Bell's fourth quarter earnings call. With me on the call today is our Chief Executive Officer, Ted Torbeck; and our Chief Financial Officer, Leigh Fox. Ted's comments will summarize our 2014 accomplishments and our strategic objectives for 2015. Leigh will provide an update on our fourth quarter and full year financial results in addition to our 2015 financial guidance. Following Leigh's discussion, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
Before we proceed, let me remind you that our earnings release and financial statements are posted on our Investor Relations website. In addition, you'll also find presentation slides for today's call, which we hope you will find helpful in your analysis. Today's call is being recorded if you would like to listen to it at a future time.
Now, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement presented on slide three. In our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those indicated or suggested by any such forward-looking statements.
More information on potential risks and uncertainties is available in the company's recent filings with the SEC, including Cincinnati Bell's annual Form 10-K report, quarterly Form 10-Q reports, and Form 8-K reports. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.
With that, I am pleased to introduce Cincinnati Bell's Chief Executive Officer, Ted Torbeck.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Josh, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. My comments today will provide a recap of our recent accomplishments and summarize our 2015 outlook.
2014 was truly a turning point for Cincinnati Bell. As highlighted on slide six, the company grew Wireline revenue on a full-year basis for the first time since 2007. We sold our wireless spectrum and have begun turning down those operations. And we also sold a significant tranche of our investment in CyrusOne, using the proceeds to repay over $300 million of debt. And we initiated the process to accelerate our fiber investments. All this was accomplished while still generating positive free cash flow and achieving our full-year financial guidance.
The charts on slide seven further highlight the progress we are making on our transformational initiatives. Strategic revenue for the year totaled $436 million, and has increased more than 15% annually, since 2012. In what is now considered our core business, increasing demand for strategic products has resulted in revenue growth, each of the past three years. More importantly, revenue from fiber-based products and IT solutions accounted for almost 50% of our recurring revenue base in 2014. This is a mark we expect to eclipse this year.

On slide eight, we provide an update on the wind down of our wireless operations. In 2013, after becoming CEO of Cincinnati Bell, I communicated the need to sell our Wireless business. These decisions are always difficult, but I firmly believe that we needed to gracefully exit a business where we would always be limited by scale and thus struggle to provide the best product to our customers. In the third quarter of 2014, we closed the agreement to sell our wireless spectrum licenses to Verizon for a $194 million of cash. In the next few months, we will close our wireless operations and transfer $25 million of capital lease obligations and other assets to Verizon.
I would like to commend our wireless team for their efforts this year, and their commitment to Cincinnati Bell's customers in such a challenging environment. During this tough period, we transitioned approximately 75% of our wireless subscribers to other carriers, while still generating wireless adjusted EBITDA of $44 million, and free cash flow of approximately $35 million.
Now, turning to our CyrusOne investment on slide nine. In the second quarter of this year, we sold $16 million CyrusOne partnership units for $356 million, using the proceeds to repay debt. At the time of the sale, it's critical to show the investment community that we could play the role of both successful business operators and thoughtful investors.
This was a well-timed and well-executed transaction, which not only increased our net cash flow by $15 million annually, but it also increased CyrusOne's public float and alleviated much of the perceived overhang from our significant ownership.
Subsequent to the sale, the share value of CyrusOne has increased by approximately 25%, and is traded as high as $30. As of the end of the year, our 44% ownership interest was valued at $785 million. In addition, we continue to maintain a $740 million tax NOL to shelter any future gains.
Looking ahead, we will continue evaluating opportunities to monetize this investment. We are encouraged by CyrusOne's consistently strong financial performance and their announcement yesterday to increase their dividend by 50%, which puts the dividend yield well in line with their peers.
As we've stated in the past, we believe that projecting any intent regarding our position at CyrusOne, destroys shareholder value. With that said, we continue to be committed to maximizing value by executing a well-timed and thoughtfully coordinated monetization plan that balances the upside growth in CyrusOne with our goal of reducing leverage.
The completion of the wireless transaction and our strategy for monetizing CyrusOne has increased operational and capital flexibility. It also provides us the ability to focus on our fiber investments. Our Fioptics suite of products is currently available to more than 40% of Greater Cincinnati. And we plan to expand that coverage to between 70% and 80% over the next few years.
Revenue from Fioptics exceeding $140 million in 2014, growing more than 40% on average each year, since we launched the product in 2009. Over that same period, our subscriber base has increased on average 30% annually, and penetration has remained steady, even as we aggressively increased our market coverage.
Our goal is to get our fiber products in the hands of as many consumers as soon as possible. The ongoing success of Fioptics, combined with our unique market opportunity gives us the confidence to accelerate our fiber investments. As we progress into 2015, our strategic objectives remain constant. First, we are focused on efficiently deploying our fiber network. We continue to believe in the quality and long-term relevance of our fiber assets, and are confident that we will provide attractive returns.

In addition to our success with Fioptics, I am also pleased to announce, we recently secured a $30 million, multi-year small cell agreement with a national carrier. We believe this win is in the first step in a much broader opportunity for us, as we are uniquely positioned with both networking and wireless expertise. All of our investments remain success-based and we will continue to actively monitor all the key metrics that drive return.
Second, we also remain intently focused on the health of our balance sheet. During the past two years, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $400 million and reduced interest payments by more than $50 million. We remain in a friendly interest rate environment and will continue evaluating opportunities to improve our cash flow and our balance sheet.
In closing, 2014 was an exceptional year for Cincinnati Bell, and I am extremely proud of our progress. We achieved our 2014 financial guidance, generated year-over-year Wireline revenue growth, and produced positive free cash flow. In addition, we completed the sale of our wireless spectrum and paid down approximately 15% of our outstanding debt with proceeds from CyrusOne monetization. These accomplishments prove we are capably successfully transforming Cincinnati Bell into a fiber-based telecommunications and IT company with growing revenue, profits, and cash flow.
I'd like to now turn the call over to Leigh to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our 2015 financial guidance.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As Ted mentioned, 2014 was a great year for us, both operationally and financially. Our revenue and adjusted EBITDA results are highlighted on slide 11. Consolidated revenue for the year totaled $1.3 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year, as demand for strategic products and increased hardware sales more than offset Wireless and legacy revenue decline. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $379 million, with net income totaling $76 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share for the year of $0.31.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was consistent with the prior year, totaling $308 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $78 million, down from the prior year, primarily due to shutting down the Wireless operations, increased costs associated with accelerating our fiber investments and the impact of other non-recurring expenses related to our Wireline segment.
Our segment results start on slide 12. Wireline revenue for the quarter totaled $188 million, up $6 million from a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenue for business customers totaled $42 million, up 8% on strong demand for Metro Ethernet and VoIP products.
Consumer strategic revenue was up $10 million, driven largely by the 40% increase in Fioptics revenue. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $74 million for the quarter, resulting in margins of 39%. Margins were impacted by the previously mentioned one-time expenses, and in line with our expectations.
Turning to slide 13, Fioptics annual revenue totaled $142 million in 2014, and the product is now available to 335,000 addresses or 41% of our market. We ended the year with 114,000 Fioptics Internet subscribers, up more than 40% compared to the prior year, as customers continue to demand faster Internet speed.
We also ended 2014 with 91,000 video subscribers, up more than 20%, compared to the prior year. Fioptics ARPU by product increased on average 8%, compared to a year ago as video ARPU totaled $79 and Internet ARPU totaled $40 during the quarter. Churn continues to remain relatively constant and penetration rates have remained strong, even as we have continued to aggressively build out our fiber network and scale our operations.

Moving to slide 14, the IT Services and Hardware segment generated revenues totaling $110 million for the quarter, up $23 million from the prior year on higher than anticipated hardware sales. Strategic and managed professional services revenue totaled $37 million, an increase of 17%. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income both – were both up $2 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 6%, which is consistent with the prior period.
Slide15 details our cash flow results. For the year, we generated $12 million of free cash flow. In 2014, cash flow was impacted by capital expenditures of $182 million, interest payments of $153 million, and pension and post-retirement payments of $31 million.
Looking forward to 2015, we expect interest payments to decrease by approximately $35 million and pension and post-retirement payments to remain flat. In addition, CyrusOne announced that would increase its dividend 50% to be more in line with its peer group. As a result, if we maintain our current ownership level in 2015, we would expect to receive $33 million in cash dividend.
Turning to slide 16. Capital expenditures totaled $182 million for the year, coming in at the low-end of the communicated range. In 2014, we invested $50 million on the construction of Fioptics passing 59,000 addresses. We also invested $24 million in installation and $19 million to support other platform and IT enhancement as well as network upgrades to support additional traffic for both residential and business customers.
Capital expenditures for success-based fiber builds business and managed services projects totaled $37 million. As noted on this slide, our goal is to pass 100,000 additional homes with Fioptics in 2015. We expect construction costs to be between $80 million and $85 million next year to achieve this goal.
In addition, we are forecasting installation cost to be approximately $40 million. We also expect to invest $40 million in platform and IT enhancements and continued upgrades to the core network to support increased traffic. Our strategic capital investments are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for other projects, including capital required to deploy small cell as a part of the agreements mentioned earlier during Ted's comments.
In total, 2015 capital expenditures are expected between – to be in the range between $270 million and $280 million. Our 2015 guidance is presented on slide 17. We expect revenues of $1.1 billion in line with the current year results excluding Wireless. 2015 revenues will be impacted by a forecasted decline in non-recurring hardware sales as we do not expect to repeat the success we experienced in 2014, with the sale of these lower margin products.
We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $297 million plus or minus 2% inclusive of costs being absorbed as a result of shutting down the Wireless business, costs associated with accelerating our fiber investments and the impact of declining hardware sales as noted on slide 18.
As highlighted on today's call, the investments we are making in our strategic products will be the catalyst for driving future revenue growth, increased profitability and – increased probability and producing significant cash flows.
Our goals this year center around efficiently executing our Fioptics acceleration plan and evaluating market opportunities to improve the health of our balance sheet. I'm confident in our strategy and our continued ability to successfully transform Cincinnati Bell under a growing fiber-based entertainment and IT solutions company.
This concludes the prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. We will now turn over the conference to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

Thank you. And we'll take – we'll take our first question from Batya Levi with UBS.
Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. You – I wanted to ask you about the Wireline revenue expectations. You had very solid growth in 2014. And looking into 2015, I know there's going to be some headwinds as you see pressure from wireless backhaul revenues. But what are your thoughts of Wireline revenues in general?
Do you think that as you balance more Fioptics adds and the pricing pressures that you're seeing, could we still expect that to continue to grow? And on the Fioptics, can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? You brought on more homes through this footprint, but the net adds fell somewhat sequentially. What were some of the drivers of that? And as you look out to bring on about 100,000 more homes, what is your expectation for take rates for next year? Thank you.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. First on the Wireline revenue. We continue to see growth opportunities in 2015. So we expect still to see additional growth in our numbers. So what is it – that's 2%?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Yeah. We expect consistent Wireline growth. Obviously, we – it's a – even with the Wireline, it's a competitive – you see competitive pressures both on the consumer and the business side. So we're balancing a lot of the same inputs into both businesses, which is basically a transition from TDM to SIP-based or IPE-based technologies.
But so far we've been able to overcome that especially on the consumer side with our investments in fiber, which is also helping on the business side. So yeah, we definitely – we expect fairly consistent growth.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
On the competition side, Time Warner has definitely gotten more aggressive, we've seen that especially in the DSL, the lower-end, lower meg customers that we have. We've seen a lot more aggressive actions from them. But we're doing very well. Our penetration rates are holding. When we open a neighborhood, we do extremely well and we're seeing good follow-up as we go back to re-sweep the neighborhood as well. So we're seeing a real positive response from our customers.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
And on your Fioptics question on take rates. The take rates are fairly cyclical during the year. We're not seeing anything that is alarming at all, so things remain consistent, penetration rates remain very solid. So we expect continued momentum.
Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.
Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. I'm staying on Fioptics. Your Internet adds on Fioptics were about 2X your TV adds. What's going on there? Is that cord-cutting that we're seeing or is that just say, some markets you went out with double play rather than triple play? And how that plays into maybe over the top of your thoughts about that?
And then, on the CapEx guidance, I think you had install CapEx up about two-thirds to $40 million, is that a good proxy for what your kind of gross Fioptics adds are going to be year-over-year in 2015? Thanks.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Well, one of the initiatives is really to get out there quicker with the Internet because of the need for speed. So we have put a strong emphasis on that, and that's why you're seeing that increase in Internet adds.
The other piece on – over-the-top is, we still feel that, that is going to be a – it's definitely growing, but it's still a relatively small number, and we feel that by putting the best pipe to the home or the business absolutely is the thing to do, and that's what we're really focused on doing. You still are going to need the largest, fastest pipe and that's where we're focused.

Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Simon, the plain answer to your question on Internet is exactly what Ted said. We shifted some operations because we had some bandwidth and we saw the demand in Internet. So we shifted some tech time and focused on installing Internet and squeezing some windows and we saw a really strong response to that at the end of the year. But – and it had – I think it had a lot more to do with that than any kind of macro trends.

And on 2015? The installed CapEx?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think to your point, yeah, I think it is indicative of what you should expect.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think it's very relative to 2014. We'll see basically the same.

And we'll take our next question from Barry McCarver with Stephens, Incorporated.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Ted, you mentioned your cable competition was targeting, I guess, a lower bandwidth customer. But just curious, any more color on what competition is doing in front of that, the big pending merger?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean they're – Time Warner is definitely being aggressive to get as many subs as they can. We'll win a customer, and they try to go back to them and offer a lower price. But again as you can see by our growth and the penetration rates, we're being very successful. And the other – they're doing things like not doing credit checks, which to us is not the way we want to run it. So, but we think we got a better product. We know we have a better product. And we're winning in the marketplace, so...
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. You definitely – Barry, you definitely saw some pre-deal fervor in the fourth quarter. And as Ted mentioned, we still came out with excellent results. So we feel like it just over emphasized our ability to compete, even in a toughening environment. But we do think it's kind of pre-deal items. And so this is probably – I don't know, the worst we'll see it from a competitive standpoint in behavior.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Is Cincinnati Bell thinking about any marketing campaigns around this merger to highlight what's going to happen to those customers?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You mean their customers?
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Right.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Time Warner customers?
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry – Time Warner customers.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we have a huge push on customer experience. And that's the – we're putting a big push on gig service as well. And a lot of communication around that. We have a big campaign about Light Up Cincinnati, where we're putting Wi-Fi at all the public places in Cincinnati. We're going to have an app that comes out, that will enable customers like the Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo that they can push forward information to customers and make the customer experience a lot better. And we're looking at other public venues to do that as well. So basically we're very proud of the product we have. And we're pushing the strengths of it. And that's speed which is what the customers want.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Very good. And then on your CapEx slide, I think it was slide 16, you guys mentioned an opportunity for small cell deployment. Is there anything specific on the drawing board there for 2015?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, as I've said, we won a significant – we had a significant win in the fourth quarter with a large carrier that we're very excited about. And there's a lot of opportunities going forward. And Barry, the interesting thing is the fact that we have wireless expertise is a big plus in winning these small cell, so we've actually transferred wireless engineers over to the carrier market business, and it's been very successful as they speak the same language as these carriers. It's been very, very successful.

Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
I got you.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So we're going to be aggressive there.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Good. That sounds good. And then just lastly, I guess in relationship to potentially selling some more CONE stock – sorry, somebody has to ask on every call, right?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
I know your thought process was to wait a little bit longer and maybe take on some more debt. I think that discussion happened with CONE a lot lower than $30. But I'm just kind of curious as to what opportunities to pay down debt, if it makes sense here in 2015, exists, if any?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well again, we're very pleased, I think it's paid off that we are a patient investor and we haven't jumped to sell, and we still think that their performance continues to get better and better, and the increasing dividend is also a big plus. So again, we're going to play the role of a patient investor, we're going to do the right thing for our shareholders and optimize and maximize the return that we can get with that investment.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
But to your point, Barry. We have a few debt milestone this year that we're focused on and paying special attention to sub notes drop from $104 million to $102 million and change on March 15th, and then the senior bonds become callable in October of this year. And as you get closer to that, the MPEs of refinancing and looking at different options become a lot more attractive. So we're paying a lot of attention to the capital structure this year, and we're extremely focused on it.
Barry L. McCarver - Stephens, Inc.
Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Barry.

And we'll take our next question from Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli & Company.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli Funds LLC
Good morning, guys.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Sergey.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli Funds LLC
I've a couple questions – hi – if I could. So on CONE, obviously you have indicated that your plan is to be a patient investor, and you would monetize it in a very thoughtful and well-timed manner, with a focus on reducing leverage. And I was wondering if you see any opportunities to accelerate the realization of value from your CONE investment via financial engineering that would allow you to maybe highlight the value of your stake, or realize a portion of the value sooner, while still leaving an option for you to benefit from potential upside in CONE.
For example, I don't know if you see creation of a tracking stock or a leverage tracker as viable options. And any other thoughts on financial engineering that potentially would not preclude you from following a strategy, but could accelerate or enhance the value of your CONE stake realization?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey, Sergey. Yeah, we've looked at pretty much every scenario that I and others could think of including many of the banks could think of with respect to different options and creative financial engineering. The issue with that is, and even at the current float, these are options that are probably just impactful on the periphery of what we do. There are still options, but they don't really move the needle much.
So there are definitely options in our bag of tricks that we continue to look at on an active basis. But from the standpoint of really moving the needle either with us or CONE, we don't feel like it's – there are really that many options that are really going to move the needle and highlight the value.

But we continue to look at it. And as we mentioned in both Ted and my scripts, it's a big part of what we're doing this year. We've got a very major focus on it, and are working with all of our partnership banks on different scenarios. Hope that's helpful.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli Funds LLC
Yeah, it is. And in terms of – I mean this is related question, and obviously it's also related to your focus on debt pay down. But if you could share your thoughts on what the right balance should be between returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging? And given your focus on deleveraging, at what point do you think buybacks would become a more viable tool for you guys?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think in the short-term, Sergey, we're obviously focused on delevering. As we stated in the past, buybacks are definitely an option. And there's always a balance as we look at it between where our stock price is trading, and where we believe the intrinsic value is versus debt pay down.
We've mentioned certain restrictions on how much cash we could use for different items. And to be honest, it's a little restrictive right now, but that's part of what we're looking at when we build plan for the overall capital structure is timing for more shareholder friendly returns on cash.
So it's definitely a part of the planning cycle that we're going through right now. And – but I would say in the short-term, it's going to be about repaying debt and getting some of the restrictions, taking care of and getting, I guess a healthier balance sheet, a more normalized look at leverage.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli Funds LLC
Right. And last question, you mentioned that Time Warner is going hard after your DSL customers because they're obviously the most vulnerable. I was wondering how are you planning to address the parts of the footprint that you probably won't be able to reach with Fioptics. Obviously, Fioptics is a focus. But those 20% or 25% of the footprint where you are able to have DSL, what kind of strategy you have those markets, and are you planning to raise speeds? And in the short-term, I guess, what is your immediate response to Time Warner going after those customers?
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, right now, our focus is to build out the fiber footprint as fast as possible. I mean that's the easiest way to hit the main part of the base that we can address. But to your point, there's always going to be customers kind of – on the outskirts that it doesn't make economic sense to build our fiber. And we're looking at – we're already looking at a few options through our CTO and some of the work that his groups are doing. Pair bonding is an option in some cases. We're also looking at possible Wi-Fi technology and how much speed you could drive through Wi-Fi into various neighborhood.
So, yeah, we're definitely looking at it. It is a part of addressing that. If we can get to 75%, it's addressing that 25% we can't get to. So we're not ignoring it. We're thinking through it. And by the time we get there, we do think we'll have some potential viable options that will bring attractive returns. But it's a little early on to kind of be too firm on that since the technologies are still being explored and are shipping on us also.
Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli Funds LLC
Thank you.

We'll take our next question from David Barden with Bank of America.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions; I guess two if I could. Just first with respect to the ramifications of the wireless wind-down, do you think that, that's had any kind of maybe near-term disruptive effect in the Wireline side of the business that might moderate into the first couple quarters of 2015?

And the second question would be, kind of looking at the Wireline segment, is it possible, Leigh, to give us some sense as to the relative margin contributions for the various big buckets, in terms of say the business margin relative to the consumer Fioptics margin, relative to the kind of non-strategic Wireline margin? Just so as these businesses are moving around, we could kind of get an understanding how the margins will be tracking going forward. Thanks.
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, David, these are good questions. The first – we definitely think there was some impact of the wireless wind-down on the Wireline business. That will subside in basically end of February, as most of our customers leave. It has had an impact on access lines and we think that, that with that – as transfers happen, we have lost customers that necessarily weren't looking to leave us. So we do think that will subside, and this is probably the last month that we will see an impact of that.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. On your margin question David, yeah I mean, I think we stated in the past that, we expect aggregate margins to begin to fall in line with what you saw in the fourth quarter, though the fourth quarter was impacted by a few one-time things that weren't Fioptics related. But we do expect things to continue to compress, I think we stated in the past that we expect in the high-30%s, and especially as you're growing, and you're spending a lot of money and focus on growth and installation.
I think the real question is, where does it normalize? We believe it probably normalizes a little higher as you become more efficient in running a business that you're not running so hard at installation and growth on. So I think, what we stated in the past is still pretty accurate from the standpoint of where we think margins will lay out. And obviously, if we see any different, we'll update you as that comes, but we see nothing that's changed from an aggregate basis on Wireline.
David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And just as a quick follow-up, Leigh, I guess just number one, could you just kind of elaborate a little bit on kind of the relative margin of kind of the legacy business versus consumer Fioptics versus business? And then the one-timers you mentioned in the 4Q that kind of hurt the margins, I'd love to know more about those too.
Leigh R. Fox - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I'll start with the latter. The one-time items were just items that we accrued for in order to be fairly conservative for things that we saw coming. That's all I really want to say about it, but they had an approximate $2 million to $4 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter.
On the relative margins, as much as I'd love to give you a straightforward answer, there's really not a straightforward answer on relative margins between the legacy business and the Fioptics business. Part of what we continue to battle on a daily basis is effectively managing two businesses on a single platform and managing the shipping of costs between a legacy declining business and a growing strategic business around Fioptics. I've looked and heard everything from the legacy business is at 85% margin, which I don't believe by the way when you fully allocate to, the Fioptics is lower.
So it's definitely a balance. The best way to really describe it is in the terms that we've described it to you. We really do believe that you'll see pressure, but we are constantly focused on shifting costs out of the legacy business, and shifting those over to the growth business. And I think that's probably the best way to think about it right now, any kind of relative margins I could give you would be a little bit of a high level guess at this point.

David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thanks, guys.

And we'll take our next question from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great, thank you. Back to the small cell opportunity, I would assume that this opportunity might expand a little outside your footprint where you've done wireless or where you have some other network, possibly to Dayton. And can you give us an idea of the number of RFPs that you've got that you're currently bidding on? And are these carriers providing you sort of upfront capital to help build these at all?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Frank. Thanks for the question. First of all, yes, we do get several bids that we're working on. And when I say several, it's more than three that we're looking at possibly that we're bidding on. Many of them are outside – carry outside our normal territory. And we also think this is a big opportunity in the future, and we're looking at how we can even expand it even further.
We're pretty excited about it – the opportunity. And again, I don't underestimate that we have expertise that our strong competitors don't have, and that's having the wireless experience and expertise as well. So that really does carry a lot of weight with the people that we're competing against.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And then should we think of 2015 as sort of a peak CapEx year? I mean, I guess even sort of excluding other small cell type builds and/or kind of success-based type contracts you might get, when should we think of CapEx sort of peaking here?
Theodore H. Torbeck - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We're not going to expand on 2016, but we did say, over the next few years that we'll be getting to 70% to 80% of the city covered. And that's really the main driver for the increase in CapEx. But again, I want to emphasize, this is extremely success based. And if we reach a point in time where we're not getting the returns, we're going to pull back.
So we think, that's why we got a estimate of 70% to 80%, somewhere in that range, we feel that we're going to reach the point where it's not given us the returns that we want and we're going to pull back on the capital spend.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you.

Cincinnati Bell Services Are Not Currently Available at This Address
The address you entered was not found in our service area. Please re-enter your address. Some tips to make your experience easier: 


Enter the first few letters of your street name, abbreviate directions using N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW and remove all street types (e.g. Court, Ave. etc.).For example the street name North Main Street should be entered as N Main
For numeric streets, try the plain numeric version first (e.g. 1 to indicate 1st Street). For example West 7th Street should be entered as W 7
If your street name includes a hyphen, try it with the hyphen and try it with a space instead of a hyphen.
