Payment Data Systems ( PYDS ) Shows Strength as FinTech Sector Continues M&A Activity


DEERFIELD BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / July 12, 2017 / <strike></strike>Payment Data Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:PYDS), an integrated electronic payment processor, recently announced its first quarter results, which showed marginal increase in the company's gross margins as the company managed to curtail its service expenses. It also showed encouraging growth for it's newly launched PINless debit product, which was launched in October last year. The company reported $3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents as on March 31, 2017 and had no debt.
While the company seems to be moving along, boosting its product portfolio and operational efficiency, it is the broader industrial developments which have put the company in the spotlight. Fintech sector has seen a rise in its M&A activity in the recent past. Towards the end of 2016, FactSet Research Systems, a leading financial analytics firm, announced the acquisition of Vermilion for $67 million, while insurance software provider Guidewire Software acquired ISCS for $160 million. However, the most notable development was the First Data Corp (FDC) announcement of its intent to acquire CardConnect Corp (CCN) for nearly $750 million. The deal valued the company stock at $15.00 per share, which led to a strong rally for the company stock in the market.
CardConnect is also an electronic payment processor, focusing on smaller payments. More recently is the Vantiv (VNTV) $10 Billion bid for Worldpay. These acquisitions may well set a trend for M&A activity in the segment, which may result in attractive options for Payment Data Systems.
Image: http://www.accesswire.comfile:///C:/Users/Aaron/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Dreamweaver%20CS6/en_US/OfficeImageTemp/clip_image001.gif
With annual revenue of $589.32 million for the year ending on December 2016, CardConnect commanded the price of $750 million. The company posted its net loss for the period at $16 million. Payment Data Systems, on the other hand, reported $12 million in revenue and $1.2 million in net loss for the same time period. First Data priced the company stock at $15 apiece, which resulted in P/E ratio of -17.44 as the diluted EPS of CardConnect stood at ($0.86) per share. However using the forward P/E ratio as provided by FT Partners for CardConnect at 39.5 times, Payment Data Systems is conveniently valued at north of $70 million even using the EPS of -$0.15 it reported for the year 2016. P/E ratio of 39.5 values the company stock at $5.93 apiece. The company currently has 11.83 million shares outstanding, taking its value to $70.15 million. The current flurry of M&A activities in the electronic payment processing segment is a good omen as it shows the maturity of the market and consequent consolidation.
However, as we measure the attractiveness of Payment Data Systems as a target, the company is also in the process of capturing higher market share by making some purchases itself. The company recently announced making changes to its Letter of Intent for acquiring Singular Payments LLC. The change allows for more time for Payment Data Systems to carry out its due diligence. However, this change is not likely to have any material impact on the process. As the companies expect to complete the process well before the end of the year, it is likely that the impact of the acquisition will be visible on the full year performance of the company. Singular Payments LLC is engaged in the business of transaction processing, a St. Augustine, Florida based company founded in 2009. Singular Payments has processed 2.5 million transactions through its system worth $440 million. Payment Data Systems is expected to draw synergies from this acquisition as it combines the technological expertise of Singular Payments for boosting its operations. Singular specializes in designing payment processing software systems for healthcare industry.
Payment Data Systems CEO Louis Hoch said that the acquisition is expected to be accretive and will accelerate the growth potential of the company. It is also expected to create new revenue streams for the company. At the moment, it is difficult to compute the impact as the companies chose not to disclose the sales price and other terms and conditions of the transaction. However, looking at the operational areas of the companies, it is reasonable to expect that Payment Data Systems will be able to consolidate the businesses to attain efficiency and cost control as it looks to reverse the trend of posting net losses. The company announced its revenue for the first quarter of the year at $2.8 million while its CEO claimed that its "operating expenses were down year-over-year on an absolute basis." The process of expense optimization is expected to be further boosted with this acquisition.
Payment Data Systems ( PYDS ) is currently trading close to its 52 week low at $1.25. With the announcement of strong quarterly results and upcoming completion of its acquisition of Singular Payments, the stock is likely to show strength and resume upward movement. The main growth drivers for the stock price will include the company's growing cost efficiencies and the addition of new revenue streams.

CMS’s 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule Would Slash Non-Excepted Provider-Based Department Payments

	The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released its 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule on July 13, 2017. The proposed rule, among other things, proposes to cut Medicare payments for services provided at non-excepted, off-campus provider-based departments from 50% to 25% of the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) rate for the 2018 calendar year.

	Currently, non-excepted, off-campus provider-based departments are paid for certain items and services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule at a payment rate equal to 50% of the OPPS payment rate for the applicable item or service.  The current payment rate has only been in place since January.  CMS said in the proposed rule that it viewed the 2017 rates as “transitional policy,” but few people in the industry were likely expecting to see such a significant decrease in payment so soon.  CMS openly admits, however, that it is working with a limited set of payment data since it does not have claims data from calendar year 2017 and that additional analysis is needed.  CMS said it welcomes stakeholder input with regard to its initial analysis and the proposal to pay for the applicable services at 25% of the OPPS.  In fact, CMS specifically requested comment on whether it should adopt a different payment rate, such as 40% of the OPPS, that would represent a middle ground between the current rates and the proposed rate. If finalized, the payment cut would further disincentive hospitals from opening or operating new (i.e., non-excepted) off-campus provider-based locations.

	Some of the key additional changes proposed by CMS in the 1,000+ page proposed rule include:


Medicare Telehealth Services.  CMS is proposing to add several codes to the list of covered telehealth services, including: HCPCS code G0296 (visit to determine low dose computed tomography (LDCT) eligibility); CPT code 90785 (Interactive Complexity); CPT codes 96160 and 96161 (Health Risk Assessment); HCPCS code G0506 (Care Planning for Chronic Care Management); and CPT codes 90839 and 90840 (Psychotherapy for Crisis).

Retroactive PQRS and Value Modifier Adjustments.  CMS is also proposing to reduce or eliminate certain financial penalties for performance in 2016 under the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) and the Value Modifier program.  Under PQRS, for example, CMS says it wants to retroactively reduce the number of metrics that physicians had to report on in PQRS from nine to six measures.  For the Value Modifier, CMS proposes to reduce the automatic downward adjustment for not meeting minimum quality reporting requirements from negative four percent to negative two percent for groups of ten or more clinicians and from negative two percent to negative one percent for physician and non-physician solo practitioners and groups of two to nine clinicians.

Evaluation and Management Comment Solicitation.  CMS is seeking comment from stakeholders on specific changes it should undertake to “update the guidelines, to reduce the associated burden, and to better align” Evaluation and Management coding and documentation with the current practice of medicine.


	The advanced copy of the Proposed Rule is available here.  The official version of the Proposed Rule is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register on July 21, 2017.  Comments on the Proposed Rule are due by September 11, 2017.

The way that we shop and pay for purchases has drastically changed over the last couple of years. For instance, it’s not uncommon to order and pay for your dinner from your favorite restaurant while commuting home. Or, you can pay for your dinner, then pick it up while you are in route home, or even have it delivered about the time you arrive at your destination.
While this new ease of access to commodities definitely improves the journey of your customer, it can get overwhelming for business owners. The key is to centralize and embrace all of this payment data that’s at your fingertips. Once you gather all of the information to a central location, you’ll realize that it’s not all that complicated. And, more importantly, you’ll eventually increase your revenue.

1. Supports Cross-Channel Customer Journeys
Customers today use their mobile phone to find directions to your store. They search your website for prices and reviews. They expect to be able to place an order and be able to pick it up in your brick-and-mortar store.
In short, successful business owners need to support the cross-channel customer journey. For example, by using beacon technology you can send a customer a discount or coupon when they’re in the proximity of your pizzeria. They can then use an app and make a food order with just one-click. Once they arrive, the food is waiting for them.
In ordering items other than food, there is one huge pain point for customers when they order something online. You can ease that pain by using payment data so that you can accept cross-channel returns. Instead of getting the run-around, a customer can return the product in-person and have the money placed back on their card instantly.
Finally, you can use payment data to make sure that your most in-demand items are always in stock. Even if they’re not in stock currently, you can have an in-store app that allows customers to purchase items in their preferred size or color.
2. Closes the Loop
Payment data has also been revolutionizing the entire payment infrastructure and advertising because it gives merchants the chance to track the purchase to the original source.
For example, if you’re that same pizzeria owner who used beacons to target returning customers, you used payment data to discover that the customer came to the site after reading a review on Yelp. You then notice that a bulk of your business comes from Yelp reviews. Instead of dumping money into Facebook, you would want to focus on Yelp instead by developing a
The lesson you learn is that instead of dumping money into Facebook, you would want to focus on Yelp instead by developing a local-mobile strategy.
3. Creates Personalized Customer Service
Personalized customer experiences aren’t a luxury anymore. It’s a necessity. This means that when a customer walks into your store, they’re recognized as a returning customer because of the credit card they’ve used in the past. This triggers a loyalty reward, such as a coupon, discount, or free shipping.
Thanks to tokenization, your customer’s data is stored securely. This means that they can verify the purchase with just one-click, or a biometric like a fingerprint or selfie. Besides the transaction being secure, it’s speeds-up the entire checkout process.
4. Preempting Search
Let’s say that you just purchased a charcoal grill at a local hardware store. You still need to purchase secondary purchases like coal, grilling utensils, and food. Because you purchased a grill, you start receiving ads or coupons for these secondary purchases. Possibly you will receive a 5 percent off your purchase from a local butcher.
This preempt search can be used to your advantage since you’re targeting customers that are either interested or in-need of your products.
5. Reduces Fraud
Finally, payment data can help reduce fraud – which is a major concern for both customers and business owners. By using payment data you have insights into the normal shopping behavior of your customers.
For example, if they never spend more than $500 at your business at one time then that’s a red flag. So is if the shipping or email address is different, then what information has been used previously for this customer? Answering these questions can give you a basis to increase revenue from this customer — and will also help you reduce fraud from being perpetrated against your customer.

Chipotle Restaurant Virus Strikes — Again?

It seems like food chain Chipotle cannot catch a break.
From an E. coli outbreak to its employees accusing it of wage theft and hackers stealing customer payment data from 2,250 location, Chipotle has been through the wringer over the past few years.
Early last year, PYMNTS reported on accusations Chipotle’s food had taken a turn for the worst — making its customers sick courtesy of E. coli. And it seems, accusations of food poisoning is rearing their ugly head again.
The company’s shares dropped more than five percent earlier this week following the news breaking of a norovirus popping up at a Sterling, Virginia-based Chipotle location. Customers reported severe symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, nausea and dehydration, and there were two hospitalizations between July 14 and July 17 of this year.
It has been confirmed to have been an isolated incident and the location is back up and running. Chipotle’s executive director of food safety, Jim Marsden, commented on the situation.
“The reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus,” said Marsden. “Norovirus does not come from our food supply, and it is safe to eat at Chipotle.”

Payments Views from Glenbrook Partners





Is Amazon Best-in-Class for Online Payments?
by Russ Jones on July 19, 2017
in Amazon, Amazon Payments, B2B, Big Data, Card Payments, ECommerce, Ecommerce Payments, Merchants, Prepaid, Russ Jones



Amazon.com is in the news all the time with its continued expansion of markets and fulfillment centers, its focus on innovation and long term R&D, and, recently, some very non-intuitive acquisitions. It’s easy to get swept up in their story. But when a company gets as big and powerful as Amazon has become, it’s helpful to step back and see what lessons can be learned. And, of course, we like to do that from a payments perspective.

A big part of Amazon’s success in payments is tied to its scale. Because of its size and the purchase volume it generates, it can negotiate — if not demand — the best rates from payment providers. And it’s scale justifies the development and deployment of features that would only be nice-to-have capabilities for many retailers. 
I just said something subtle. I differentiated between its size and its purchase volume. For most companies these are the same thing. A $2.5 billion merchant sells $2.5 billion worth of goods and reports $2.5 billion worth of revenue. Amazon reported 2016 revenue of $136 billion, but it originated a lot more purchase volume than that. 
Why is that? Because Amazon uses a marketplace model, its revenue is a combination of what it sells directly and service fees for what its marketplace merchants sell with Amazon’s help. In rough numbers think of third party marketplace merchants adding another 50% of purchase volume to the transactions Amazon processes. The total marketplace volume also doesn’t include the off-Amazon purchase volume that flows through Amazon Pay. That’s incremental as well. 
I would be surprised if Amazon didn’t negotiate with third parties from a position of $250 billion in payment volume. That extra purchase volume doesn’t just help drive down processing costs, it also helps Amazon optimize its machine learning algorithms for fighting online fraud. It’s a great model. 
From this, what other best-in-class payment techniques does Amazon use?
Reusable Payment Data
Scale also includes 300 million plus active accounts containing default payment data and default ship-to information. The first best-in-class observation is that this payment data is usable across all product lines and all ordering channels. Not just their marketplace, but everything from Amazon Fresh to Woot! It’s usable over Alexa for voice-driven commerce and its usable off-Amazon at Amazon Pay merchants. This seems like a “duh” observation; of course it should be done this way. But think about how many merchants have different, unrelated views of their customers. That’s why multi-channel is such a hot investment area right now. Because many, many merchants don’t have this integrated view.
Localized Payment Processing
For methods of payments, Amazon supports international general purpose cards all over the world – Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB, and UnionPay (credit card only). Most online merchants would support the first four on that list. The additional support for JCB and UnionPay gives Amazon broader payments support to reach global consumers no matter where they are. Payment method coverage matters.
And here’s the best part, and what I consider the second best-in-class observation. Amazon operates 14 worldwide sites and has in-region fulfillment centers for fast delivery to these markets. It does that for commerce reasons. But with a local presence comes the opportunity to process local orders locally instead of cross-border back to the United States. There are multiple benefits from this.
First, when processing locally, Amazon is only paying in-country interchange instead of cross-border fees and U.S. interchange. This a big win because the U.S. market has one of the highest domestic interchanges rates in the world. More importantly, local authorization rates are much higher than cross-border authorization rates. So not only are there more good transactions, they also cost less from Amazon’s perspective. 
The second win from local processing is that Amazon now has the ability to accept local forms of payment that are prevalent in the local market — cash on delivery (COD), cash on order (COO), domestic prepaid cards, domestic bank transfers, installment payments –– whatever is prevalent in the local market. Even domestic Amazon gift cards. These local forms of payment are critical for reaching the largest number of potential buyers that may not have access to an international, general purpose card. Or even have a bank account.
Top-Line Enablers
In our Payments Boot Camps we always talk about what motivates and drives users and providers of payment systems to take action. For consumers, it’s convenience and financial gain that most often cause them to change how they use payments. For merchants, it’s getting paid, selling more stuff, and saving some costs — in that order. So what payment techniques does Amazon use to sell more stuff?
Amazon Co-Brand Card
The Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card was the original enabler to drive more consumer spending on Amazon. What was originally 1% cash back every time card is used has been expanded to 2% cash back for use in select categories (restaurants, gas stations, drug stores), and more recently, 5% cash back for use on Amazon.com if you are a Prime member. That provides plenty of motivation for an Amazon buyer to prefer the Amazon co-brand card on Amazon.
General purpose co-brand cards are known top-line enablers. Not only do they provide more buying power to the customer, they also generate cash back that can only be used with the co-brand partner. These soft dollars make an Amazon purchase decision more obvious because the dollars can be used to offset the cost of the same item on Amazon compared to another retailer. From a best practices perspective, Amazon also does in-checkout-flow application, underwriting, and provisioning of the new card right into the buyers Amazon account. If the buyer is approved, the current purchase (not a future purpose!) can be completed with an Amazon Reward card.
Amazon Private Label Credit Card
The Amazon Prime Store Card is relatively new and has the same benefit to Amazon as the Amazon Rewards Card. This card is targeted at consumers that are more “down market” and may not qualify for the general purpose Amazon Reward Card. Amazon still wants to extend buying power to these customers, but this time it is Amazon-specific buying power as the card can only be used with an Amazon account.

Amazon has taken a page from Target’s playbook and offers 5% cash back (as a monthly statement credit) for Prime Members on any purchase made with the card. It also providers Amazon buyers with access to promotional financing – 6 months on $149 or more, 12 months on $599 or more, 24 months on select high-ticket purchases. Like the Amazon Reward Card there is an instant credit decision, plus the Amazon customer gets a $40 Amazon gift card on approval. This is not a general purpose card and Amazon does not pay interchange on its use. Any purchase that is financed with the Amazon Prime Store Card likely has very, very attractive economics to Amazon. Not just on the incremental payment transaction but probably on some part of the interest earned by the issuer of the card if the consumer revolves.
Amazon Corporate Credit Line
This is another variation of credit extension (net 55) to drive incremental sales. In the case of the Amazon Corporate Credit Line, the incremental sales comes from libraries, schools, government institutions, and large businesses. Small-to-medium size business also have the option to revolve their purchases. 
This is a good example of how support for payment methods can be segmented by buyer type. In addition to the credit facility, Amazon also supports the identification and linking of primary and secondary Amazon accounts so a business could have a single Amazon Corporate Credit Line that is accessible by multiple employees inside the company. Once again, providing buying power and spreading it across them maximum number of customers.
Amazon Gift Card
This closed loop, private label card is sold both in store at the gift card mall and sold online directly by Amazon. Amazon customers get 5% cash back on the first $100 load, and 2% cash back on all subsequent reloads for $100 or more from a debit card or a bank account. For customers that don’t qualify for Amazon’s various credit-oriented reward products, this is an attractive way to enjoy ongoing discounts from Amazon — further locking in the customer to buying on Amazon. 
From Amazon’s perspective, these are Amazon-specific funds being held by Amazon (in a pooled bank account) that have all sorts of wonderful characteristics. The Amazon Gift Card gives them access to the unbanked that can now use cash to obtain online Amazon spending power at the convenience store. It has the well-known gifting “overspend” characteristic when actually given as a gift. And it provides a handy way for Amazon to refund and reward customer without encountering any real-world transaction cost. More on this later. 
To illustrate how merchants can push this type of product for the maximum benefit, Amazon has an allowance program for minors based on the parents being able to auto-reload gift card balance for their kids. There is also a bulk order program for corporate customers, so the gifting effect can be amplified across the whole office or company. 
Pay with Points
Originally, Amazon’s Pay with Points enabled their own Amazon Reward Card customers to spend their reward points on Amazon. But in recent years, partnerships with AmEx, Chase, Citi, and Discover have extended this even further so that the billions of dollars in reward points tied up with four of largest credit card issuers in the U.S. can now be spent on Amazon. 
While not the only merchant with Pay with Points partnership, Amazon’s selection and scale make it an obvious choice for any cardholder that has a backlog of points they would like to use. It effectively lowers the perceived cost of goods while creating incremental sales and ongoing loyalty to Amazon. It’s hard to say what the private economics are to Amazon when the buyer pays with points.
Bottom Line Enhancements
Not all payment related are focused on incremental sales. Some are focused on reducing the payments cost basis for Amazon without driving incremental sales. 
Refund to Amazon Balance
One of the simpler techniques leverages the Amazon Gift Card. When a customer asks for a refund, Amazon will ask the customer whether they would like the purchase refunded back to the original method of payment or refunded back to their Amazon Balance for use on a future purchase. 
A refund back to the original method of payment has real world cost. Amazon would get the original interchange back, but would still have to pay transaction fees on that refund. A refund to Amazon Balance has no real-world transaction costs for Amazon — on the refund or on the next subsequent purchase that uses Gift Card Balance. 
Lowest Cost Debit Card Routing
Another cost reduction technique available in the U.S. market is to route the purchase across the lowest cost debit card network. By law in the U.S. (Regulation II) every debit card in the nation is required to have two unaffiliated routing paths back to the issuing bank. In practice, this typically means a Visa/Mastercard routing path and a non-Visa/Mastercard routing path.
For Amazon, they have negotiated PINless Debit network routing agreements with NYCE and STAR to complement the normal Visa and Mastercard routing paths. By default, Amazon will route purchases in the U.S. made with a debit card over the least expensive debit card network for that transaction. Amazon provides its customers with the ability to opt-out of that non-standard routing path, but I suspect not many have done so and likely have little understanding of debit network routing paths.  
Amazon Currency Converter
The Amazon Currency Converter is Amazon’s dynamic currency conversion offering that helps cross-border customers buying across markets lock in their actual cost without having to wait to see what the card networks set as the conversation rate when the transaction clears. In addition to helping the customer have some certainty about what a purchase costs, this offering also gives Amazon an opportunity to participate in the currency conversion revenue. This is likely not a revenue center inside the company, but perhaps helps offset some of the cross-border transaction cost on international orders. 
Reduced Checkout Friction 
Amazon has also given a lot of thought to techniques it can use to reduce friction inside of checkout and maximize the chances that the order successfully completes. 
The most obvious example of this is the original 1-Click checkout model that Amazon developed almost 20 years ago. This model draws on the idea that repeat customers have already established their default payment method, default shipment method, and default ship-to address. Instead of going through the normal checkout flow to review and validate every step, Amazon just provides the ability to buy with a single click. 
This is an obvious example of reducing checkout friction. But there are some other subtle techniques that Amazon uses in the checkout flow that speak to what they DO NOT DO when compared to perceived best practices in checkout. 
First, they don’t ask the customer for the CVN2 number off the back of the card. The CVN2 is used by many online merchants as another data point in the order acceptance risk assessment. “If you were the real cardholder, you would have the card, could read the CVN2 off the back, and could type or tap it into the checkout flow”. Whether or not that number matches what the issuer believes the number to be becomes part of the risk assessment. Amazon does not ask for the CVN2. Asking for this number is an enormous point of friction in the checkout flow, it contributes to cart abandonment, it’s not required in any way. Of course, their scale and data analytic smarts give them other ways that can risk manage online orders without having to resort to friction inside the checkout flow. 
Second, they do not do a real-time authorization inside the checkout flow. This is more of a philosophical point than anything else. Amazon’s belief is that most customers are good, and that good customers should not be burdened with processes designed to weed out occasional bad customers. So when a customer places an order there is no authorization delay, there is no “do not hit the back button” messaging, there is just a simple “thank you” message from Amazon to the customer. If it turns out the purchase can not be authorized, a good customer is delighted to go back to the Amazon account and update the card data on file. 
Inside the checkout, Amazon will also help customers split funding between a gift card balance and a secondary funding source in order to provide the full order funding. To make the checkout process as slippery as possible, Amazon also offers “Amazon Households” so that members of the same family can share credit cards and debit cards across linked Amazon Accounts.
Summary
Our analysis shows that are many payment techniques used by Amazon that could be considered best-in-class. Others are doing interesting things as well, but Amazon.com is a great example of a global online merchant hitting on all cylinders in their approach to payments. The key takeaways for us are:

Use a global approach, but localize it for key markets if possible
Maximize payment alternatives to expand market coverages
Focus on cash back and savings – make it financially rewarding for customers
Look for opportunities to trim cost  – but transparently and not at the cost of impacting top-line sales
Focus on reducing purchase friction – make it convenient for a customer to buy

Dow Jones Customer Data Exposed: Personal Information, Payment Data Was Available Online

 Technology  Dow Jones Customer Data Exposed: Personal Information, Payment Data Was Available Online By  AJ Dellinger    On 07/17/17 AT 12:46 PM        CloseDow Jones and Company, publisher of the Wall Street Journal,  exposed sensitive personal and financial details of millions of its company’s customers, including Wall Street Journal subscribers.According to a  report from cybersecurity firm UpGuard, a misconfigured server containing customer data allowed “semi-public access” to as many as four million accounts. Dow Jones has confirmed at least 2.2 million customers were affected.Read:  Verizon Data Leak: 14 Million Customers Records ExposedAccording to UpGuard, the exposed data includes names, addresses, account information, email addresses, and last four digits of credit card numbers. An additional 1.6 million entries from the Dow Jones Risk and Compliance database—a subscription-based corporate intelligence program used by financial institutions—were also exposed.Steve Severinghaus, the Director of Editorial Communications at Dow Jones, emphasized to International Business Time that no full credit card or login information “that could pose a significant risk for consumers or require notification” was included in the exposure. He also said information from the Risk and Compliance database did not contain any customer information.Severinghaus, who described the situation as “data over-exposure, not a leak” said the content was exposed via Amazon cloud and “not the open internet.”    Newsweek is hosting a Structure Security event Sept. 26-27 in San Francisco.  Photo: Newsweek Media Group  UpGuard reported the exposed data was found on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) repository that was configured to allow any “authenticated” AWS users to download the data from the URL where it was hosted. There are over one million authenticated AWS users and registration for an account is free.Read:  Voter Registration Data Breach: Unsecure Server Leaves Info On Nearly 200 Million Americans ExposedWhile UpGuard did not disclose when it informed Dow Jones of the database issue, the company first discovered May 30 and accessed June 1. Nearly a month and a half later, the exposure was disclosed to customers.UpGuard called Dow Jones’ response to the exposure “sluggish” and called the company’s response “of great concern,” noting how important it is for companies to inform customers so they can secure their information and mitigate the possibility of a malicious attacker targeting their accounts.Severinghaus noted the exposure was the result of an internal error, not a hack or cyberattack, and was addressed quickly. “We immediately secured the data once we became aware of the problem,” Severinghaus said. “We take the security of Dow Jones information very seriously.”The Dow Jones exposure is just the latest case of customer records potentially being exposed because of a misconfigured Amazon server. Earlier this month  14 million customer records from Verizon, including account PINs, were exposed by a third-party company. Personal information of more than  three million WWE wrestling fans was also found exposed online in a server this month.Earlier this year nearly  200 million voter registration files that could be used to identify American voters were discovered on an unsecured Amazon server owned by Republican data analytics firm Deep Root Analytics. The database contained voter names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers and voter registration details including party affiliation. The data sets also listed voter ethnicity and religion.​

Commerce Signals Raises $12 Million in Funding Round Led by Stage 1 Ventures | Business Wire
























































Commerce Signals Raises $12 Million in Funding Round Led by Stage 1 
      Ventures






July 17, 2017 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Commerce 
      Signals, a privacy centric platform that connects advertisers and 
      publishers to insights from retail payment data, today announced that it 
      has closed an additional $12 million in Series B funding. The equity 
      round, led by Stage 1 Ventures with participation from institutional 
      investors, will allow Commerce Signals to expand its products, 
      partnerships, and geographies.
    


      Commerce Signals’ secure platform holds no data, but rather allows 
      advertisers to access aggregate transaction insights from approximately 
      70 percent of U.S. card-based purchases in near-real-time. In addition 
      to card-based transaction data, Commerce Signals has also added location 
      and payment panel data to its solution, which gives advertisers a 
      holistic picture of the consumer journey – from the time an ad is seen 
      to the time a purchase is made. With the insights available from 
      Commerce Signals, it’s possible to measure how different tactics are 
      performing, and optimize those tactics based on actual sales response.
    

      “Banks and other financial institutions have a vast amount of 
      transaction data, which can be hugely valuable to advertisers,” said 
      David Baum, managing director of Stage 1 Ventures. “In the past, 
      advertisers and publishers haven’t been able to access insights from 
      this data because of privacy and regulatory concerns. We’ve again 
      invested in Commerce Signals because it’s the only company that has 
      found a way to facilitate this data transaction in a way that is 
      completely compliant, leaving all of the data in control of the banks 
      and institutions but allowing advertiser and publishers to access the 
      valuable sales insights.”
    

      “The continued trend towards real sales accountability for marketing 
      spend, and our ability to help marketers optimize their campaigns based 
      on sales insights, is driving unprecedented demand from some of the 
      largest US retailers,” said Tom Noyes, CEO, Commerce Signals. “Over the 
      past year Commerce Signals has grown exponentially; this funding will 
      allow us expand the products that help our clients improve marketing 
      performance.”
    

      Commerce Signals currently works with over 20 publishers, including 
      previously announced partnerships with Barometric, 
      LiveRamp 
      and AdTheorent, 
      making sales measurement and real-time optimization more easily and 
      quickly accessible to digital advertiser and publishers.
    

About Commerce Signals


      Commerce Signals connects advertisers and publishers directly with 
      near-real-time insights from payment transaction data. The company's 
      platform, databridge™ delivers value beyond the payment transaction, 
      while giving data owners control of the use and price. Advertisers, 
      agencies and publishers focused on the retail, restaurants, casual 
      dining, hospitality, travel or entertainment industries can use insights 
      derived from the data to optimize media tactics and measure the 
      incremental cross-channel sales driven by their advertising. For more

Greg Kesich: If we let people die when it’s time, health care may cost a lot less

My father wanted simple, cheaper treatment at age 91, but the medical system pursued the wrong amount of care. 








By Greg KesichEditorial Page Editor

Read Article 


One morning five years ago, my 91-year-old father took a hard fall on a tile floor. In less than a week, he was dead.
It was not a surprise. He had an abnormally slow heart rate and had just been accepted to a hospice program, where his treatment was supposed to be limited to keeping him comfortable at the end of his life.

But even under those circumstances, it’s still amazing to me how hard it is to die and how much of our medical system is devoted to prolonging the inevitable.
During another national debate about health care and how to pay for it, I can’t stop thinking about my father’s last trip through the system. While millions of Americans get sick and die without even basic care, he spent his last year refusing services, not always with success.
He was twice dragged to the hospital even though he had signed a “Do Not Hospitalize” order. On one of those trips, he refused emergency surgery to get a pacemaker installed, saying that he didn’t want to do anything until he could talk with his doctor. After the consultation, he refused the operation again.
If he had said yes, he might be alive today. But would the device that made his heart beat regularly also have brought back his hearing, the loss of which had made normal conversation impossible? Would it have made the pain in his back go away? Would he still have desperately missed my mother, who had died six years earlier?

Would the people in the nursing home – where he would almost certainly have to be living – been able to understand his thick Eastern European accent better than the EMTs who took him to the hospital when he didn’t want to go?
Or would he have been a sad, isolated guy in a lot of pain, albeit one who had a regular heartbeat?
I’ve heard worse stories: Bedridden elders who are shocked back to life and attached to a ventilator, even though they have living wills. Or people with only months to live suffering through a colonoscopy even though they would have been too weak to survive surgery if the test had found a tumor.
I don’t know what the right amount of health care is, but I do know that in this country we make sure people get the wrong amount of care in more ways than one.
Whether you get too much care or not enough depends on a lot of things that have nothing to do with how sick you are.
How much money you have matters. How old you are matters. And weirdly, geography matters, too.
Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School have been compiling Medicare payment data for decades, and have been able to compare how conditions are treated in different places. They publish the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, available online, which shows that there are significant differences in the kind of treatment you receive depending on where you live.
For instance, southern Maine hospitals install pacemakers for people on Medicare at about the national average rate, 4.5 per 1,000 enrollees. They are used nearly twice as often in Lafayette, Louisiana (8.4 per thousand), and half as often in Dubuque, Iowa (2.2 per thousand).
The atlas shows it’s not just pacemakers that pop up at different rates in different places. Heart specialists are not evenly distributed around the country, either, and the places with the most doctors are also the ones where the most tests are ordered and procedures performed.
That’s not a response to real-world need. Doctors don’t usually move to the places where they think they’ll find the most disease. They go where they can make a living and tend to settle where they trained, working with local physicians who have a preferred approach. It’s the culture of the hospital near you – not just your specific illness – that will determine what kind of care you get and the size of your bill.
So, is installing pacemakers at about the national average something to celebrate? Or do they do it right in Dubuque and we’re pacemaker-happy in Maine? Or is it Lafayette where they know what’s going on and we’re way behind?
I don’t know, but I do know this: At the age of 91, it would have been far easier for my father to accept much more care than he needed – all covered by Medicare – than it was for him to get the much less expensive treatment he wanted. Meanwhile, 14,000 children in this state have no health insurance and won’t see a doctor unless they have an accident or disease serious enough to land them in an emergency room.
If you’re wondering why Americans pay more for health care than any of our industrialized peers and get worse outcomes, you don’t have to look much further than that.

                    The breach affected 14 Trump hotel properties
                

US President Donald Trump's hotel chain has been hit by its third data breach in as many years.Card payment data and security codes for reservations were accessed at 14 properties when the central reservation system at Sabre Corp, a third party, was breached.The attack has affected other travel companies working with Sabre.In some cases, guests' names, emails, phone numbers and addresses were also obtained.The first unauthorised access during the latest breach was recorded on 10 August last year, and the last occurred on 9 March 2017, according to a notice about the breach on the Trump Hotels website



Trump Hotels has not said how many customers were affected.Two separate breaches have been made public since 2014. In one, seven Trump hotels were affected by malware targeting payments between May 2014 and June 2015. The other case was reported in 2016.It was a common criminal tactic to go after smaller third parties when targeting customer data at bigger brands, said security expert Rik Ferguson, at Trend Micro."Ultimately, it's the customers of Trump hotels that have been affected."Can you say that Trump's chain is without reproach? "Not really, it's part of your due diligence to ensure that your suppliers are of the same security standard."Mr Ferguson added that the stolen data, including personal information on customers, was sensitive and that similar caches were frequently traded in underground communities."It really illustrates the importance of learning a lesson from past breaches, which doesn't seem to be the case here," he told the BBC.

Trump Hotels joins Hard Rock, Loews and Four Seasons as victims of Sabre hospitality breach

July 13, 2017
Trump Hotels joins Hard Rock, Loews and Four Seasons as victims of Sabre hospitality breach



















From August 10, 2016 through March 9, 2017, an attacker had unauthorized access to Sabre Corporation's SynXis Central Reservations system.

Trump International Hotels Management is now the latest in a series of hotel and resort chain operators to inform customers that their card payment data was compromised due to a breach at third-party hospitality solutions provider Sabre Corporation.
Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos, Loews Hotels, and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts have also made such declarations over the last week, following the May 2017 announcement that an authorized attacker gained access to Sabre's Hospitality Solutions SynXis Central Reservations system, which handles bookings for the resorts. In all four of these cases, the hospitality company issued an online statement warning customers that reservations processed through SynXis from August 10, 2016 through March 9, 2017 were affected.
In their various statements, the hotels say Sabre contacted them about the incident on either June 5 or 6, 2017. A statement published by Loews Hotels said that compromised information included cardholder names, payment card numbers, and card expiration data and security code, and in some cases guest names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses and other information.
Trump Hotels' statement uses the same language from the Loews statement, nearly word for word, and lists 14 affected properties: Trump Central Park, Trump Chicago, Trump Doonbeg, Trump Doral, Trump Las Vegas, Trump Panama, Trump Soho, Trump Toronto, Trump Turnberry, Trump Vancouver, Trump Waikiki, Trump DC, Trump Rio De Janeiro and Albemarle Estate.
Various news outlets have reported that this is the third known data breach involving Trump hotels since 2014. In September 2016, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced that Trump International Hotels Management agreed to pay more than $500,000 in fines following the exposure of 70,000 credit card numbers resulting from several breaches.
"That this is the third breach in as many years for Trump Hotels demonstrates that hospitality industry is falling short when it comes to identifying which third parties pose the greatest risk," said Fred Kneip, CEO at cyber risk management company CyberGRX. "The methods companies use to assess, manage, and mitigate third-party cyber risk need to evolve along with the threats they face.”
Hard Rock has experienced a previous breach as well: In June 2016, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas  disclosed that customer payment data was stolen and used fraudulently after an attacker installed POS malware on its systems. The malware was active from Oct. 27, 2015 through March 21, 2016.
This time around, Hard Rock said that 11 of its hotels were victimized: Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi, Hard Rock Hotel Cancun, Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, Hard Rock Hotel Goa, Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Las Vegas, Hard Rock Hotel Palm Springs, Hard Rock Hotel Panama Megapolis, Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Punta Cana, Hard Rock Hotel Rivera Maya, Hard Rock Hotel San Diego and Hard Rock Hotel Vallarta.
Loews cited 21 impacted properties: Beach House Suites by The Don CeSar, Hotel 1000, Loews Annapolis Hotel, Loews Atlanta Hotel, Loews Boston Hotel, Loews Chicago Hotel, Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel, Loews Coronado Bay Resort, Loews Don CeSar Hotel, Loews Hollywood Hotel, Loews Hotel Vogue, Loews Madison Hotel, Loews Miami Beach Hotel, Loews Minneapolis Hotel, Loews New Orleans Hotel, Loews Philadelphia Hotel, Loews Regency New York Hotel, Loews Regency San Francisco Hotel, Loews Santa Monica Hotel, Loews Vanderbilt Hotel and Loews Ventana Canyon Resort.
The Four Seasons' online statement consists primarily of a letter provided by Sabre and does not list specific hotels or resorts hit by the breach.
The hotel chains also emphasized that their own systems were not breached in the attack. Only customers who made reservations via Sabre's service would have been impacted.
Michael Magrath, director of global regulations and standards at VASCO Data Security, said that there very well could be more announcements to come. "How widespread the Sabre breach was won't be known for several months. [These incidents] may just be the top of the iceberg," said Magrath. "Cyber criminals continue to penetrate under secure systems, often targeting usernames and static passwords or compromising unsecure mobile applications."
It was also previously reported that the details of some Google employees were left exposed by the breach, after the search engine company's travel management company Wagonlit Travel was affected.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/27/2011
            

                BBB has determined that Payment Data Systems, Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the

Payment Data Systems, Inc., incorporated on June 4, 1998, is engaged in the business of processing electronic payments for other companies including a range of automated clearing house (ACH) processing, credit, prepaid card and debit card-based processing. The Company is an integrated payment solutions provider offering a range of services to merchants, billers, banks, service bureaus, and card issuers. The Company operates through two operating entities: Payment Data Systems, Inc. and FiCentive, Inc. Payment Data Systems, Inc. provides integrated electronic payment processing services to merchants and businesses, including credit and debit card-based processing services and transaction processing through the ACH network. The Company's ACH processing services enable merchants or businesses to both disburse and collect funds electronically using e-checks to transfer funds instead of traditional paper checks. An e-check is an electronic debit to a bank checking account that is initiated at the point-of-sale, on the Internet, over the telephone, or through a bill payment sent through the mail, and e-checks are processed using the ACH network.The Company's card-based processing services enable merchants to process both traditional card-present (swipe) transactions, as well as card-not-present transactions. The Company's electronic payment processing may take place in a range of forms and situations. The Company's capabilities allow merchants to convert a paper check to an e-check or receive card authorization at the point-of-sale. It also allows its merchants' respective customer service representatives to take e-check or card payments from their consumers by telephone, and enable their consumers to make e-check or card payments directly through the use of a Website or by calling a voice response telephone system. In addition, it operates an online payment processing service, under the domain name www.billx.com system, which allows consumers to process online payments to pay any other individual, including family and friends.The Company provides prepaid card processing services for merchants and consumers through its subsidiary, FiCentive, Inc. The Company offers MasterCard prepaid cards branded with its customers' corporation logos or trademarks. The Company creates, manages and processes prepaid card programs for corporate clients. These prepaid cards can be used for various applications, including payroll, corporate incentives, employee incentives and general use. The Company offers prepaid cards directly to consumers for use as a tool to stay on budget, manage allowances and share money with family and friends, and businesses use the Akimbo platform to deliver a range of payments from rewards and incentives to regular payroll. The Company offers the Akimbo MasterCard program.The Company has designed and implemented its integrated payment systems to function as gateways between its customers and its third party processing providers. The Company's systems provide for interfaces with its customers, through which payment data is captured electronically and transferred through the connections it has with its processing providers. The Company's systems also provide a data warehousing capability. It outsources its ACH transaction processing and card-based transaction processing to third party providers.The components of the Company's service offerings include all forms of ACH transaction processing, such as Represented Check, which is a consumer non-sufficient funds check that is presented for payment electronically rather than through the paper check collection system, and Accounts Receivable Check Conversion, which is a consumer paper check payment that is converted into an e-check. The Company's customers can initiate ACH transactions directly using an online terminal accessible through a Website or the Company can initiate ACH transactions on their behalf. Its service offering also includes merchant account services for the processing of card-based transactions through the VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB networks, including online terminal services accessed through a Website or retail services accessed through a physical terminal. The Company offers a Web-based customer service application that combines both ACH and card processing capabilities that allow companies to process one-time and recurring payments through e-checks or credit cards at the request of their consumers. In addition, it offers a Voice Response telephone system to companies that accept payments directly from consumers over the telephone using e-checks or credit cards.The Company offers e-check verification technology, which helps merchants prevent returns before processing and reduces return check transactions. The service utilizes the Company's returns database that contains records for any transaction that the Company has previously attempted to process and the transaction was unsuccessful for account closed, invalid account, non-sufficient funds, payment stopped, frozen account, unauthorized account and others. Merchants are allowed to query the database in advance of submitting a transaction for processing and settlement. Merchants utilize the data to make their own determination if they wish to process a payment or not.The consumers subscribe to the payment service at www.billx.com and are allowed to make a certain number of payments each month. The Company sells the payment portal service as a private label solution to online financial services providers looking to provide online bill payment capabilities as part of their service offering to consumers. The Company also offers the service to other debit card issuers, as the Company is able to utilize the bill payment component of the service for payments made through debit cards.The Company competes with First Data Merchant Services Corporation, Elavon Inc. and Vantiv, Inc.
