Comprehensive Plans


                Plans & Coverage            

Comprehensive Plans

Comprehensive travel insurance plans are the most widely known form of coverage with the most trip protection coverage available for a single trip. Typically, a comprehensive plan will offer a variety of benefits for travelers, covering a wide range of concerns, such as trip cancellation and going home early, flight delay, baggage loss or damage, 24-hour assistance and some travel medical coverage.
These the most widely known travel insurance plans because they are available for nearly any type of trip for travelers of any age.





Coverage Limits
Coverage limits for comprehensive travel insurance vary between plans and dictate the maximum amount of reimbursement in case of a claim. Typically, trip cancellation and trip interruption limits directly reflect your total trip cost. Other limits, such as medical, baggage and travel delay coverage are independent of this.
Several plans also have optional benefits that can tailor coverage to your specific trip needs. For example, if you’re traveling with business or sports equipment, you may want to compare comprehensive plans that offer coverage options for these items. If you are particularly concerned about illness or injury while traveling, you may want to compare plans with more travel medical or evacuation coverage. Also, several plans offer pre-existing condition waivers, if purchased within a specific time window. These options, often available with comprehensive plans, help to allow you to find the right plan for your trip.
Plan Exclusions
Most travel insurance plans will include a list of exclusions (such as events and items) that are not covered under the listed benefits. It’s always advisable to make sure you are well acquainted with the terms of any plan you are considering. This may help you feel more comfortable that the coverage you do buy will meet your needs and help to avoid issues in the event you file a claim.
Some exclusions can include travel delays that do not meet the required minimum or expensive sports equipment needed for your trip. Also, many plans will exclude pre-existing conditions or adventure activities from medical coverage.
Another popular coverage is trip cancellation. Many plans only provide coverage for a specific list of covered reasons for cancellation. We recommend reviewing this list to be fully aware of which reasons are included and which are not. This can help you to prepare for a claims process, if necessary.

Question:
    What does waiver of pre-existing condition mean?  I plan to travel on Sept 20 to Europe. I was born on 07 Oct 1941. I have pre-existing health conditions but have been controlled for several years.  I plan to get a comprehensive travel insurance.    
LuzvismindaG, 
 
06/07/2017





Answer:  Most Comprehensive Plans will offer a waiver of pre-existing conditions if you meet the following conditions: You purchase the policy within 10 to 21 days of making your first trip payment; insure ALL prepaid non-refundable expenses prior to your departure date; and be medically fit to travel the day you purchase the policy.  If the reason you are canceling, interrupting or seeking medical coverage is related to pre-existing conditions there will be no coverage, unless you have the waiver.  A Pre-Existing Condition is any treatment, diagnostic tests or exams, any recommendations for diagnostic test or exams, or any adjustments in medication up or down within the pre-existing condition period stated (depending on the company, 60 – 180 days prior to the effective date).

Question:
    If we purchased a tour package and before or during the trip one of our parents or a relative becomes  very ill (or dies) and we have to cancel our trip or  return home early what will travel insurance cover?    
LydiaV, 
 
05/29/2017





Answer:  The number one covered reason for Trip Cancellation and Trip Interruption is the unforeseen illness or injury of you or a traveling companion that deems you unfit to travel, by order of a licensed physician; or the unforeseen hospitalization or death of a family member.  To see all of the covered reasons to cancel or interrupt your trip, please click on the dollar amount that appears under the words "Trip Cancellation" when viewing a quote.  If you had to cancel the trip for a covered reason, you are reimbursed 100%.  If you had to interrupt the trip for a covered reason, you are reimbursed the unused portion of your trip cost depending when the trip is interrupted.

Question:
    My wife and I are traveling to Orlando, FL July 1-8 to attend grandson's baseball team tournament play.  The airfare will be booked by us while the rooms at Disney are being booked by the team and we will have to reimburse them for that cost.  Will trip insurance cover that portion of the trip if it is not paid directly to Disney by us?    
Bryon, 
 
05/17/2017





Answer:  Yes, as long as you can prove that you reimbursed the travel supplier for the cost of the accommodations, you can insure that travel arrangement provided that it is prepaid and non-refundable.

Question:
    We travel several times each year to various places and don't have a lot of equipment, etc.  Mainly just want a policy that will cover major medical situations for the whole year, just in case, since we are 62 years old (although we are healthy and active now).  Is it better to buy a separate evac policy?  Is there a good option that we have not thought of?    
Trisha, 
 
03/18/2017





Answer:  We do provide annual medical policies for trips that take place outside of your home country.  Typically, the trips cannot be longer than 90 days per trip with most plans.

To obtain a quote, please fill out the quote form with your very first trip's details and once you arrive on the results page, please select the medical tab and view our plans that are labeled “multi trip".  Our multi-trip medical plans provide both medical and medical evacuation coverage.  You do not need to buy a separate evacuation policy unless you wanted the extra coverage.

Question:
    Is there a policy that covers the land tour plan which is purchased separate from the flight portion? Also can you purchase the cancel for any reason when making deposits on land portion of trip and just today purchased flight portion.    
KayS, 
 
02/15/2017





Answer:  All of our comprehensive plans will cover a prepaid non-refundable land tour even if it was purchased separate from the airfare.  There are 3 conditions that must be met to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason Rider as follows: Purchase the policy within 10 - 21 days of First Trip Payment; Insure ALL prepaid and non-refundable travel expenses prior to departure; Trip arrangements must be canceled more than 48 -72 hours prior to the departure date.  If you meet all 3 of these conditions, most of the policies will reimburse you 75% of your trip costs, unless otherwise noted.

Question:
    Going on a cruise as a single person.  each paying half of the cost of the stateroom. and one cancels the trip.  How would the other person be guaranteed the same room without paying the others cost.  For instance I pay 2,000 and my roomate pays 2,000. and she cancels.  I would like to still keep the same room and not pay her share.    
Anita, 
 
11/14/2016





Answer:  When viewing quotes, please click on the amount listed under Trip Cancellation to view the covered reasons for Trip Cancellation.  In this window that opens up, most policies will include wording regarding Single Supplement Coverage.  Please see below:

Single Supplement

Benefits will be paid, up to the Maximum Benefit Amount, for the additional cost incurred as a result of a change in the per person occupancy rate for Prepaid Travel Arrangements if a Traveling Companion’s or Family Member’s Trip is canceled for a covered reason and You do not cancel Your Trip.

These benefits will not duplicate any other benefits payable under the Policy or any coverage(s) attached to the Policy. 

Please keep in mind, benefits can be state specific and the wording can vary depending on where you reside.

Question:
    1)  what are "covered reasons" for CFAR policies?

2)  i'm approaching the 14 day timeframe to purchase CFAR policy.  Are there any other options available?    
PB, 
 
04/29/2014





Answer:  Cancel for any reason does not use covered reasons. The CFAR benefit lets you change your mind about the trip, doesn't matter what for. And yes, there are other plans that allow 21 days for cancel for any reason. If you get a quote on our website, there will be a filter available to only show the options with cancel for any reason.

Insuring Your Trip


                Insuring Your Cruise            

Insuring Your Cruise


Cruise insurance is especially important because of the unique multi leg nature of traveling by cruise ship. Depending on the specific policy, cruise travel insurance can protect you if you miss a leg of your trip, or have an emergency evacuation from sea. When abroad by ship, cruise trip insurance can cover you for unexpected medical issues. We invite you to look through our online app for a personalized cruise insurance comparison. If you are primarily interested in medical coverage, please read more about our travel health insurance plans we have available.
However, it's important to be cautious about where you get that travel insurance for a cruise. Typically, to find the best cruise insurance it's most advisable to look at cruise insurance reviews and then buy travel insurance for your cruise from a third party source — not from the cruise line itself or from a booking site. These types of travel insurance plans tend to be fairly limited in their coverage, may not contain important benefits you need for your individual comfort and safety, and are often written in a way that is more likely to benefit the cruise line than it is to benefit you. Whenever you purchase Travel insurance for a cruise, make sure to find out what type of coverage is available to you for the following concerns:
Medical Care
If you should unexpectedly fall ill or become injured while you're on your cruise, you'll need some sort of medical insurance coverage to offset the expense of the medical care you receive. Many cruisers don't know that their home medical insurance provider may not cover any care they receive outside of their home country (some may cover only a portion of the costs). Those on Medicare should be particularly concerned with this type of benefit, as Medicare does not traditionally cover any kind of medical care outside of the United States.
Emergency Medical Evacuation
While rare, emergency medical evacuations are a very real possibility for cruisers. Whether the emergency is severe enough to require an air rescue from the ship, or whether it involves emergency transport from the nearest port-of-call, the costs can be extensive if not covered by insurance. Travelers who are particularly concerned about the possible quality of medical care in an unknown area of the world may want to consider looking into the optional Hospital of Choice benefit, as well.
Baggage Loss or Baggage Delay
Between airlines, ships and ports-of-call, there are plenty of opportunities for cruisers to misplace personal items — or for those personal items to be delayed, lost in transit or stolen. Baggage loss coverage to help recover the costs of replacing lost items, or baggage delay coverage to help get the necessities covered while waiting for bags, can greatly decrease the stress of losing your belongings.
Identity Theft
Losing personal documents, such as passports, is certainly a possibility when on a cruise. Identity theft protection is a unique service offered by some travel insurance companies, which can help guide you through the process of minimizing any possible damage to your credit or financial reputation. It can also assist in important communications and monitoring to help replace your documents as quickly as possible.
Financial Default
One important benefit that third-party insurance plans offer is possible coverage for financial default. In other words, if your cruise line or another travel supplier related to your cruise goes bankrupt, financial default coverage would allow you to potentially recover the money paid to that travel supplier. However, financial default coverage is a time-sensitive benefit, so be sure to look into purchasing your travel insurance as soon after you make your first trip payment.
Hurricanes and other Bad Weather
Cruise ships are obviously especially vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes or other severe weather. While most travel insurance plans will not offer coverage if your cruise goes off as scheduled, it may cover you if the cruise is cancelled or cut short. Cruise cancellation insurance can help to recoup any costs that the cruise company will not reimburse. Some plans specifically built for cruises do have coverage for itinerary changes or excursion cancellation due to weather conditions. There are also important travel insurance benefits available that are related to bad weather that occurs at your home, such as trip interruption coverage.

Question:

ElissaR,

Answer:  You can purchase one policy to cover your entire trip and you can insure all prepaid non-refundable travel arrangements, including the cruise.  For the destination, we only ask to list the country where you are spending the most of your time, or you can list the country you fly to where the cruise begins.

Question:
    My Neice  WANTs TO BOOK A CRUISE, BUT her FATHER IS ON A LIST FOR HIP SURGERY IN CANADA. He is not taking the cruise, but she is a nurse and will have to take care of him.  We don't know when the surgery will be as with the Canadian health system we have to wait for a call when space is available.  Can she get a full refund for the cruise if this should happen the week of my cruise and I can't go.    
Michelle, 
 
04/06/2017





Answer:  For this type of concern, you would need Cancel for Any Reason as this is considered foreseen.
There are 3 conditions that must be met to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason Rider as follows: Purchase the policy within 10 - 21 days of First Trip Payment; Insure ALL prepaid and non-refundable travel expenses prior to departure; Trip arrangements must be canceled more than 48 -72 hours prior to the departure date.  If you meet all 3 of these conditions, most of the policies will reimburse you 75% of your trip costs, unless otherwise noted.

Answer:  You can purchase most policies up until the day before departure, however; you may not be eligible for some time sensitive benefits if you do not purchase within 10-30 days of the initial trip deposit/payment.  Some time sensitive benefits are, but not limited to: Pre-Existing Condition Waiver, Financial Default, Terrorism, Cancel For Any Reason and Cancel For Work Reasons.

Answer:  Any comprehensive plan will provide coverage for your upcoming cruise trip.  We also have specific cruise policies through Nationwide which may be available depending on the cruise line you are cruising with.  You can purchase most policies up until the day before departure, however; you may not be eligible for some time sensitive benefits if you do not purchase within 10-30 days of the initial trip deposit/payment.  Some time sensitive benefits are, but not limited to: Pre-Existing Condition Waiver, Financial Default, Terrorism, Cancel For Any Reason and Cancel For Work Reasons.

    We plan a 12 day cruise with stays in different ciites before and after the cruise.   Is the land with flights and cruise covered based on total cost?  Do any of your policiies include missed connection while on the cruise, e.g., in one port the bus or train we took to town has an accident and the boat sails without us.  thank you    
KarenH, 
 
02/17/2017





Answer:  Unfortunately, that is not something that is covered with travel insurance.  Missed Connection benefits offer coverage in the event you miss a cruise or tour departure because of a common carrier delay resulting from inclement weather or other specified reasons.

Answer:  No, if you just return to the ship late this would not be covered. Only in the event that a covered reason for trip interruption occurs and causes you to miss portions of the covered trip would there be coverage to get caught up.

Question:
    If you arrange your own air using miles, what's the best way to protect yourself against fees for redepositing/changing?  Cost of the trip is not in dollars, but miles and fees.    
Melody, 
 
02/07/2014





Answer:  Airline miles are not generally considered an insurable cost. The fees and taxes you pay to use them can be insured for, and certain companies will also allow you to insure the cost of re-banking or re-depositing fees. There is also one company - Travel Insured - who will allow you to insure the value of the tickets, as long as the airline does NOT allow you to re-bank the miles.

Question:
    When requesting a quote, does it matter if the trip starts in America but makes a stop in Mexico.  Example,  flying from Denver to LA.  Then taking a cruise that stops in Mexico.  Would I list Cont. United States or international when requesting a quote.    
Scott, 
 
01/15/2014





Answer:  The destination is whichever country you will be spending the most time in during your trip. If you'll be visiting several destinations equally (or spending most of it on a cruise ship) then list the country where your trip begins. You will still be covered while traveling outside of the selected country, so long as you are not visiting a destination that is considered restricted. If a policy does consider certain destinations restricted, you can find this list in the terms and conditions section.

                Hard to rate satisfaction with a product we didn't use but the InsureMyTrip website is convenient and easy to use.  Any phone contact I have ever had with them has been professional and productive.

                I did not file a claim. When I had questions about the policy before purchase the sales rep did a good job explaining everything to me. I did feel it was worth the expense since both my husband and I have elderly parents. Had something happened, we would have been covered.

                Purchasing the plan gave us piece of mind.  You actually hope you never need it and in our case, we didn't.  But when traveling so far from home and for such a long period on your own (no tours), there was comfort in knowing we had something to fall back on at a reasonable cost.            
 Jose S.                would

                I would use this company again because it was easy to see what they offered and compare it to other company plans.  It is always difficult with insurance to know exactly what is covered until you actually need the insurance; however, I downloaded the paperwork and took it with me in case we needed anything.  Fortunately, so fortunately, we did not need any coverage; however, it is essential to have it.            
 Peter V.                would 
                recommend this plan to a friend or relative.

                This was expensive insurance, but it was a high cost trip as it was for a month and in the UK. I was injured prior to the trip and unable to travel. There was A LOT of paper work and I would advise you to be sure to keep excellent record keeping in case you have to file a claim. You will also have to wait if you are renting an accommodation like I was, to see if they can re-rent it before you file your claim to determine if you have any credit. Similarly if you have airline tickets and cancel you may only get taxes paid back so you will need documentation of all of that before filing a claim! Just an FYI.
Everyone I spoke to from the start in customer service about filing the claim was very personable and helpful. Once submitted it did take about a week longer than it stated based on the fact that they were " backed up" however once processed I received the full refund within 48hrs of notification. If I hadn't taken out the insurance I would have lost a lot of money so I would highly recommend buying a comprehensive insurance such as this from C & F Travel Insured International , especially if your trip is oversees.            
 Ruth M.                would 
                recommend this plan to a friend or relative.

                Our Guarantees            

InsureMyTrip Guarantees
We don't just say we'll get it right for you — we make sure of it. Our guarantees cover the products we sell, the quality you expect, and the accuracy you deserve.





Best Plans Guarantee
Don't love the plan, we don't keep it.

Our Customer Ratings and Reviews forum allows travelers to tell us what they think about products. If an insurance plan or provider receives less than the 4-star minimum standard rating, we will remove them from our site. In other words, your feedback filters the products we offer keeping only the best quality plans. So don't hold back. Tell us what you really think.
How it works:
New plans/providers will be given a 6-month grace period to accumulate reviews and must have at least 10 reviews on the site before being subject to the terms of this guarantee. 





Price Guarantee
You won't find the same plan cheaper.

Providing discounts or any other "funny business" with regards to travel insurance pricing is illegal. We're already offering the best plans at state-regulated prices. Our Price Guarantee means that no other reputable site can offer the same plan at a better price. 





Money Back Guarantee
Not happy? Cancel during the review period and get your money back.

When you buy from our site, you should be sure you have chosen the right plan for your trip. If you're not, simply cancel it for a refund. Each provider and plan are unique so check your certificate of insurance to find your cancellation and refund policy.

Terms and conditions vary by residence, provider and plan, and may include an administrative fee charged by the providers which may not be eligible for refund.

Allianz Global Assistance, a world leader in travel insurance and assistance services, can offer many reasons why millions of travelers protect themselves and their families with travel insurance.

Why Buy Travel Insurance For Your Cruise? Allianz Global Assistance, a world leader in travel insurance and assistance services, can offer many reasons why millions of travelers protect themselves and their families with travel insurance. They're the people we help every year through unanticipated travel delays, missed cruise embarkations and medical emergencies in foreign countries.  Last Minute Cancellation- You've been planning your dream cruise for a year - and then you get sick the day before departure. Allianz Global Assistance's cruise travel insurance can insure for covered illness, injury and even losing your job, and can ensure you get back your nonrefundable costs. On-Board Medical Emergency- Ships' doctors aren't equipped to handle serious medical crises. If you suffer a serious covered health crisis while cruising, evacuation coverage can pay to transport you to the nearest appropriate medical facility. Missed Connection- If your flight gets delayed, the ship won't wait. Allianz Global Assistance can help you make new travel arrangements to catch up with your cruise ship and may reimburse you for those additional expenses. (You must, however, make a reasonable effort to minimize travel costs.) Trip Interruption- If you have to cut your cruise short for a covered reason, travel insurance may reimburse you for the part of the cruise you miss as well as your costs to return home early.                Allianz User Reviews             The next time you travel, make sure you're protected with Travel Insurance from Allianz Global Assistance.

Why Buy Travel Insurance For Your Flight? Allianz Global Assistance, a world leader in travel insurance and assistance services, can offer many reasons why millions of travelers protect themselves and their families with travel insurance. They're the people we help every year through unanticipated travel delays, bad weather, lost luggage and medical emergencies in foreign countries.  Travel Delays- If you're an experienced traveler, you know that sinking feeling you get when you miss your connecting flight due to a delay. Trip delay coverage can reimburse you for meals, accommodations and lost prepaid expenses if your trip is delayed more than six hours for a covered reason. Trip Cancellation- Let Allianz Travel Insurance help protect your trip investment by taking the worry out of unforeseen circumstances that could disrupt your plans.

A major competitor in the online travel agency industry, Orbitz.com was originally formed by a group of U.S. airlines in 1999. The Orbitz.com site went live online in 2001. Orbitz.com seeks to make it easy for travelers to find the perfect hotel, book the best flight, and reserve the right car, among other offerings. The online travel agency constantly updates its latest deals to destinations like New York and Las Vegas. 



The Good

Travel services
Mobile app
Rewards program
Travel protection

Travel Services
Orbitz is one of the leading providers in online travel booking. Its resources and technology help thousands of travelers each year to book vacations and take advantage of low rates on flights, hotels, rental cars, cruises, and other travel accommodations and activities.
Mobile App
Along with its simple website, Orbitz.com separates itself again from other competitors by not only having a mobile app for Apple and Android users. It also has a mobile app for Kindle Fire users which increases Orbitz.com's customer base.
Rewards Program
Orbitz offers a three-tier travel rewards program that allows customers to earn Orbucks, the company's own currency. Orbucks are earned when customers book travel for others, book using the Orbitz mobile app, or book a package.
Travel Protection
Orbitz offers travel insurance through Allianz Global Assistance, which provides added protection and gives customers peace of mind while traveling. Customers can choose to add travel protection upon booking or add it up until the day before departure.



The Bad

Limited booking options

Limited Booking Options
While Orbitz allows customers to book travel accommodations online, the company does not allow them to book over the phone or in-person. This can be frustrating for customers who are not comfortable booking online.



The Bottom Line
Orbitz offers several travel services, travel protection, a rewards program, and a mobile app. However, the company limits its booking options to online only.

Cheyenne

June 13th, 2015  Lithonia, GA
Around 6pm on June, 12th, 2015, a friend and I were attempting to book a trip to Cancun from Atlanta. The Orbitz website was having problems with a simple promo code. So we proceeded to conference call Orbitz to ask the question "Can we process this booking online and be given the money off from the promo code at a later time since to website isn't working?". The agent, Ross, refused to answer my question after asking it 3 times but insisted on processing our bookings herself.
Ross begins to work on my friend's trip at a snails rate. All the while still not answering my question. It took Ross 45 to process that first package. Orbitz states on their website the prices are subject to change. When it came time to book my package for 2 people, 45 minutes later, the price had jumped up $60. I explained to Ross that I should not have to pay that extra amount because had she of just answered my question the first 4 times I asked it, I would've finished my booking before the price hike. It took Ross another 30 minutes to completely my booking after which I asked for her name and asked to speak to a supervisor. We were on hold for 20 more minutes. Finally the supervisor comes to the phone, I explain to her the situation at hand from start to finish. The supervisor who's name I did not catch, proceeds to tell me that Orbitz can only offer me a $60 voucher. I asked her can that voucher be applied towards my trip, my checked bags, or anything useful. She tells me it can only be used towards a future trip and that Orbitz doesn't do refunds. I explain to her that you guys already proved inadequate with booking trips I have no reason to even want to use Orbitz services again. She offered to raise the voucher to $70 towards a future trip. I let her know I do not accept this offer and I want a partial refund. She says I'll make sure to put that in the note and hung up.
About 15 minutes my partner on the trip decides to call Orbitz and ask for a partial refund. In a one hour phone call he spoke to 3 different Orbitz employees. A random woman, Rex the supervisor, and Matthew the manager. After reiterating the situation each time, all 3 employees stated that Orbitz does not give refunds at all. Which I believe to be impossible that a multi-million dollar company like Orbitz is incapable of giving refunds to its customers who they have wronged. Matthew offered us an $80 voucher and refused to give us the number of his boss. Orbitz unwillingness to help its customers is astounding. It seems as though their entire staff has been trained that "There is nothing I can do to help fix this." is a viable answer to any problem at hand.
Of course I have every intention on going to Cancun and having the time of my life. What I refuse to accept is that I should have to come out of pocket for a lack of proper training on their employees side. It is not right.
The vast majority of Orbitz customers use their service to save money, while my savings were taken from me. Before dealing with Ross and the Orbitz website messing up, the total price for my vacation package would've been $1,522 after the promo code of $150 off the total price. What I ended up paying because of Ross was $1,582.57. That is $60 I was supposed to be saving and applying towards my vacation. My measly $60 is all I ask for.

This is what I get for stepping out on Priceline. Never cheat on a good thing.

Founded in 2001, Orbitz is a travel service that helps customers search, book, and manage their travel accommodations. The company has partnerships with many different airfare and travel providers and owns many of its own brands, which helps to increase the number of affordable fare options available to customers.



The Good

Resources
Features
Rewards program
Mobile app

Resources
As one of the leading providers of online travel bookings, Orbitz has created resources that help to make research and booking easy for travelers. The company provides aggregated data from thousands of sites to help travelers find the best values on vacations and stay on budget.
Features
In an attempt to make booking travel as easy as possible, Orbitz has developed a number of tools and features to benefit consumers during the planning process, including:

An easy-to-use navigation setup that lets customers easily compare different travel options
A rewarding incentives program for returning customers
A mobile app that customers can use to book services and check itineraries
Options for staying at the top resorts, including Disney and MGM

Rewards Program
Orbitz has a travel rewards program that allows members to earn Orbucks, which is the company's own currency. One Orbuck equals one USD in savings on qualifying hotel bookings. The rewards program has three levels:

Silver - Members receive 100 percent of the difference plus a bonus of up to 100 Orbucks
Gold - Members receive 100 percent of the difference plus a bonus of up to 150 Orbucks
Platinum - Members receive 100 percent of the difference plus a bonus of up to 200 Orbucks

Mobile App
Orbitz separates itself from competitors by not only providing a mobile app for Apple and Android users, but an app for Kindle Fire users as well.



The Bad

Privacy concerns
Reward limitations

Privacy Concerns
There are some concerns about Orbitz and its privacy standards. In the past, the company has shared customer data, including credit card information, with other businesses as is articulated in its terms of service. Some customers have even reported that they were charged as much as $12 for memberships in third-party travel rewards programs that they never intended to enroll in.
Reward Limitations
Although Orbtiz does have a rewards program, not all products or services can be used to earn Orbucks. The following accommodations are not eligible for rewards:

Non-qualifying hotels that are not prepaid
Activities and services
Car rentals
Cruises
Travel insurance

Consumers should also keep in mind that Orbucks earned through booking expire after 12 months, while promotional Orbucks will expire according the details listed in the promotional terms.



The Bottom Line
Orbitz provides a number of attractive features, including resources, a rewards program, and a mobile app. However, there are some limitations to the company's rewards program. Further, there are a few concerns about the company's privacy standards.

I've used Orbitz from time to time while planning trips and have not always had the best experience. A couple of years ago I needed to postpone a trip and they made it extremely difficult. I essentially lost $1,300 and they were very unapologetic. I won't be using them again, too many other options to pick a company who didn't mind losing a customer.

In Feb 2016 I booked a trip (flight and rental car) through Orbitz. While booking the rental car I kept getting an error on the website stating that they couldn't process the transaction and to try again, which I did and kept getting the error message. Come to find out that even though I was getting the error message the system was processing the booking thus I ended up with 6 rental car bookings. I called and customer service said that they had deleted all but one car booking. a couple weeks later I was looking at my credit card statement and saw that I was charge by Orbitz for two rental cars. When I called customer service they told me that it was the rental car problem not theirs. I disagree because it was Orbitz on the credit card statement, not the rental car company, and it was Orbitz that took the card for payment. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was hung up on. I called many times asking for a supervisor and only received argument or they would hang up on me. I even tried emailing several times and the response was you have an active car reservation. I called Capital One to see if they could help. They called Orbitz while I was on the line and Orbitz hung up on them too. Capital One said that they would try to work it out with Orbitz. I went on the trip April 3-10, when I went to pick up the rental car the person there asked me about the second reservation, I explained and he said no worries he thought it was a mistake. Then I received a message last night from Capital one that Orbitz gave them 'evidence' that the charge was correct. I don't know what that evidence can be. How can one person drive two cars? The vacation has past and Orbitz can contact Budget and they can verify that I only took one car. I was charged $226.35 for something I did not want nor booked. At the beginning of this nightmare, I just wanted my credit card credited back for $226.35. I have wasted a lot of time, energy and emotion in getting a wrong righted. It bothers me that a company I have used for years is treated me like this, it is criminal.

Insuring Your Trip


                Insuring Your Cruise            

Insuring Your Cruise


Cruise insurance is especially important because of the unique multi leg nature of traveling by cruise ship. Depending on the specific policy, cruise travel insurance can protect you if you miss a leg of your trip, or have an emergency evacuation from sea. When abroad by ship, cruise trip insurance can cover you for unexpected medical issues. We invite you to look through our online app for a personalized cruise insurance comparison. If you are primarily interested in medical coverage, please read more about our travel health insurance plans we have available.
However, it's important to be cautious about where you get that travel insurance for a cruise. Typically, to find the best cruise insurance it's most advisable to look at cruise insurance reviews and then buy travel insurance for your cruise from a third party source — not from the cruise line itself or from a booking site. These types of travel insurance plans tend to be fairly limited in their coverage, may not contain important benefits you need for your individual comfort and safety, and are often written in a way that is more likely to benefit the cruise line than it is to benefit you. Whenever you purchase Travel insurance for a cruise, make sure to find out what type of coverage is available to you for the following concerns:
Medical Care
If you should unexpectedly fall ill or become injured while you're on your cruise, you'll need some sort of medical insurance coverage to offset the expense of the medical care you receive. Many cruisers don't know that their home medical insurance provider may not cover any care they receive outside of their home country (some may cover only a portion of the costs). Those on Medicare should be particularly concerned with this type of benefit, as Medicare does not traditionally cover any kind of medical care outside of the United States.
Emergency Medical Evacuation
While rare, emergency medical evacuations are a very real possibility for cruisers. Whether the emergency is severe enough to require an air rescue from the ship, or whether it involves emergency transport from the nearest port-of-call, the costs can be extensive if not covered by insurance. Travelers who are particularly concerned about the possible quality of medical care in an unknown area of the world may want to consider looking into the optional Hospital of Choice benefit, as well.
Baggage Loss or Baggage Delay
Between airlines, ships and ports-of-call, there are plenty of opportunities for cruisers to misplace personal items — or for those personal items to be delayed, lost in transit or stolen. Baggage loss coverage to help recover the costs of replacing lost items, or baggage delay coverage to help get the necessities covered while waiting for bags, can greatly decrease the stress of losing your belongings.
Identity Theft
Losing personal documents, such as passports, is certainly a possibility when on a cruise. Identity theft protection is a unique service offered by some travel insurance companies, which can help guide you through the process of minimizing any possible damage to your credit or financial reputation. It can also assist in important communications and monitoring to help replace your documents as quickly as possible.
Financial Default
One important benefit that third-party insurance plans offer is possible coverage for financial default. In other words, if your cruise line or another travel supplier related to your cruise goes bankrupt, financial default coverage would allow you to potentially recover the money paid to that travel supplier. However, financial default coverage is a time-sensitive benefit, so be sure to look into purchasing your travel insurance as soon after you make your first trip payment.
Hurricanes and other Bad Weather
Cruise ships are obviously especially vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes or other severe weather. While most travel insurance plans will not offer coverage if your cruise goes off as scheduled, it may cover you if the cruise is cancelled or cut short. Cruise cancellation insurance can help to recoup any costs that the cruise company will not reimburse. Some plans specifically built for cruises do have coverage for itinerary changes or excursion cancellation due to weather conditions. There are also important travel insurance benefits available that are related to bad weather that occurs at your home, such as trip interruption coverage.

Question:
    I'm going on a 30 day European holiday which includes an 8 day cruise. Do I need to get separate insurance for the county's I'm visiting and the cruise?    
ElissaR, 
 
05/24/2017





Answer:  You can purchase one policy to cover your entire trip and you can insure all prepaid non-refundable travel arrangements, including the cruise.  For the destination, we only ask to list the country where you are spending the most of your time, or you can list the country you fly to where the cruise begins.

Question:
    My Neice  WANTs TO BOOK A CRUISE, BUT her FATHER IS ON A LIST FOR HIP SURGERY IN CANADA. He is not taking the cruise, but she is a nurse and will have to take care of him.  We don't know when the surgery will be as with the Canadian health system we have to wait for a call when space is available.  Can she get a full refund for the cruise if this should happen the week of my cruise and I can't go.    
Michelle, 
 
04/06/2017





Answer:  For this type of concern, you would need Cancel for Any Reason as this is considered foreseen.
There are 3 conditions that must be met to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason Rider as follows: Purchase the policy within 10 - 21 days of First Trip Payment; Insure ALL prepaid and non-refundable travel expenses prior to departure; Trip arrangements must be canceled more than 48 -72 hours prior to the departure date.  If you meet all 3 of these conditions, most of the policies will reimburse you 75% of your trip costs, unless otherwise noted.

Mary, 
 
03/18/2017





Answer:  You can purchase most policies up until the day before departure, however; you may not be eligible for some time sensitive benefits if you do not purchase within 10-30 days of the initial trip deposit/payment.  Some time sensitive benefits are, but not limited to: Pre-Existing Condition Waiver, Financial Default, Terrorism, Cancel For Any Reason and Cancel For Work Reasons.

Question:
    We are taking a cruise to Cuba but will only be there 1 1/2 days of a 5 day cruise.  The starting port of Tampa would be considered the main port, correct?  I have some health issues, if we had to cancel would our excursions off the ship be covered also?  We get our excursions from a third party.

Answer:  As long as the travel arrangements are prepaid and non-refundable, you can insure them.  It does not matter where the arrangements were purchased.

Question:
    We will be cruising in November but driving to the port .what's the best type of cruise insurance to purchase ?  Also would they insurance have to have purchased at the time of the first payment .    
jackieB, 
 
02/17/2017





Answer:  Any comprehensive plan will provide coverage for your upcoming cruise trip.  We also have specific cruise policies through Nationwide which may be available depending on the cruise line you are cruising with.  You can purchase most policies up until the day before departure, however; you may not be eligible for some time sensitive benefits if you do not purchase within 10-30 days of the initial trip deposit/payment.  Some time sensitive benefits are, but not limited to: Pre-Existing Condition Waiver, Financial Default, Terrorism, Cancel For Any Reason and Cancel For Work Reasons.

Question:
    We plan a 12 day cruise with stays in different ciites before and after the cruise.   Is the land with flights and cruise covered based on total cost?  Do any of your policiies include missed connection while on the cruise, e.g., in one port the bus or train we took to town has an accident and the boat sails without us.  thank you    
KarenH, 
 
02/17/2017





Answer:  Unfortunately, that is not something that is covered with travel insurance.  Missed Connection benefits offer coverage in the event you miss a cruise or tour departure because of a common carrier delay resulting from inclement weather or other specified reasons.

Question:
    Is having to go to university on "early admissions    ' status a sustainable reason for cancelation/interruption under your coverage.  University will not make admission decision until May, long after deadline for paying for cruise.    
Marilynn, 
 
02/09/2017





Answer:  Unfortunately, this is not something that is covered with Trip Cancellation.  We would recommend buying a policy that offers Cancel for Any Reason for that particular concern.

There are 3 conditions that must be met to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason Rider as follows: Purchase the policy within 10 - 21 days of First Trip Payment; Insure ALL prepaid and non-refundable travel expenses prior to departure; Trip arrangements must be canceled more than 48 -72 hours prior to the departure date.  If you meet all 3 of these conditions, most of the policies will reimburse you 75% of your trip costs, unless otherwise noted.

    I am booked on a river cruise from Vantage Travel from June 21 to July 6 flying from Washington D.C. to Amsterdam, boarding a riverboat and cruising down the Seine River through Germany, France, and Switzerland.  Do you cover river cruises like this?    
LettieH, 
 
01/27/2017





Answer:  Yes, as long as the cruise and your other travel arrangements are prepaid and non-refundable, you can obtain a comprehensive plan that includes Trip Cancellation to cover your upcoming trip.  For the destination, please select the first destination on the cruise or the destination where you are spending the most of your time in.

    I have made a deposit on a cruise but have not made the final payment. Do you know of a travel policy that covers pre-existing conditions under these circumstances?    
RonaldW, 
 
01/20/2017





Answer:  We may have a policy that will offer a Pre-Existing Conditions Waiver as long as you still have a final cruise payment to make.  This benefit is offered through Nationwide, but Nationwide only covers certain cruise lines.

Barbara, 
 
03/19/2014





Answer:  No, if you just return to the ship late this would not be covered. Only in the event that a covered reason for trip interruption occurs and causes you to miss portions of the covered trip would there be coverage to get caught up.

CharlesG,

Answer:  We do recommend that you insure a trip anytime you have a risk of losing money.  If your short cruise is not refundable then it is advisable to insure the amount of money you would lose in the event you have to cancel for a covered reason.

Wayne,

Question:
    If you arrange your own air using miles, what's the best way to protect yourself against fees for redepositing/changing?  Cost of the trip is not in dollars, but miles and fees.    
Melody, 
 
02/07/2014





Answer:  Airline miles are not generally considered an insurable cost. The fees and taxes you pay to use them can be insured for, and certain companies will also allow you to insure the cost of re-banking or re-depositing fees. There is also one company - Travel Insured - who will allow you to insure the value of the tickets, as long as the airline does NOT allow you to re-bank the miles.

Question:
    When requesting a quote, does it matter if the trip starts in America but makes a stop in Mexico.  Example,  flying from Denver to LA.  Then taking a cruise that stops in Mexico.  Would I list Cont. United States or international when requesting a quote.    
Scott, 
 
01/15/2014





Answer:  The destination is whichever country you will be spending the most time in during your trip. If you'll be visiting several destinations equally (or spending most of it on a cruise ship) then list the country where your trip begins. You will still be covered while traveling outside of the selected country, so long as you are not visiting a destination that is considered restricted. If a policy does consider certain destinations restricted, you can find this list in the terms and conditions section.

                Plans & Coverage            

Comprehensive Plans

Comprehensive travel insurance plans are the most widely known form of coverage with the most trip protection coverage available for a single trip. Typically, a comprehensive plan will offer a variety of benefits for travelers, covering a wide range of concerns, such as trip cancellation and going home early, flight delay, baggage loss or damage, 24-hour assistance and some travel medical coverage.
These the most widely known travel insurance plans because they are available for nearly any type of trip for travelers of any age.





Coverage Limits
Coverage limits for comprehensive travel insurance vary between plans and dictate the maximum amount of reimbursement in case of a claim. Typically, trip cancellation and trip interruption limits directly reflect your total trip cost. Other limits, such as medical, baggage and travel delay coverage are independent of this.
Several plans also have optional benefits that can tailor coverage to your specific trip needs. For example, if you’re traveling with business or sports equipment, you may want to compare comprehensive plans that offer coverage options for these items. If you are particularly concerned about illness or injury while traveling, you may want to compare plans with more travel medical or evacuation coverage. Also, several plans offer pre-existing condition waivers, if purchased within a specific time window. These options, often available with comprehensive plans, help to allow you to find the right plan for your trip.
Plan Exclusions
Most travel insurance plans will include a list of exclusions (such as events and items) that are not covered under the listed benefits. It’s always advisable to make sure you are well acquainted with the terms of any plan you are considering. This may help you feel more comfortable that the coverage you do buy will meet your needs and help to avoid issues in the event you file a claim.
Some exclusions can include travel delays that do not meet the required minimum or expensive sports equipment needed for your trip. Also, many plans will exclude pre-existing conditions or adventure activities from medical coverage.
Another popular coverage is trip cancellation. Many plans only provide coverage for a specific list of covered reasons for cancellation. We recommend reviewing this list to be fully aware of which reasons are included and which are not. This can help you to prepare for a claims process, if necessary.

 Respond to question


Question:
    What does waiver of pre-existing condition mean?  I plan to travel on Sept 20 to Europe. I was born on 07 Oct 1941. I have pre-existing health conditions but have been controlled for several years.  I plan to get a comprehensive travel insurance.    
LuzvismindaG, 
 
06/07/2017





Answer:  Most Comprehensive Plans will offer a waiver of pre-existing conditions if you meet the following conditions: You purchase the policy within 10 to 21 days of making your first trip payment; insure ALL prepaid non-refundable expenses prior to your departure date; and be medically fit to travel the day you purchase the policy.  If the reason you are canceling, interrupting or seeking medical coverage is related to pre-existing conditions there will be no coverage, unless you have the waiver.  A Pre-Existing Condition is any treatment, diagnostic tests or exams, any recommendations for diagnostic test or exams, or any adjustments in medication up or down within the pre-existing condition period stated (depending on the company, 60 – 180 days prior to the effective date).

Question:
    If we purchased a tour package and before or during the trip one of our parents or a relative becomes  very ill (or dies) and we have to cancel our trip or  return home early what will travel insurance cover?    
LydiaV, 
 
05/29/2017





Answer:  The number one covered reason for Trip Cancellation and Trip Interruption is the unforeseen illness or injury of you or a traveling companion that deems you unfit to travel, by order of a licensed physician; or the unforeseen hospitalization or death of a family member.  To see all of the covered reasons to cancel or interrupt your trip, please click on the dollar amount that appears under the words "Trip Cancellation" when viewing a quote.  If you had to cancel the trip for a covered reason, you are reimbursed 100%.  If you had to interrupt the trip for a covered reason, you are reimbursed the unused portion of your trip cost depending when the trip is interrupted.

Answer:  Yes, as long as you can prove that you reimbursed the travel supplier for the cost of the accommodations, you can insure that travel arrangement provided that it is prepaid and non-refundable.

    We travel several times each year to various places and don't have a lot of equipment, etc.  Mainly just want a policy that will cover major medical situations for the whole year, just in case, since we are 62 years old (although we are healthy and active now).  Is it better to buy a separate evac policy?  Is there a good option that we have not thought of?    
Trisha,

Answer:  We do provide annual medical policies for trips that take place outside of your home country.  Typically, the trips cannot be longer than 90 days per trip with most plans.

To obtain a quote, please fill out the quote form with your very first trip's details and once you arrive on the results page, please select the medical tab and view our plans that are labeled “multi trip".  Our multi-trip medical plans provide both medical and medical evacuation coverage.  You do not need to buy a separate evacuation policy unless you wanted the extra coverage.

Question:
    Do any of your policies cover Veterinary students when they go abroad to do working with wildlife or working with a wildlife vet?  If you do provide cover for working with wildlife does that also include work with lions?

Answer:  We should be able to provide coverage for this, however, some policies may have specific exclusions for this type of activity. Please check the exclusions section of the policy certificate accordingly, and please do not hesitate to call us and any representative will be happy to go over the details with you thoroughly.

Question:
    Two senior citizens traveling to Williamsburg for 4 days in early April.  Room rate unrefundable if we cancel the trip, to the tune of $600+.  Can we purchase travel insurance to cover the possibility of having to cancel this trip due to ill health of one of the travelers?  Lodge does NOT offer prospect of cancelling reservation 24 hours prior to arrival.    
JudyP, 
 
03/12/2017





Answer:  Yes.  The number one covered reason for Trip Cancellation and Trip Interruption is the unforeseen illness or injury of you or a traveling companion that deems you unfit to travel, by order of a licensed physician; or the unforeseen hospitalization or death of a family member.  To see all of the covered reasons to cancel or interrupt your trip, please click on the dollar amount that appears under the words "Trip Cancellation" when viewing a quote.  This applies to all comprehensive plans.

Question:
    Is there a policy that covers the land tour plan which is purchased separate from the flight portion? Also can you purchase the cancel for any reason when making deposits on land portion of trip and just today purchased flight portion.    
KayS, 
 
02/15/2017





Answer:  All of our comprehensive plans will cover a prepaid non-refundable land tour even if it was purchased separate from the airfare.  There are 3 conditions that must be met to purchase a Cancel For Any Reason Rider as follows: Purchase the policy within 10 - 21 days of First Trip Payment; Insure ALL prepaid and non-refundable travel expenses prior to departure; Trip arrangements must be canceled more than 48 -72 hours prior to the departure date.  If you meet all 3 of these conditions, most of the policies will reimburse you 75% of your trip costs, unless otherwise noted.

Question:
    Tours may be include airfare or be land only. I am adequately protected financially for risks related to my flights. Is there any travel insurance that is for land-only tour packages?    
LenP,

Answer:  We do not have any specific tour / land only policies at this time, unfortunately, however, you can still purchase a comprehensive plan to cover the cost of a prepaid non-refundable tour or land excursion.

Question:
    Going on a cruise as a single person.  each paying half of the cost of the stateroom. and one cancels the trip.  How would the other person be guaranteed the same room without paying the others cost.  For instance I pay 2,000 and my roomate pays 2,000. and she cancels.  I would like to still keep the same room and not pay her share.    
Anita, 
 
11/14/2016





Answer:  When viewing quotes, please click on the amount listed under Trip Cancellation to view the covered reasons for Trip Cancellation.  In this window that opens up, most policies will include wording regarding Single Supplement Coverage.  Please see below:

Single Supplement

Benefits will be paid, up to the Maximum Benefit Amount, for the additional cost incurred as a result of a change in the per person occupancy rate for Prepaid Travel Arrangements if a Traveling Companion’s or Family Member’s Trip is canceled for a covered reason and You do not cancel Your Trip.

These benefits will not duplicate any other benefits payable under the Policy or any coverage(s) attached to the Policy. 

Please keep in mind, benefits can be state specific and the wording can vary depending on where you reside.

Question:
    1)  what are "covered reasons" for CFAR policies?

2)  i'm approaching the 14 day timeframe to purchase CFAR policy.  Are there any other options available?    
PB, 
 
04/29/2014





Answer:  Cancel for any reason does not use covered reasons. The CFAR benefit lets you change your mind about the trip, doesn't matter what for. And yes, there are other plans that allow 21 days for cancel for any reason. If you get a quote on our website, there will be a filter available to only show the options with cancel for any reason.

                I did not file a claim. When I had questions about the policy before purchase the sales rep did a good job explaining everything to me. I did feel it was worth the expense since both my husband and I have elderly parents. Had something happened, we would have been covered.

                Purchasing the plan gave us piece of mind.  You actually hope you never need it and in our case, we didn't.  But when traveling so far from home and for such a long period on your own (no tours), there was comfort in knowing we had something to fall back on at a reasonable cost.            
 Jose S.                would

                I would use this company again because it was easy to see what they offered and compare it to other company plans.  It is always difficult with insurance to know exactly what is covered until you actually need the insurance; however, I downloaded the paperwork and took it with me in case we needed anything.  Fortunately, so fortunately, we did not need any coverage; however, it is essential to have it.

                This was expensive insurance, but it was a high cost trip as it was for a month and in the UK. I was injured prior to the trip and unable to travel. There was A LOT of paper work and I would advise you to be sure to keep excellent record keeping in case you have to file a claim. You will also have to wait if you are renting an accommodation like I was, to see if they can re-rent it before you file your claim to determine if you have any credit. Similarly if you have airline tickets and cancel you may only get taxes paid back so you will need documentation of all of that before filing a claim! Just an FYI.
Everyone I spoke to from the start in customer service about filing the claim was very personable and helpful. Once submitted it did take about a week longer than it stated based on the fact that they were " backed up" however once processed I received the full refund within 48hrs of notification. If I hadn't taken out the insurance I would have lost a lot of money so I would highly recommend buying a comprehensive insurance such as this from C & F Travel Insured International , especially if your trip is oversees.            
 Ruth M.                would 
                recommend this plan to a friend or relative.

Why Buy Travel Insurance For Your Cruise? Allianz Global Assistance, a world leader in travel insurance and assistance services, can offer many reasons why millions of travelers protect themselves and their families with travel insurance. They're the people we help every year through unanticipated travel delays, missed cruise embarkations and medical emergencies in foreign countries.  Last Minute Cancellation- You've been planning your dream cruise for a year - and then you get sick the day before departure. Allianz Global Assistance's cruise travel insurance can insure for covered illness, injury and even losing your job, and can ensure you get back your nonrefundable costs. On-Board Medical Emergency- Ships' doctors aren't equipped to handle serious medical crises. If you suffer a serious covered health crisis while cruising, evacuation coverage can pay to transport you to the nearest appropriate medical facility. Missed Connection- If your flight gets delayed, the ship won't wait. Allianz Global Assistance can help you make new travel arrangements to catch up with your cruise ship and may reimburse you for those additional expenses. (You must, however, make a reasonable effort to minimize travel costs.) Trip Interruption- If you have to cut your cruise short for a covered reason, travel insurance may reimburse you for the part of the cruise you miss as well as your costs to return home early.                Allianz User Reviews             The next time you travel, make sure you're protected with Travel Insurance from Allianz Global Assistance.

Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up? 
























































































Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up Against Other Travel Cards?








Simon Zhen




Jun 02, 2017 |
            Be First to Comment!

























If you're like me, you probably make it a habit of booking trips through online travel sites. They're great tools for finding deals on flight, hotels, and more. Some even offer their own credit cards to help you save more money on travel -- a great way to get rewarded for your loyalty.
I took a look at the four major online travel sites that offer credit cards -- Priceline, Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz -- and compared their cards to determine the best online travel site card.
Here's what I looked at when reviewing the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, Expedia®+ Voyager, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® cards:
Travel Site Cards - Rewards rates



Card
Bonus rewards
Base rewards




Priceline Rewards Visa
5 points per dollar on priceline.com purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Travelocity Rewards American Express
3 points per dollar on eligible Travelocity purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Expedia+ Voyager
4 Expedia+ points per dollar on eligible Expedia purchases and 2 Expedia+ points per dollar on dining & entertainment
1 Expedia+ point per dollar on all other purchases


Orbitz Rewards Visa
10% Orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app (8% through desktop/web) and 7% Orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app (6% through desktop/web)
2% Orbucks on all other purchases



You want to earn points fast, so you can get those free flights and hotel stays. So, it makes sense to first look at how quickly these online travel site credit cards can make that happen.
Orbitz Rewards Visa ®Takes First Place
Based on the numbers alone, you can see that the Orbitz Rewards Visa® card stands out with its amazing rewards rates on travel purchases made through the Orbitz website. The caveat to Orbitz is that you'll have to deal with their rather confusing Orbucks program. But once you have that figured out, great rewards follow.
For example, you can get 10% back on eligible hotels booked through the Orbitz mobile app. You can also use the mobile app to get 7% back on flights.
If you're not an app person, you can still get good rewards on desktop, but it's important to know that they differ. Either way, Orbitz rewards are highly competitive with travel credit cards.
Priceline and Travelocity Take Second Place
But, Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card have simple rewards programs. You get bonus points on travel purchases made through their sites and a flat 1 point per dollar for everything else.
Such a simple program stresses one thing: you’ll get value from these cards only if you use them for travel purchases. Otherwise, any other rewards card would be better.
Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card gives more points per dollar on bonus travel but Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card picks up the slack with a stellar redemption option.
Expedia®+ Voyager Takes Third Place
The Expedia®+ Voyager card has a rewards program that aims to convince cardholders to always keep the card in their wallets.
You’ll get bonus points for booking travel through Expedia — which is usually done online. But to get bonus points for restaurants and entertainment, you’ll have to carry the Expedia®+ Voyager card in your wallet.
To encourage more spending, the card gives you 5,000 bonus Expedia+ points. This happens when you spend $10,000 in the prior year (a 0.05% point bonus on $10,000 spent).
After our Review of the Expedia®+ Voyager Card we realized that while the rewards rate is decent and the bonus is nice, that's not enough to differentiate Expedia from the pack.

$1 Orbuck per $1



The Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card may help you rack up points the fastest, but the value of those points may not be as great as they initially seem. With the accumulated Orbucks, you can only redeem for bookings at qualifying hotels through Orbitz. That can be restrictive when you're missing the other major aspect of travel: flights.
The Expedia®+ Voyager card also forces you to use your points toward travel booked through Expedia, but at least you can use the points for flights and hotels. These redemptions are not as limiting. They are great if you happen to always find the best prices on Expedia.
Meanwhile, the two remaining cards only offer statement credits, which mean your balance is being erased by however much you earn back. I feel statement credits are the best reward options -- think of it as receiving a refund on a past purchase -- very convenient.
The Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card has one noteworthy highlight. It lets you redeem a statement credit for up to $400 on flights or eligible hotels and vacation packages with no blackout dates, booked through Travelocity for just 20,000 points (2 cents of value per 1 point). That’s an incentive for you to save up those points instead of redeeming at the lower denominations. The Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, however, is very attractive because of its extremely flexible redemption options. You can pretty much “erase” any purchase with your accumulated points. (Reminds me of the popular Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard®.)

The optimal redemption on the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is the $400 statement credit for 20,000 points, which can be earned with $6,667 in Travelocity purchases (3 points/$). Meanwhile, to redeem $400 on the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, you’ll need 40,000 points, which can be earned with $8,000 in Priceline purchases (5 points/$).
So, you’ll get slightly better redemption values with the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, but you’ll have more flexible redemption options with the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card. There’s no proper way to evaluate the two advantages so I’m calling it a tie between the two.
WINNER (Redemptions): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card)
Annual Fee

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: $0
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: $0
Expedia®+ Voyager: $95
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: $0

Travel credit cards are notorious for having annual fees -- often because they have various travel perks that justify such fees (e.g., free checked bags, complimentary lounge passes and companion tickets).
None of the online travel agency credit cards have any ties to specific airlines or hotel chains, so they don’t really have any of these standout travel benefits that would warrant an annual fee.
Of the four cards, only Expedia®+ Voyager has an annual fee. At $95 per year, it’s a quite a lot for anyone who doesn't like annual fees. But, the card has a set of great travel benefits -- particularly its $100 statement -- to make up for that fee.
However, when strictly speaking about the cost of the annual fee, it’s a three-way tie between the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Cards.
WINNER (Annual fee): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Interest Rates

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: 14.99-21.99% APR
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: 14.99-24.99% APR
Expedia®+ Voyager: 14.24-22.24% APR
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: 15.99-24.99% APR

It’s never a good idea to pay interest on a credit card, especially a rewards credit card. Also, rewards credit cards tend to have higher interest rates, which is the case for all four online travel agency credit cards.
Their APRs are relatively similar but the one with lowest average APR is Expedia®+ Voyager. Meanwhile, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card has the highest average APR -- probably because it has such high rewards rates.
Even though Expedia®+ Voyager takes the cake for interest rates, (again) I don’t ever suggest that you pay interest on any rewards credit card. The value of your rewards will be wiped out by those interest charges.
WINNER (Interest rate): Expedia®+ Voyager
Card Coverages
Did your flight get delayed for a long time? You might be compensated for lodging, food, and more as you wait for the next flight. This is just one example of how card coverages can be useful. Every credit card comes with its own suite of card coverages that you should take into account.
Below is a table that lists out the protection and coverages offered by each card:
A Barclaycard spokesperson did not reply to me with a full guide of benefits for the Priceline Rewards Visa and Travelocity Rewards Amex cards. The information below is based on standard Visa benefits (for Priceline) and on the latest Travelocity Rewards Amex benefits guide I could find online.

With the exception of the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, all of the online travel agency cards provide a decent set of card coverages that encompass regular retail purchases to travel. You’ll notice that, for the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card, I highlight certain coverages that are available only to Visa Signature cards.
Visa Signature is the upper tier version of Visa Platinum -- they offer different benefits. Priceline and Orbitz will give out different versions depending on your credit. Essentially, you want the Visa Signature version because of its extended list of coverages.
Again, looking at the chart, I’d say that the Visa Signature versions of the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card offer the best card coverages in the group. Expedia®+ Voyager was almost able to keep up with these two cards but it fell out of the contest because it doesn’t offer travel services and assistance (I spoke with a Citi customer service rep to confirm this).
WINNER (Card coverages): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card andOrbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Travel Site Cards - Travel Benefits



Card
Travel benefits




Priceline Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature)


Travelocity Rewards American Express
None


Expedia+ Voyager
$100 annual statement credit for airline incidentals on qualified airlines or Wi-Fi carries or for the Global Entry fee; no foreign transaction fees and free personal concierge


Orbitz Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature) plus no foreign transaction fees



We’re talking about online travel agency credit cards here, so we have to look at the travel perks that these cards offer (if any).
Right off the bat, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is looking bad due to a lack of any noteworthy travel benefits. So, lets focus on the other cards.
Given that Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card are capable of being Visa Signature cards, you can receive free nights and discounts through Visa’s hotel and car rental partners. However, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card stands taller with the waived foreign transaction fees, which means you’re not going to pay currency exchange fees when swiping your card abroad.
However, the card with the best travel perk is definitely Expedia®+ Voyager. The $100 statement credit can be used for a basket of things including checked bags, in-flight meals, Wi-Fi access, lounge passes on 10 major airlines (AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America Airlines) and the $100 Global Entry application fee. The Global Entry program allows pre-approved travelers to receive expedited clearance upon entry into the U.S.
Expedia®+ Voyager card has a $95 annual fee because of the $100 statement credit. If you can maximize this $100 statement credit, you’ll more than recoup the annual fee. Top this perk off with the rest of the card’s travel benefits and you’ve got a solid travel companion.
WINNER (Travel benefits): Expedia®+ Voyager
Verdict: Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card
Oddly, the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card actually tied with three winning categories each. So, why did I give the crown to thePriceline Rewards™ Visa® Card?
Firstly, the hotel-only redemption option on the Orbitz card stood out as a major restriction to how you can spend your points. And, it carries the highest average APR of the group. These two aspects led me to favor the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card.
Winners and Losers, You Decide
Ultimately, you know what's best for your needs and preferences. This rundown is meant to give you as much information as possible, but you know yourself better than anyone else.
Your credit cards should help you enjoy and get the most out of your experience, but they are not the experience. Choose your destination, choose your credit card, and be present in the moment.

Travel Insurance

																								





If you have an upcoming trip planned, you owe it to yourself to look into travel insurance. It's an unfortunate reality that things happen when we least expect them. We've found that experts generally recommend travel insurance, and the savviest of travelers look at it as a wise choice.
If you think that your credit card company will protect you, think again.  Credit card companies may cover certain aspects of airline costs if your tickets go missing or become worthless, but they will not help you if your flight is delayed and your cruise is missed. Nor will they help if you suffer an injury or illness while traveling.

Continued from above
Standard insurance policies often fail when it comes to travel. For example, you may already have a medical insurance policy. However, most of these plans don't have a list of doctors to assist you in European countries, for example, or off the Coast of Barbados. You may have to pay 100% out of pocket expenses just to get assistance. In these cases, travel insurance with medical coverage can save you thousands of dollars in the event that you need to be treated by adequate medical staff.
Before you purchase travel insurance, you want to make sure that you select the best company to meet your needs. Important aspects of travel insurance providers include:

Coverage.  What specifically will the travel insurance cover during your trip?
Reimbursement.  When and how fast will the travel insurance company step in to pay for what you need?
Cost.  Does the travel insurance company charge a reasonable fee for the coverage they offer?

When Should You Buy Travel Insurance?
If you�re making plans for your vacation or your family�s vacation, you need to determine whether you want to purchase travel insurance. Travel insurance may be another expense, but it can be well worth it so that you�re covered in case of an emergency or problem.
Not many years ago, few people purchased travel insurance. However, that's changing fast. In fact, according to the U.S. Travel Insurance Association, in the last 10 years the percentage of American travelers purchasing travel insurance increased from 10 to 30 percent. Travelers purchase insurance for a few reasons including protection against unexpected events, loss of the financial investment in the trip,
and peace of mind.
Like many things, travel insurance can cover a wide variety of problems and will reimburse your costs for many situations. But you should know what type of insurance you need for your specific situation.
Here are a couple of tips on when you should buy travel insurance.

You should consider buying travel insurance anytime the cost of the trip is more than the cost of the insurance. For example, if you�re purchasing a $75 nonrefundable airline ticket, you probably don�t want to invest in travel insurance that protects you from trip cancellation or interruption. However, if you�ve purchased a cruise vacation or all-inclusive resort stay for $3,000 - $10,000, you
may
want to protect that investment by purchasing travel insurance just in case you have to cancel due to illness, family emergencies, or other reasons. Travel insurance packages can also protect you in case the cruise line or resort experiences financial problems, such as going out of business between the time you pay for the trip and the time you get there. Be certain not to purchase this insurance from the cruise line or resort, as your coverage will be worthless if they go out of business.
You should purchase travel insurance whenever you travel outside the U.S. Whether you�re traveling by cruise ship or by airplane, your health insurance may or may not cover any medical expenses you incur outside of the United States. This includes travelling on "foreign-flagged" cruise ships. If you�re travelling in U.S. waters on a foreign-flagged cruise ship, your medical insurance
may
not cover you if you become sick or injured. Travel insurance companies that offer medical coverage can also help facilitate any medical payments needed while in a foreign country, act as your advocate, and help cover costs associated with transporting you back home for medical reasons.

There are a variety of reasons to purchase travel insurance and a variety of options to cover you and your vacation. Be sure to look for a travel insurance policy from a dependable company so that your vacation investment is protected, and you can relax and enjoy your trip!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
