      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-10
    





July 30, 2013 03:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-10, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-10 (SEMT 
      2013-10):
    

      --$371,622,000 class A-1 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-2 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-3 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-4 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-5 exchangeable certificate 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-6 exchangeable 
      certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 class A-7 
      exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-8 exchangeable certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO1 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO2 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,811,000 
      class A-IO3 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$371,622,000 
      class A-IO notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$10,217,000 
      class B-1 certificate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$6,811,000 class 
      B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$4,608,000 class B-3 
      certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$3,205,000 non-offered class 
      B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.25% 
      subordination provided by the 2.55% class B-1, 1.70% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.80% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $4,208,564 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, CitiMortgage, Inc. will act as 
      the master servicer and Wilmington Trust will act as the Trustee for the 
      transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to 
      treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-10 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's tenth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. All of the loans 
      are fully amortizing. The aggregate pool included loans originated from 
      PrimeLending (8.5%) and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital (7.6%). The 
      remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage 
      lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 529 loans with a 
      total balance of $400,671,564; an average balance of $757,413; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 68.1%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.9%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 45.5% and 5.0% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 775. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 95.2% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (40.9%), 
      Texas (9.4%) and Virginia (6.7%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists of 30-year 
      fully amortizing, fully documented FRMs to borrowers with strong credit 
      profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was conducted on 99.8% of the pool, and Fitch 
      believes the results of the review generally indicate strong 
      underwriting controls.
    

      Originators with Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      The lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the 100% 
      third-party diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in 
      immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit enhancement (CE) on 
      this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The collateral pool is geographically 
      diverse. The percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas 
      (MSAs) is 23.1% and concentration in California is 40.9%, similar to 
      recent SEMT transactions. The agency did not apply a default penalty to 
      the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Deal Framework: The representation, 
      warranty and enforcement mechanism framework is viewed positively, as it 
      is consistent with Fitch criteria. As in other recent Fitch-rated SEMT 
      transactions, SEMT 2013-10 contains binding arbitration provisions that 
      may serve to provide timely resolution to representation and warranty 
      disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or more delinquent 
      will be reviewed for breaches of representations and warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions, Fitch's sustainable home price (SHP) model 
      does not project declines in home prices. This region is 
      Dallas-Plano-Irving in Texas (4.3%). Fitch conducted sensitivity 
      analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% compared with those 
      projected by Fitch's SHP model for this region. The sensitivity analysis 
      indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    

      In its analysis, Fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent 
      economic performance in determining market value declines. While Fitch's 
      current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one 
      year of projections, this does not incorporate recent notable economic 
      improvement. To reflect the more recent economic environment, a 
      sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical 
      economic data and two years of projections. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. This sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 13.7%, slightly less than the 14.5% base sMVD projected 
      in the current model.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model-projected 14.5% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-10'.

      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for 
      the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made 
      to treat the trust as two real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-1 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's first 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime mortgage loans, with 79% fixed rate 
      mortgages (FRMs) and 21% five-, seven-, and 10-year hybrid adjustable 
      rate mortgages (ARMs). The loans are predominantly fully amortizing; 
      however, 5% have a 10-year interest-only (IO) period. The aggregate pool 
      included loans originated from first-time contributor EverBank (37%), 
      First Republic Bank (7%), PrimeLending (6%), Fremont Bank (6%), Flagstar 
      Bank, F.S.B. (6%) and Rockland Trust Company (5%). The remainder of the 
      mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage lending institutions, 
      each of which contributed less than 5% to the transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 511 loans with a 
      total balance of $397,881,280; an average balance of $778,633; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 67.7%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 4%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 60% and 6.6% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 769. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 94.9% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (42.9%), 
      Texas (13.2%) and Massachusetts (9.6%).
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-1'.

 Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 
On or about December 23, 2009, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (the “FHLB-Seattle”) filed a complaint in the Superior Court for the State of
Washington (case number 09-2-46348-4 SEA) against the depositor, Redwood Trust, Inc. (“Redwood Trust”), Morgan Stanley & Co., and Morgan Stanley Capital I, Inc. (collectively, the “FHLB-Seattle Defendants”) alleging that the
FHLB-Seattle Defendants made false or misleading statements in offering materials for a mortgage pass-through certificate (the “Seattle Certificate”) issued in the Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2005-4 securitization transaction (the “2005-4
RMBS”) and purchased by the FHLB-Seattle. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the alleged misstatements concern the (1) loan-to-value ratio of mortgage loans and the appraisals of the properties that secured loans supporting the 2005-4
RMBS, (2) occupancy status of the properties, (3) standards used to underwrite the loans, and (4) ratings assigned to the Seattle Certificate. The FHLB-Seattle alleges claims under the Securities Act of Washington (Section 21.20.005, et seq.) and
seeks to rescind the purchase of the Seattle Certificate and to collect interest on the original purchase price at the statutory interest rate of 8% per annum from the date of original purchase (net of interest received) as well as attorneys’
fees and costs. The Seattle Certificate was issued with an original principal amount of approximately $133 million, and, as of December 31, 2015, the FHLB-Seattle has received approximately $120 million of principal and $11 million of interest
payments in respect of the Seattle Certificate. As of December 31, 2015, the Seattle Certificate had a remaining outstanding principal amount of approximately $13 million. The claims were subsequently dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction as
to the depositor and Redwood Trust. The depositor and Redwood Trust agreed to indemnify the underwriters of the 2005-4 RMBS for certain losses and expenses they might incur as a result of claims made against them relating to this RMBS, including,
without limitation, certain legal expenses. The FHLB-Seattle’s claims against the underwriters of this RMBS were not dismissed and remain pending. Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the depositor and Redwood Trust could incur a loss
as a result of these indemnities. 


On or about July 15, 2010, The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) filed a complaint in the Superior
Court for the State of California in San Francisco (case number CGC-10-501610) against the depositor and 26 other defendants (collectively, the “Schwab Defendants”) alleging that the Schwab Defendants made false or misleading statements in
offering materials for various residential mortgage-backed securities sold or issued by the Schwab Defendants. Schwab alleged only a claim for negligent misrepresentation under California state law against the depositor and sought unspecified
damages and attorneys’ fees and costs from the depositor. Schwab claims that the depositor made false or misleading statements in offering materials for a mortgage pass-through certificate (the “Schwab Certificate”) issued in the
2005-4 RMBS and purchased by Schwab. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the misstatements for the 2005-4 RMBS concern the (1) loan-to-value ratio of mortgage loans and the appraisals of the properties that secured loans supporting the 2005-4
RMBS, (2) occupancy status of the properties, (3) standards used to underwrite the loans, and (4) ratings assigned to the Schwab Certificate. On November 14, 2014, Schwab voluntarily dismissed with prejudice its negligent misrepresentation claim,
which resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of the depositor from the action. The Schwab Certificate was issued with an original principal amount of approximately $15 million, and, as of December 31, 2015, Schwab has received approximately $13
million of principal and $1 million of interest payments have been made in respect of the Schwab Certificate. As of December 31, 2015, the Schwab Certificate had a remaining outstanding principal amount of approximately $1 million. The depositor and
Redwood Trust agreed to indemnify the underwriters of the 2005-4 RMBS, which underwriters were also named and remain as defendants in the action, for certain losses and expenses they might incur as a result of claims made against them relating to
this RMBS, including, without limitation, certain legal expenses. Regardless of the outcome of this litigation, the depositor and Redwood Trust could incur a loss as a result of these indemnities. 
The business of the sponsor, the depositor, the seller and their affiliates has included, and continues to include, activities relating to the acquisition and
securitization of residential mortgage loans. In addition, the business of the sponsor has, in the past, included activities relating to the acquisition and securitization of debt obligations and other assets through the issuance of collateralized
debt obligations (commonly referred to as CDO transactions). Because of their involvement in the securitization and CDO businesses, the sponsor, the depositor, the seller and their affiliates could become the subject of litigation relating to these
businesses, including additional litigation of the type described above, and could also become the subject of governmental investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits and governmental authorities could allege that these entities violated
applicable law or regulation in the conduct of their business.
 The depositor has been notified by Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) and U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), respectively, of material pending legal proceedings to which Citibank, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank are, respectively, subject in connection with their
role as trustee on certain RMBS transactions. This Sequoia transaction is not a party to nor subject to the pending legal proceedings.  The disclosure
that the depositor received from each of Citibank, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, respectively, is included here:
 Citibank, N.A. 
Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) is acting as Securities Administrator of this RMBS transaction. In the ordinary course of business, Citibank is involved
in a number of legal proceedings, including in connection with its role as trustee of certain RMBS transactions. Certain of these Citibank as trustee-related matters are disclosed herein. 
On June 18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS
trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank’s alleged failure to
perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action. On the same day, a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank
allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in the state court. In January 2015, the
court closed plaintiffs’ original state court action. Citibank’s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of May 13, 2015. On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and
allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. That case, involving the three remaining trusts, is pending.  On November 24, 2015,
the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee. This case includes the 24
trusts previously dismissed in the federal action, and one additional trust. The investors assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York’s Streit Act.
Citibank filed a motion to dismiss this case on February 26, 2016. 


On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as Receiver for a financial institution
filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York. This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee. FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract, violation of the Streit Act,
and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and whose cases are all in front of
Judge Carter.
 There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However,
Citibank denies liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations. Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibank’s ability to
perform its duties as securities administrator under the pooling and servicing agreement for this RMBS transaction.  Item 1119 of Regulation AB,
Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.  The seller and servicing administrator, the sponsor and the depositor are each either
directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. There is not currently, and there was not during the past two years, any material business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding that is or was
entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is or was on terms other than would be obtained in an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated third party, between (a) any of the seller, the sponsor, the depositor and the issuing
entity on the one hand and (b) any of the trustee, any servicer, the custodian, the master servicer, the securities administrator or either originator of the mortgage loans on the other hand. 
Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of
compliance are attached hereto under Item 15.
 The registrant has prepared the Table below in connection with this transaction. The Table shows, in one
compiled format, which entity participating in a servicing function for this transaction was assigned responsibility for each criterion in Item 1122(d). In the Table below, certain criteria are not applicable, given the structure of the
offering, and accordingly no entity is assigned responsibility for such criteria.  Also, Wilmington Trust, National Association (“Wilmington”),
the trustee, does not participate in any servicing function for the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing. Therefore, there is no reference to Wilmington in the chart below; nor does this 10-K filing include any assessment or
auditor report from Wilmington. Finally, any discrepancies between the chart below and the assessment of compliance exhibit provided by any party listed in the chart is explained by the fact that the chart is specific to the transaction that is the
subject of this 10-K filing, whereas each party’s respective assessment of compliance is issued on a platform basis and includes coverage of other additional transactions that are not the subject of this 10-K filing.

Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) are not performed by Cenlar. In this SEMT 2013-8 transaction, the Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) servicing criteria functions, as to Cenlar FSB, are instead performed by Wells Fargo, as custodian.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Suited Connector has received 4.54 out of 5 stars based on 10 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
