History



The public company Kelso Technologies Inc. began as a mining equipment supplier in March 1987.  Over time the focus of the company moved into the railway equipment supply industry.  By 1996 Kelso's new VP of Engineering, Barry LaCroix, had developed a pressure relief valve for the North American rail tank car market for which Kelso would act as the distributor.  The company was a small player that failed to gain sales traction with the pressure relief valve that received regulatory approval and became available for sale in 2001. 
After the US economy shrank in late 2008 and throughout 2009, Kelso struggled financially.  In April 2010 the Board of Directors brought in a business developer, James R. Bond, and other key management to begin the rebuilding process.  With a newly patented manway technology to offer in addition to the pressure relief valves, the company began the regulatory approval process for the manway and commenced the marketing of their safer technology for the transport of hazardous goods to the rail tank car industry.

Emergency Reponse KitMarketwiredJuly 26, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA and BONHAM, TEXAS--(Marketwired - Jul 26, 2016) -  Kelso Technologies Inc. (KLS.TO)(NYSE MKT:KIQ) ("Kelso" or the "Company") reports that the Company has successfully completed initial commercial testing of its new emergency response kit known as the Kelso ERK (ERK). This specialized equipment is used by first responders to cap and contain chemical leaks in the field that originate in a HAZMAT rail tank car's valve assembly or its connections located on the top of the tank car. The ERK is specifically designed to be implemented quickly and safely to reduce potential dangers to human life and environmental harm to communities during emergency events involving hazardous materials.The ERK was developed in partnership with hazardous materials specialists from a Class 1 Railroad company. It has numerous advantages for its users over current competitive designs:Compact - the Kelso ERK fits in two containers which is a reduction from the three containers currently used. The ERK takes up less space on emergency response vehicles and allows handling by one person.   Built with lightweight materials - the ERK is half the weight of existing products providing easier deployment and operation of the ERK by emergency responders.   No additional application tools are required, which reduces kit weight and complexity of operation.   Color-coded valve caps aid first responder in selecting proper valve cap under emergency conditions.   Friction reduction system lowers torque needed to apply the valve cap. This reduces the number of tools needed to effectively apply the ERK, reducing the potential effects of human error and potential injury to first responders.   The ERK is designed for both pressure tank cars which include commodities such as chlorine, liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia and non-pressurized tank cars.   The Kelso ERK is the only emergency kit in the market that is designed to handle general service tank cars. The ERK meets the design requirements of many first responder stakeholders in North America. These stakeholders include the National Hazardous Materials Response Team and their 13 regional response centers; six Class 1 railroads; 700 Class 2 and 3 railroads; and training organizations like the Transportation Technology Center, Inc (TTCI) - a division of the American Rail Road Association and TRANSCAER® which provides a voluntary national outreach effort that focuses on assisting communities prepare for and respond to a possible hazardous material accident event. Both TTCI and TRANSCAER® have direct influential relationships with the many first responders in North America.James R. Bond, CEO of the Company comments that "The ERK represents a new diverse multi-million dollar market for the Company. Kelso has completed all required design specifications in collaboration with our Class 1 railroad partner and is now prepared to begin distribution of the ERK to first responder organizations. We are proud of the new benefits engineered into the ERK on behalf of our stakeholders and all first responders. Our reputation for innovative design continues to grow in markets beyond rail tank cars, providing new revenue streams for the Company."About Kelso TechnologiesKelso is a railway equipment supplier that designs, produces and sells proprietary tank car service equipment used in the safe handling and containment of hazardous materials during transport.

  (TSX:KLS)(NYSE MKT:KIQ) ("Kelso" or the "Company") reports that the Company has successfully completed initial commercial testing
  of its new emergency response kit known as the Kelso ERK (ERK). This specialized equipment is used by first responders to
  cap and contain chemical leaks in the field that originate in a HAZMAT rail tank car's valve assembly or its connections located
  on the top of the tank car. The ERK is specifically designed to be implemented quickly and safely to reduce potential
  dangers to human life and environmental harm to communities during emergency events involving hazardous materials. 
The ERK was developed in partnership with hazardous materials specialists from a Class 1 Railroad company. It has
  numerous advantages for its users over current competitive designs:

Compact - the Kelso ERK fits in two containers which is a reduction from the three containers currently used. The ERK
    takes up less space on emergency response vehicles and allows handling by one person.
    

Built with lightweight materials - the ERK is half the weight of existing products providing easier deployment and
    operation of the ERK by emergency responders.
    

No additional application tools are required, which reduces kit weight and complexity of operation.
    

Color-coded valve caps aid first responder in selecting proper valve cap under emergency conditions.
    

Friction reduction system lowers torque needed to apply the valve cap. This reduces the number of tools needed to
    effectively apply the ERK, reducing the potential effects of human error and potential injury to first responders.
    

The ERK is designed for both pressure tank cars which include commodities such as chlorine, liquefied petroleum gas and
    anhydrous ammonia and non-pressurized tank cars. 
    

The Kelso ERK is the only emergency kit in the market that is designed to handle general service tank cars.

The ERK meets the design requirements of many first responder stakeholders in North America. These stakeholders include
  the National Hazardous Materials Response Team and their 13 regional response centers; six Class 1 railroads; 700 Class 2 and 3
  railroads; and training organizations like the Transportation Technology Center, Inc (TTCI) - a division of the American Rail
  Road Association and TRANSCAER® which provides a voluntary national outreach effort that focuses on assisting
  communities prepare for and respond to a possible hazardous material accident event. Both TTCI and TRANSCAER®
  have direct influential relationships with the many first responders in North America.
James R. Bond, CEO of the Company comments that "The ERK represents a new diverse multi-million dollar market for the
  Company. Kelso has completed all required design specifications in collaboration with our Class 1 railroad partner and is
  now prepared to begin distribution of the ERK to first responder organizations. We are proud of the new benefits engineered
  into the ERK on behalf of our stakeholders and all first responders. Our reputation for innovative design continues to grow
  in markets beyond rail tank cars, providing new revenue streams for the Company."
