Rick B. Smith, beloved husband, father and grandfather, went to be with the Lord on January 7, 2017.
Rickey Bud Smith was born on April 16, 1958 in Midland, TX, one of three sons to Eddie Lee & Gladys Smith. He grew up in Midland, and graduated from Midland High School in 1976.  Shortly after, he met and married the love of his life, Mary Cannon on August 26, 1978.  He was in business with his father, E.L. Smith, and two brothers, Danny & Don, at Smith Brother’s Pipe for many years, enduring the numerous booms and busts of the Permian Basin oil business.  Always an entrepreneur, he founded Smith Industries, Inc. in 2004, where he built a family-owned company.  He took great pride in everyone who has been a part of seeing that dream through.
Above all things, Rick valued God, Family, Country, Honesty, and Hard Work. He was extremely gifted in so many areas. His personality was bigger than life.  Everybody loved being around him, and sharing in his wisdom and talents.  Rick also valued people, having a positive attitude, and had a true passion for the outdoors, guns, and cars.  He loved sharing these passions with others, which included coaching his Gunsmoke 4-H shooting team, and every other sport you can imagine.  He had a huge heart for those less fortunate, and humbly served countless charities throughout his life, never thinking twice before giving to anyone he could.  His country and our military meant the world to him.  He never owned a piece of property where our “Old Glory,” wasn’t flying high, with a bright light shining on it.
Rick is survived by his loving wife of 38 years, Mary Smith. His pride and joy came from their 3 children, Chris, Sally and Sarah.  Chris, his wife Alishia, Sally, her husband Dane Crunk, and Sarah, her husband Colton Wilber, all of Midland.  Rick was blessed with 10 grandchildren:  Drew, Kate, Cash, Truitt, Tristin, Blake, Blayde, Malone, Delayni and Gentry.  He will always be their, “Papa Bear,” their HERO, and the man who passed on so many values to each of them.  They share his love for the great outdoors, and will always treasure that bond.  He is also survived by his two brothers, Danny Smith and wife, Connie, Don Smith, and wife Debbie, all of Midland, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.  He is preceded in death by his parents, Eddie Lee & Gladys Lilly Smith.
The family would like to express their gratitude to all who knew and loved Rick. Each of you were special to him, and he valued your friendships and relationship more than you will ever know.  We are truly blessed by each of you.
We will honor his life at a service at Stonegate Fellowship, at 2:00 pm, on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. Burial will immediately follow at Resthaven Memorial Park. The family will accept guests from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Tuesday, January 10, 2017 at the Branch at Nalley-Pickle & Welch Funeral Home in Midland.
In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Show of Support Hunt for Heroes Project, Larry Ratheal Scholarship Fund, or the Make-A-Wish Foundation, all of which were near and dear to his heart.
Arrangements are under the direction of Nalley, Pickle & Welch Funeral Home of Midland. Online condolences may be made at www.npwelch.com.

          Mary, Don, Danny and  Family;
I've known Rick, Brothers Don and Danny, Dad and Uncle who founded Smith Brothers beginning in 1980. The Smith Brother's Yard was located on Florida Street and I was employed by The George Tope Company that leased the yard behind Smith Brother's yard on Cloverdale. We owned a smaller forklift that was not capable to unload and load larger loads of pipe and Pumping Units arriving at our yard. We depended upon The good hearted and accommodating generosity of the Gang at Smith Brothers, especially Rick who did most of their Forklift work. Anytime we had loads that needed a larger forklift, we called and asked if Rick would help us. He always responded quickly and happy to help us. We abused our privilege, which is a gross understatement. All the years of knowing This gentle good hearted businessman He was always eager to help his fellowman. He loved His Country, All the men and women who served their Country. 
You can't help but love All These true gentlemen, The Smith Brother's.
May God give you comfort and understanding in your time of grief. Be comforted with 
II Corinthians 5:8 "To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord". Yiou are in our Prayers.

Love, Donn

          Although it has been thirty five years since I last saw Rick, I am filled with regret regarding this loss.  He was always busy helping his friends do something, whether it be with their business to working on their hobbies, Bud was an all appropriate part of his name.  He is missed and my deepest condolences go out to his Family.  I have never met any of you, but, I know what you are made of and that is good enough for me.  RIP Rick, you done good.

Hunt Smith - Product

















Puppy Development #1 DVDPuppy Development #1 DVDThis is not a puppy training video, but rather a video to teach you how to develop your puppy's behavioral patterns. Conquering behavior at a young age means a better behaved dog later. Working through the steps in this video will prepare your dog to listen to orders so that you can train him successfully.
Puppy Development reviews six opportunities to gain your dog's willing acceptance of restrictions which is necessary in training. This willing acceptance behavior will be demonstrated in six sections: Crate conditioning, Care and Maintenance, Table Work, Puppy Drag Line, Stake-out Chain, and The Short Lead.


This video is the first step to developing a dog that is a pleasure to be around. If you enjoy Puppy Development I, be sure to add The Silent Command System to your dog training video collection.

Rick B. Smith, beloved husband, father and grandfather, went to be with the Lord on January 7, 2017.
Rickey Bud Smith was born on April 16, 1958 in Midland, TX, one of three sons to Eddie Lee & Gladys Smith. He grew up in Midland, and graduated from Midland High School in 1976.  Shortly after, he met and married the love of his life, Mary Cannon on August 26, 1978.  He was in business with his father, E.L. Smith, and two brothers, Danny & Don, at Smith Brother’s Pipe for many years, enduring the numerous booms and busts of the Permian Basin oil business.  Always an entrepreneur, he founded Smith Industries, Inc. in 2004, where he built a family-owned company.  He took great pride in everyone who has been a part of seeing that dream through.
Above all things, Rick valued God, Family, Country, Honesty, and Hard Work. He was extremely gifted in so many areas. His personality was bigger than life.  Everybody loved being around him, and sharing in his wisdom and talents.  Rick also valued people, having a positive attitude, and had a true passion for the outdoors, guns, and cars.  He loved sharing these passions with others, which included coaching his Gunsmoke 4-H shooting team, and every other sport you can imagine.  He had a huge heart for those less fortunate, and humbly served countless charities throughout his life, never thinking twice before giving to anyone he could.  His country and our military meant the world to him.  He never owned a piece of property where our “Old Glory,” wasn’t flying high, with a bright light shining on it.
Rick is survived by his loving wife of 38 years, Mary Smith. His pride and joy came from their 3 children, Chris, Sally and Sarah.  Chris, his wife Alishia, Sally, her husband Dane Crunk, and Sarah, her husband Colton Wilber, all of Midland.  Rick was blessed with 10 grandchildren:  Drew, Kate, Cash, Truitt, Tristin, Blake, Blayde, Malone, Delayni and Gentry.  He will always be their, “Papa Bear,” their HERO, and the man who passed on so many values to each of them.  They share his love for the great outdoors, and will always treasure that bond.  He is also survived by his two brothers, Danny Smith and wife, Connie, Don Smith, and wife Debbie, all of Midland, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.  He is preceded in death by his parents, Eddie Lee & Gladys Lilly Smith.
The family would like to express their gratitude to all who knew and loved Rick. Each of you were special to him, and he valued your friendships and relationship more than you will ever know.  We are truly blessed by each of you.
We will honor his life at a service at Stonegate Fellowship, at 2:00 pm, on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. Burial will immediately follow at Resthaven Memorial Park. The family will accept guests from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Tuesday, January 10, 2017 at the Branch at Nalley-Pickle & Welch Funeral Home in Midland.
In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Show of Support Hunt for Heroes Project, Larry Ratheal Scholarship Fund, or the Make-A-Wish Foundation, all of which were near and dear to his heart.
Arrangements are under the direction of Nalley, Pickle & Welch Funeral Home of Midland. Online condolences may be made at www.npwelch.com.
