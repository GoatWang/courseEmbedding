What are analysts saying about Rockwell Automation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Rockwell Automation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Rockwell Automation’s third quarter fiscal 2017 top and bottom line improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The increases in earnings were primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Backed by strong performance in fiscal 2017 so far and an improving macro environment, the company hiked adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $6.60 to $6.80 and projects sales to be around $6.3 billion. The company will benefit from the consistent growth in the consumer and transportation verticals and expects heavy industries to grow in 2017 despite the prevailing softness in oil and gas and mining. Further, increased investment, acquisitions, product launches and share repurchases will support growth. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/28/2017)
2. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "We are updating our model following ROK's F1Q17 earnings release. Our 2017E core growth goes to 3% from 1% driven by better than expected book/bill and actual results in the quarter. We had previously expected the year to be more back-end loaded. Our 2017E EPS goes to $6.25 from $6.10. Our 2018E EPS goes to $6.90 from $6.85, as we remain somewhat conservative in light of low visibility on timing /magnitude of the recovery.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 11 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.07)Consensus Price Target: $148.31 (9.83% downside)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Is Congress on the brink of shooting itself in the . . . checkbook? 
Congress seems to have forgotten that the value of the American dollar is based upon the strength of belief in the ability of U.S. Government and Federal banks to meet their obligations.   If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, this could trigger a whole host of defaults, which could impact the value of the dollars we Americans carry in our pockets. Dr. Tiemann explains why raising the debt ceiling matters to the stability of the whole banking system.   Click here to read Dr. Tiemann's viewpoint on Why the Debt Ceiling Debate Matters also recently published in the FT's Long Room.

Investors Benefit from Access to Real Expertise 


	Too many individual investors do not have direct access to an investment expert.  Even extraordinarily high net worth individuals and well-endowed family offices with complex portfolios often deal with "advisors" who use third-party funds or outside managers to actually handle their clients' investments.  They never speak directly with the investment expert who manages their funds. As a result, they can have trouble finding out when their funds are overlapping, overpaying with layers of fees, or simply failing to make timely decisions that cost them in total market return.  Dr. Jonathan Tiemann founded Tiemann Investment Advisors (TIA) to help address this need for individual investors.


	Building on Dr. Tiemann's twenty years of high-level experience in academia and institutional money management, TIA embodies a distinctive investment philosophy and implementation strategy that makes real investment expertise accessible to individuals—so your questions get answered and you are confident that your portfolio is structured for your needs.


	TIA applies academic rigor, institutional know-how, thoughtful individual analysis and the leverage of technology (so we stay cost-effective) — to the design and management of your unique portfolio. Dr. Tiemann, a top investment expert (rather than a sales representative), works directly with you. He analyzes your situation, designs your investment program, manages your portfolio, and restores your confidence.



		In many traditional investment firms, the client-facing staff – the financial “advisors” – are primarily and functionally salespeople. Depending on the firm, they may really be brokers, rather than investment advisors. Such individuals, while friendly and charming, earn commissions based upon what financial products they can sell to their clients.  Lacking deep investment expertise, they may rely on some basic tools — sometimes displaying impressive "bells and whistles" — to choose from a narrow menu of investment portfolios at their firm.  Their clients will never get access to a real investment expert — those experts oversee "template" portfolios and attend group promotional events in support of the large sales teams.  You may get introduced to one of those experts, but in most traditional firms, they will not ever really know you, your specific circumstances – or your portfolio.
	


	TIA eliminates the sales intermediary and brings the expert, Dr. Tiemann, to the center of the process. You and he meet directly, discussing you, your family, your financial needs, and your portfolio. He evaluates the cost basis and tax issues that characterize your existing investments. Then he designs the right portfolio that balances structure with flexibility, outlook with cash and taxability needs, presenting a proposal to you to review and approve. If you have an existing portfolio, TIA's proposal will consider trading costs, tax impacts, and the expenses of your existing investments. Only then will TIA proceed to implement your new portfolio, carefully tweaking an existing portfolio to minimize trading costs, tax impacts, excess management layers and other frictional costs to best exploit the after-tax returns available to you. You will get TIA's monthly and quarterly reports on market and portfolio performance from TIA and, since your funds remain secure within your own custodian account, you get a confirming report from your custodian.


	With TIA, you receive the benefit of top investment knowledge, experience and analytical power at every step. You know who is managing your investments, and he knows you and your particular needs. And because TIA’s portfolio approach eliminates layers of fund managers, distribution, marketing and sales costs as well as unncessary taxes on realized gains, your total return after tax may be higher.


	 



We know investment management, we know your portfolio and we know you.  This is the TIA difference.



Tiemann Investment Advisors, LLC is a Registered Investment Advisor, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional important information is available on TIA's Form ADV, Part 2.  Printed copies are also available.

ARCHIVE 2
 













Evaluating the Alternatives (November 2004)
Explains one of the greatest fallacies of investing — the belief that investing is a game of outguessing the markets. With predictions of weak returns, can stock pickers, market timers and hedge funds pick up the slack? Reviews strategies for the disciplined investor, including security selection, dynamic reallocation across sectors, styles and asset classes and hedge funds.












Be Tax-Smart with your Tax-Deferred Accounts (June 2004)
Explains how best to take advantage of the tax advantages of different types of investments, such as IRAs, taxable accounts and how the asset location decision complements the asset allocation decision. Explores strategies for enhancing after tax results by concentrating fixed income in tax deferred accounts and equity in taxable accounts.












What’s all the Fuss about Interest Rates? (May 2004)
Discussion of Federal Reserve interest rate policy as of the current time, with background on the Federal Funds Rate and other important interest rate benchmarks. Looks at ways investors may reduce portfolio risk in anticipation of interest rate increases.












Lessons from the House of Morgan (February 2004)
Discussion of strategies for building portfolios to withstand financial shocks, with comparisons to the work of Julia Morgan, who designed Hearst Castle by making important and innovative decisions applying technology and methodology to bolster the internal structure to withstand shocks. Explains how investors can take proven, disciplined, steps to improve the soundness of their portfolios, while remaining in the market for the long term growth that it yields.












How Good Was It? (January 2004)
This note summarizes market in 2003 with historical data and comparison to the markets and the economy from the period of the Great Depression through to World War II. Reveals how investors seeking long-term gains can obtain the results they seek if they establish and maintain the equity market exposure they need while building into their portfolios the allocation and diversification disciplines necessary to moderate and control their risks.












More on the Hidden Costs of Investing (December 2003)
General discussion of the drag that excessive costs can place on investment performance. In this note, Dr. Tiemann examines some of the costs, explicit and hidden, you pay in your investment program. Looks at how the trading costs in portfolios of individual securities and sales charges for mutual funds become an important factor in overall returns. Why investors need to be cost-conscious by understanding how investments are designed, built and sold, or risk paying too much.










Why the Mutual Fund Scandal Matters (November 2003)
An analysis of an investigation by New York State Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, investigating the practices of certain mutual funds that were alleged to be allowing certain hedge funds to place late orders to trade in mutual fund shares to act on news that had previously happened, allowing them to buy or sell mutual funds at the days end price after the close of the market. Dr, Tiemann explains how the charges of “late trading” and “market timing” permit privileged investors to have more than their fair share at the expense of ordinary fund holders.










TIPS for your Bond Portfolio (September 2003)
General background on TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) U.S. Treasury Bonds whose payouts are indexed to the Consumer Price Index. This note examines how TIPS work, their advantage over ordinary Treasuries, potential risks and tax implications.

It Isn’t a Forecast

Read this note to understand the Fed's role and reasons for its actions better.
