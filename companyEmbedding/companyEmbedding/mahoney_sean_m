About






My passion is to turn ideas into businesses. I have founded or co-founded 8 early stage ventures. This has resulted in 4 revenue generating, cash flow positive products and 4 currently in development and pre-launch. I always seek to identify problems that technology can solve, and then lead software development and go-to-market teams to build companies.
I’m an entrepreneurial executive with an expertise in mobile applications and software architecture. I strive to keep accountability at the center of my management style. I started by career as an engineer, so I understand the implications of all technology which goes into every product my company makes.
I am always interested in process redevelopment, information systems implementations, and strategic planning of information architectures. As a small business owner, I enjoy interacting with clients and solving problems while managing Agile / SCRUM methodologies in practice.
One of the major areas I enjoy focusing strongly on are among the problems which can benefit from “mobile-like” interfaces, namely in specialized hardware environments where mobile applications can benefit stakeholders and move data in new and exciting ways.
In my free time, I love golf, and enjoy meeting with young entrepreneurs and love hearing about new and exciting things people are doing in today’s tech-savvy world.
