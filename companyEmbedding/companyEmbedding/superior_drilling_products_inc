DR Stinger | SDPI - Superior Drilling Products







































































DR Stinger










				DR Stinger is designed to optimize dedicated reamer operations.  DR Stinger utilizes our fully patented Drill-n-Ream (DNR) tool with its dual stage eccentric reamers which condition well bores by increasing well bore drift. The two reamer stages spaced approximately five feet apart act in unison to force each other into the formation while efficiently reducing ledges, doglegs, and well bore tortuosity.  With DR Stinger, a tapered stinger is placed just below the DNR at the end of your drill string.  The stinger eliminates any bit costs during the reamer operation as it is run without a bit offering you a much better indication of hole conditions.  Floats are included in the stinger, as well as, an anti-plug port system with both of these features eliminating any plugging of the drill string.  With no bit on the stinger, the drill string will find and keep well bore center preventing unplanned side tracks.
			

























PDC Bit Repair | SDPI - Superior Drilling Products







































































PDC Bit Re‑Manufacturing














PDC Bit Re‑Manufacturing

 Superior Drilling Products, Inc. created the industry’s first commercially viable PDC bit remanufacturing process in the industry, and has emerged as the industry standard.
We have performed this service exclusively for Baker Hughes for over 18 years. We currently service all of the Baker Hughes Rocky Mountain Region, and are gaining share in oil-producing regions in California and Alaska.
Today, we continue to lead the industry in drill bit repair technology; continually improving repair techniques that enhance drill bit performance and efficiency.









One-of-a-Kind Process
SDPI invented the unique process used today to re-manufacture drill bits using specials techniques and tools to ensure the integrity of the bit.


Superior Quality
SDPI's unique re-manufacturing methods reflect our attitude about quality. Quality is checked every step of the re-manufacturing process to ensure bits are up the Superior standard.


Cuting Edge Facilites
SDPI is always looking to find a better way of performing our work. Our operations are housed in custom built facilities with the focus being efficiency, safety, and beauty.

























History | SDPI - Superior Drilling Products






































































Sdpi History









Superior Drilling Products, Inc (SDPI) was founded in 1993 by our CEO, Troy Meier.  Before establishing SDPI, Mr. Meier worked for Christensen Diamond Products in Salt Lake City.  While at Christensen he designed and opened manufacturing facilities in Ireland, China, and Venezuela.  Baker Hughes acquired Christensen in 1992 and formed Hughes Christensen.  Shortly thereafter, SDPI was formed and developed the first commercially viable process to remanufacture PDC drill bits in Vernal, Utah.  As of 2016, SDPI continues to repair PDC bits for Baker Hughes at its technologically advanced PDC repair facility near its corporate headquarters in Vernal.
In May of 2014, SDPI purchased Hard Rock Solutions, Inc (HRSI) and became a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. (NYSE:SDPI)  The purchase of HRSI included the patented Drill-n-Ream tool which conditions horizontal well bores while drilling.  The dual operation of conditioning and drilling saves oil and gas operators significant time and money.
Drilling horizontal wells can be challenging and complex with increased technical demands.  To overcome these demands, SDPI is continuing its history of innovation by also offering a drill string oscillation tool called Strider.  All research and development and manufacturing for SDPI products is done at sophisticated state-of-the-art facilities in Vernal.

Current SDPI Stock Info




 


Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (ticker: SDPI) anticipates that its revenue will be as much as four times higher for Q2, 2017 than it was for the same quarter in 2016, the company said in a statement yesterday.
Troy Meier, Chairman and CEO of Superior Drilling Products, attributed the growth to “increasing market penetration and deployment of [the company’s] flagship Drill-N-Ream® (DnR) well bore conditioning tool.”
Meier also noted that a higher industry-utilization of its drilling tools is leading to higher volumes in its tool refurbishment business. The higher tool use and tool refurbishment levels prompted Superior Drilling Technologies to raise its full-year revenue estimate by 20% at the midpoint of the year.
The estimate was raised to between $14 million and $16 million, up from the previous $12 to $13 million.
The company also announced that its domestic market channel partner, Drilling Tools International, Inc.—which markets the Superior Drilling Products’ Drill-N-Ream® system, exceeded its 10% market share goal for the DnR product on horizontal rigs in the U.S. and Canada. Drilling Tools International is also on track to raise that value to 12.5% by the end of 2017.
Superior Drilling Products, Inc. is presenting at EnerCom’s The Oil & Gas Conference® 22
Superior Drilling Products will be a presenting company at the upcoming EnerCom conference in Denver, Colorado—The Oil & Gas Conference® 22.
The conference is EnerCom’s 22nd Denver-based oil and gas focused investor conference, bringing together publicly traded E&Ps and oilfield service and technology companies with institutional investors.  The conference will be at the Denver Downtown Westin Hotel, August 13-17, 2017.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

First Quarter 2017 Revenue More than Doubles to $3.4 millionBusiness WireMay 12, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareVERNAL, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE MKT: SDPI) (“SDP” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of drilling tool technologies, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.Troy Meier, Chairman and CEO, noted, "We demonstrated the strength of our operations and ability to efficiently meet measurably increased orders in the quarter. Our largest customer has been building their Drill-N-Ream® well bore conditioning tool inventory to address growing demand and to achieve their market share goals. Important highlights included: We addressed the measurable increase in demand and demonstrated the significant leverage gained on that volume. Our DPM Optimization (Design, Programming, and Machining) contributed to this ability to ramp up as rapidly as we did.  The value of our Drill-N-Ream is being realized by a continually growing number of operators, with more beginning to use multiple tools of various sizes on a single well in their drilling processes. The tool improves penetration rates, helps rotary steerable systems around the curve and off bottom, reduces shock and vibrations thereby improving MWD (measurement-while-drilling) tool life.  We commercialized the Coiled Tubing Strider (CTS) that incorporates our patented StriderTM oscillation system technology. While revenue was modest and costs are still high, market reception has been very positive.  Our review of market channel opportunities for the CTS is advancing as we also consider interim approaches to getting the tool to market.  We continue to advance the Open Hole Strider with innovative materials that can withstand abrasive drilling fluids. We expect to commercialize this tool later in 2017. We are very encouraged with the reception of the technologies we have brought to market and believe, in time, there will be additional solutions we can develop to advance drilling efficiencies.”First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary  ($ in thousands,except per share amounts)                   Q1 2017           Q1 2016            Y/Y Change             Y/Y % Change            Q4 2016            Seq.

Sequentially, revenue was up 44% over the trailing fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of continued increases in drilling activity and market share gains in the first quarter.Tool revenue improved to $2.3 million, an increase of 138% over the prior-year period and 27% higher than the trailing fourth quarter. Tool sales/rental revenue was comprised primarily of tool sales, whereas in the first quarter of 2016 this revenue was from tool rentals. The Company changed its go-to-market and business strategy in May 2016. Higher tool revenue was the result of increased rig activity and growing market share. Combined, this drove tool sales, tool usage and repair activity.Contract services were $1.1 million, up 125% over the prior-year period, outpacing a 34% increase in rig counts over the same period. When compared with the trailing fourth quarter, contract services revenue doubled while rig counts increased just 26%.Net loss of $386 thousand improved 83% over the prior-year period. Higher revenue combined with the significant changes in the Company’s business model and the inherent operating leverage on higher volume led to stronger revenue conversion.First Quarter 2017 Operational Review   ($ in thousands)                        Q1 2017           Q1 2016            Y/Y Change             Y/Y % Change            Q4 2016           Seq.

For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA improved $1.5 million over prior-year period and $0.8 million over the trailing fourth quarter due primarily to the Company’s innovative technology coupled with the improving oil & gas industry. The Company believes that when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its operating performance. (1)See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding SDP’s use of adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA.Balance Sheet and LiquidityCash and equivalents was $1.0 million at March 31, 2017, down from $2.2 million at the end of 2016. Cash used in operations was $0.8 million, more than the $0.3 million in the prior-year period. The higher requirement for cash was mostly related to an increase in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable were up $1.6 million due to the increase in sales and timing of receipts.Total debt at the end of the quarter was $14.0 million, down $2.7 million, or 16%, compared with $16.7 million at December 31, 2016.Proceeds of $2.5 million from the sale of non-core real estate property on February 9, 2017, were used for the repayment of related borrowings. The property was purchased in a related-party transaction by Superior Auto Body and Paint, LLC (“SABP”), an entity in which the Meiers have a direct ownership interest.Read MoreDuring the quarter, the Company had capital expenditures of $133 thousand, primarily related to the conversion from lease to own for machining centers.Financial estimates for 2017:  Revenue:               Approximately $12.0 to $13.0 million     Operating margin, excluding amortization:         9% to 11%     Depreciation:         $1.3 to $1.4 million     Amortization:         Approximately $2.4 million     Interest Expense:         Approximately $950 thousand     Capital Expenditures:         Approximately $350 thousand        Webcast and Conference CallThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast today at 10:00 am MT (12:00 pm ET) to review the financial and operating results for the quarter and discuss its corporate strategy and outlook.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure of operating performance and uses it to assess performance and inform operating decisions. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP financial measure. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures of performance, including net cash provided by operations, operating income and net income. The Company’s method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may vary substantially from the methods used by other companies and investors are cautioned not to rely unduly on it.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170512005108/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump names John F.

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $24,030,000 million from sale
of our common stock in this offering, (a) assuming an initial public offering
price of $4.00 per share and (b) after deducting estimated expenses payable by
us and underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2,970,000
million.

We initially intend to use a portion of the initial net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

. Hard Rock Acquisition down payment:   To pay the $12.5 million due at 
  closing of the Hard Rock acquisition immediately after closing of this 
  offering.  

. Tronco Loan Purchase and Related Loan Payoffs:  

. To acquire from the lender the approximately $6.9 million promissory note, 
  and approximately $1.3 million deferred interest obligation, owed by Tronco 
  Energy Corporation, a Meier-related entity (together, the “Tronco Loan”). 
  The deferred interest obligation does not bear interest and is due in full 
  at payoff of the note. 

. To create a public market for our securities and increase our visibility 
  in the marketplace. A public market for our securities will facilitate 
  future access to public equity markets and enhance our ability to use our 
  securities as a means of attracting and retaining key employees and as 
  consideration for acquisitions.  

. To use the balance of the net proceeds from this offering for general 
  corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, working capital, 
  sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and 
  capital expenditures. As of the date of this prospectus, however, we cannot 
  specify all of the particular uses for the working capital portion of the 
  proceeds from this offering and will have broad discretion to direct their 
  use.  

The following chart summarizes our anticipated use proceeds at this time:

OFFERING TOTAL                                                 $       27,000,000  
Hard Rock acquisition down payment                             $       12,500,000

Tronco loan purchase (estimated)                               $        8,307,500

Other working capital and corporate purposes                   $          422,500  

In addition, if the Underwriters elect to exercise their over-allotment 
options, we intend to use a portion of those proceeds as follows: 

. To repay the approximately $700,000 owed under a commercial line of credit 
  made to SDP in order to make required annual payments on the Tronco loan. 
  This loan bears interest at 7%, and has a maturity of November 2014.  

. To repay the approximately $2 million owed under three loans made to the 
  Meiers personally to make required annual payments on the Tronco Loan. 
  These loans bear interest at 3.25% to 7.88%, and have a maturity dates of 
  2036 – 2037.

advantage is demonstrated by both our significantly superior production times,
according to reports we have received from Baker Hughes regarding their in-house
production times, as well as our client’s continuing requests for us to take
over or manage the work currently being done by those in-house units.

Other drill bit manufacturers also have in-house remanufacturing units, but they
are not our competitors since we have an exclusive contract with Baker Hughes.

Drill String Tools. The primary competitors for our Drill N Ream tool are
several single-section reaming tool manufacturers, including Baker Oil Tools (a
division of Baker Hughes), NOV, and Schlumberger each priced between
$15,000 – $30,000 per unit on a rental basis for each run. However, we believe
that the Drill N Ream tool is the only dual-section or dual cutting structure
drill string reamer on the market today. It is priced at $20,000 to $25,000 per
unit per run, with most runs extending for five to ten thousand feet. We believe
that distinction will allow us to continue building on the Drill N Ream tool’s
first-mover advantage once we complete our acquisition of Hard Rock upon closing
of this offering. We believe that our other pending drill string tools are at
the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal
drilling. Consequently, potential competitors who may be developing similar
technology are currently unknown. There are existing tools that would compete
with the drill string stimulation tool, such as the Agitator tool marketed by
NOV. However, we believe our technology in the drill string stimulation tool
offers significant advantages over the Agitator and we believe will be rapidly
accepted in the drilling market.


Company Description
We are an innovative, cutting-edge remanufacturer of PDC (polycrystalline 
diamond compact) drill bits, and a designer and manufacturer of new drill bit 
and horizontal drill string enhancement tools for the oil, natural gas and 
mining services industry. We currently operate four basic lines of


 business: 

. Our PDC drill bit remanufacturing service exclusively for Baker Hughes,

. Our Drill N Ream tool division that will be merged with Hard Rock Solutions, 
  LLC (“Hard Rock”), and serve as our drilling tool marketing and distribution 
  arm after our pending acquisition of Hard Rock upon closing of this offering,

. Our emerging technologies business that manufactures the Drill N Ream tool, 
  our new drill bits, custom drill tool products to customer specifications, 
  and our innovative pending drill string enhancement tools, and

. Our new product development business that conducts our research and 
  development, and designs our new drill bits, horizontal drill string 
  enhancement tools, other down-hole drilling technologies, and drilling tool 
  manufacturing technologies.

From our headquarters in Vernal, Utah, we operate a technologically advanced PDC
drill bit remanufacturing facility, as well as a state-of-the-art, high-tech
drill tool machining facility. We manufacture our drill string enhancement
tools, including the patent pending “Drill N Ream” well bore enhancement tool,
and conduct our new product research and development from this facility. We
believe that we continue to set the trend in oil and gas drill bit and drill
string tool technology and design.

Our co-founder, Troy Meier, developed the first commercially-viable process to
remanufacture PDC drill bits after a successful 13-year career with a
predecessor of our largest client, Baker Hughes, the world’s fifth largest
oilfield services company. For the past 18 years, we have serviced the Rocky
Mountain, California and Alaska regions exclusively for Baker Hughes’s
substantial oil field operations. We continuously work with our customers to
develop new products and enhancements, improve efficiency and safety, and solve
complex drilling tool problems. We employ a senior work force with special
training and extensive experience related to drill bit remanufacturing and
tooling manufacture. They produce our products and services using a suite of
highly technical, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and
manufacture for our proprietary use. Most of our manufacturing equipment and
products use advanced, patent-pending technologies that enable us to increase
efficiency, enhance drill bit integrity, and improve safety.

Recently, challenging new horizontal oil and gas well designs and construction
have substantially increased the technical demands on drill bit and drill string
components. To respond to this horizontal drilling challenge, we collaborated
with Hard Rock Solutions, Inc. (“HRSI”). HRSI designed the Drill N Ream well
bore conditioning tool in 2011 (“Drill N Ream”). The Drill N Ream tool is a
dual-section reaming tool which is located behind the bottom hole assembly
(“BHA”) of the drill string to smooth and slightly enlarge the well bore in the
curved and horizontal sections of horizontal wells, in both oil and water based
mud. The Drill N Ream tool is available in multiple sizes and can be custom
manufactured to fit any hole size. The Drill N Ream tool allows the drill string
to move through a conditioned well bore left by the drill bit with less friction
and material stress, extending the horizontal distance that can be drilled 
during a run and making tripping (removal of the drill string) and the running 
of casing in the completed well much easier. Each time a drilling operator has 
to retract a drill string and replace a bit or other drill string component, 
it costs the operator substantial time and money, so we believe anything that 
allows each run to extend further is of great value to our customers. As a 
result, the Drill N Ream tool is now in use in over 850 well drilling 
operations, which we believe indicates significant initial industry acceptance 
in a fairly short period of time. We are also developing a suite of other 
horizontal drill string tools, each of which addresses a different technical 
challenge presented by today’s horizontal drilling designs. 

Under our existing agreement with HRSI, we produce the Drill N Ream tools and 
HRSI markets them to well operators on a rental basis. This arrangement 
allows the well operator to switch out Drill N Ream tools when theirs becomes 
dull, and HRSI then returns the dull tools to us for refurbishing. We now have 
the opportunity to purchase HRSI’s interest in the Drill N Ream tool rental 
business, including the Drill N Ream inventory, rental arrangements, customer 
lists, contract employees, facilities and its owner’s 50% interest in the 
patents pending relating to the Drill N Ream. Before closing our acquisition, 
HRSI will move those assets into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hard Rock 
Solutions, LLC. We intend to use a portion of the offering proceeds to complete 
our purchase of Hard Rock, at which time we will operate Hard Rock as our 
wholly-owned subsidiary. 

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis 
of the quality and reliability of our products and services, our proprietary 
technology, and our ability to rapidly respond with products that meet the 
most demanding and changing needs of our customers.
