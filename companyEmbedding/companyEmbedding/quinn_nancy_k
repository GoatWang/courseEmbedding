Tippie College of BusinessBBABBACertificationsSCRUMScrum AllianceRecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Nancy:Nancy is simply one of the best I’ve worked with in my career - a big thinker who remains approachable and supportive. She is a great coach and partner, and I love her direct but kind style of communication. This is why Nancy was able to come into Ticketmaster day one and build business relationships that other people weren’t able to and is ultimately why Nancy remains so well respected in the company today. 

Nancy is in a class by herself when it comes to playing the dual role of functional expert, AND contribute as a leader setting business strategy.  There have been many projects and products that would have never seen the light of day if it hadn’t been for Nancy’s careful watch and diligence in advocating for tools that greatly improve how we do business. She is the kind of leader that people want to work with (and for) because not only is she focused on self-improvement and growth, but she makes the team better by enabling them to be their best selves in their daily work lives. She hires great people and sets a very high standard for performance and achievement.  Nancy knows how to get the best out of people and is one of the finest managers I’ve worked with in my career. She has been a tremendous support to me and helped provide me with guidance and support.  

Bonus – Nancy has got a terrific sense of humor and keeps even the tough tasks just a little bit fun.See moreSee lessNancy has become one of my favorite people to work with. With a sharp intelligence and focus-driven attitude, Nancy is undeniably a valuable asset to Ticketmaster. I have really enjoyed working with her on job aids she has needed for her team, and her enthusiastic and personable approach with co-workers is always refreshing. Her upbeat attitude permeates throughout the office; Nancy is always smiling and in a great mood.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended NancyView Nancy’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Nancy directlyView Nancy’s Full ProfileNot the Nancy you’re looking for?

Specialties of Quinn, Nancy K Lawyer:

Attorneys













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.
