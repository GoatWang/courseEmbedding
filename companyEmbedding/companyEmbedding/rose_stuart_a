Smith, Stuart S.-A River, Rose (P)-V/VN-OS - Product Information
A River, Rose by Stuart Saunders Smith is a unique work for violin and vibraphone duet.  The work is a "retelling" of the opening program note parable (which is to be spoken by one of the performers before playing the piece) in 5 different ways.  A very cerebral work, A River, Rose will be a piece that both the audience and performer will surely enjoy.Number of players - 2Difficulty - AdvancedInstrumentaiton - Violin, Vibraphone
