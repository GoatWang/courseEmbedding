Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Personal Accounts

We begin the process by analyzing your unique investment objectives and constraints to arrive at a customized Investment Policy Statement. We consider your time horizon, liquidity needs, tax situation, as well as any legal or other specific circumstances during this process. We implement your unique investment plan and report back to you, making sure that we consider your needs as they change from time to time. We encourage frequent personal contact to assure your highest possible comfort level with the implementation of your investment plan.









Retirement Accounts
We work with you to establish a reasonable plan for achieving your retirement goals. We implement the plan for you, making sure that it remains on track during your contribution phase, then assist you in arriving at a sustainable withdrawal plan at the time that funds are needed. As this dynamic process evolves through time, we encourage frequent re-visiting of your plan’s progress with respect to your stated goals. Furthermore, we help you adhere to Federal and State regulations to assure that your plan stays within the complex laws that govern retirement accounts.









Trusts and Estates

We work with you or your designated fiduciary to make sure that the managed portfolio adheres to the trust document or Will. We provide an investment perspective to the trust and estate management process that assists in determining liquidity needs and balancing the conflicting needs of different classes of beneficiaries.









Non-Profit Organizations

To satisfy the unique needs of Non-Profit Funds and Endowments, we encourage and assist in the development and implementation of a formal Investment Policy Statement, so as to provide continuity as Trustees move on and off the Board. We provide expanded reporting and customized presentations to make sure Trustees are familiar with the Investment Policy Statement and our implementation of them.

Our History
Many of our values at Ramsay, Stattman, Vela & Price, Inc. have been shaped by our firm’s inspiring founder: Robert H. Ramsay, whose passion was working with individuals’ investments and establishing long-term client relationships. The cornerstone of his investment philosophy was that growth was an essential component of nearly all portfolios, and this notion guides us still today.
Known for his wisdom and expertise as a portfolio manager, Ramsay was sought out for advice on personal as well as professional matters. He was also a valued civic leader, serving on the boards of numerous local non-profit organizations including the Joseph Henry Edmondson Foundation, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Penrose Hospital, and the Colorado Outward Bound School.
In 1971, Ramsay founded his own investment firm, Robert H. Ramsay Financial Services, in the same building where we still conduct our business today. He possessed a vision for the firm’s longevity from its very beginning, and he also had a knack for attracting outstanding individuals to his team.
In 1989, Robert Ramsay hired Steven R. Vela to work with him after Steve completed his MBA in Finance at Southern Methodist University. For Steve, that opportunity gave him the chance to return to Colorado Springs, where he grew up and attended Colorado College.
Despite their nearly 40-year age difference, Ramsay treated Steve equally and entrusted him with a great deal of responsibility, mentoring him in his new role and also sharing with him the values of a long-term investment approach, community service, and client confidentiality. Ramsay’s approach held consistent as he added his future business partners.
In 1990, Frederick B. Stattman joined the firm in Colorado Springs after working as a financial counselor in the New Jersey office of Asset Management Group. With an MBA in Finance from Columbia University, Fred came to the firm with the desire to focus his career on managing individual investment accounts.
Philip S. Price joined the firm in 1995 after serving as a portfolio manager for Banc One Investment Advisors, where he managed portfolios for individuals, trusts and foundations.
As continuity and consistency for his clients were important to Ramsay, in 1997 he tasked Stattman, Vela, and Price with formulating a plan for taking over ownership of the business, and when the trio shared their proposal with him, he amicably accepted their plan. But, in true Ramsay fashion, he also adjusted the terms so that the transition would occur within a shorter timeframe and be more beneficial to the new business owners.
In 2009, John W. Herdje joined Ramsay, Stattman, Vela, & Price, Inc. as managing director of the firm’s Princeton, New Jersey office, bringing with him great depth of experience in managing investments for individuals, trusts, and private foundations, most recently with Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
Even though our founder Bob Ramsay no longer lives and works with us, we strive to uphold his vision for our firm and act upon the guiding principles that continue to shape the future of Ramsay, Stattman, Vela, & Price, Inc.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter
