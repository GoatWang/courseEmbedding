Keeps logging me out all day long so im here thinking nothing is happening at home since i haven't gotten no notifications but i go and check and its logged out.... over & over again. Plus ots really hard to work with.   Full Review                    John Hall  April 30, 2017                         Camera cycles off and on randomly every few minutes. App had worked, now images show up in device list but not when clicked on. Used to work ok, minus the camera cycling. Now just sucks all around   Full Review                    Elisabeth Matt  March 2, 2017                         I love the camera, but the app is terrible! It has sporadically deleted the camera from its memory, then claimed the correct password was incorrect (I know this because I put the password in, was told it was incorrect, then restarted the app several times and tried repeatedly with the same password, only to have it work on the third or fourth try). If it actually kept the camera information and stayed logged on, this would be a five star review. If the two would stay connected, all the features would work great!   Full Review                    Heather Evans  December 11, 2016                        App is garbage. This app crashes at least 3 times a day!! Especially at night when we are trying to get to sleep and keep an eye/ear on our sleeping baby. We wake up frequently with a baby screaming and not knowing how long he has been crying because the app decided to crash ! Terrible app for an awesome camera. Fix the issues!!!!   Full Review                    Kailey Oppenheim  December 28, 2016                        Features needed + bugs - Cannot delete more than one video or image at a time. Sometimes I will have hundreds per day! Very time consuming.           - Clicking on a video or image to view will display the wrong one.                    - lots of buffering when it does work.                  - lots of connection time out errors.      - Two way sound works very nicely.                                                                ***Will update rating when new update is released with less bugs.

No ability to add another device with the + mark   Full Review                    Adam Newbloom  January 17, 2017                         I don't have the option to add devices on the top left (like instructions say) so of my two cameras I only see one.  How do I fix that?   Full Review                    Heather Cummins  March 31, 2017                         This app is ok. It's really not very well designed. Please please please make it so that I can delete more than one video/snapshot at the time. I have it set up on motion detection to take a video and a asnapahot. It preforms well, but my goodness... if a left blows in the wind it picks up the movement then takes multiple snapshots. I have at least 100-300 videos and snapshots per day from movement.  The sensitivity is set generally low (around 20-30).   Also, I have issues of it timing out when I first open the app.   I cannot record 24/7. I can set the option up, and everything appears to work, but when I try to view the recordings it shows no videos found. This would be much easier to record 24/7 rather than all the snapshots and videos.   Please fix!!!   Full Review                    Birftard Johnson  February 15, 2017                         Works fine, so I decided to buy another.  But i don't see the "add another device" setting on the app like it shows on the manual.  I can only connect to my original camera.   Full Review                    Enkelejd Begollari  December 26, 2016                         When using the app you just get the "Connection Timeout" error every other minute or the app just freezes and then crashes. I've been using this app for 5 months now and there hasn't been any updates to address these bugs.   Full Review                    Jeremy Morris  July 16, 2017                         App working on my up to date Android as of July 16.  My wife put the camera under the couch and got a cats eye view of how they spend their day.  I watched from work, not sure what more people want.   Full Review                    Shari Brown  December 2, 2016                        This is crap Worked for a few days and quit. You can't use the app if your not in WiFi range. That means you can't see your camera or what's going on while you're away. What's the point? The instructions are not helpful at all. I am returning this camera.   Full Review                    L.M. Giordano  April 26, 2017                         This worked well before, but now, I cannot view anything when I travel. Worthless! Upgrade seemed to take away my option to check on my pet when I'm traveling.   Full Review                    Devin Miller  June 25, 2017                         No support for it's own Pan/Tilt/Zoom cameras? Have to load up web interface if I want to move the camera. Which makes the app non-functional for me.

Full Review                    Brian Czajkowski  February 14, 2017                         works great   Full Review                    Chris Asbury  August 19, 2016                        Terrible app When it works, it's great, but only works 20% of the time. Saved videos are often grey, so you can't see anything. The motion capture often doesn't work. Saved videos usually don't play or even play the wrong video. It renders the device basically useless. I might even return the camera, even though the camera seems to work well. But you need the app to use the camera, so it's useless.   Full Review                    Crystal Skiba  May 11, 2016                        Good concept poor execution This is a genius idea and when it works it's great. However this app crashes constantly. It freezes and has error messages that cause you to restart your phone and log in again.I've had to do this at least 5 times a day.   Full Review                    Robert Durham  July 7, 2016                        Needs more work App does not support other cameras sold by HooToo.  If you only have or need one camera it may work for you.  Not a fan.  Crashes frequently.

I cannot setup the camera to a wireless connection with the app. Luckily my wife has an iPhone 6 that could. Once added, the camera works well. My phone is a Verizon samsung s6 edge on marshmallow.   Full Review                    em bad  June 20, 2016                        This app really sucks It's glitchy it does not send you notification unless you're on the same network. You basically have to be at your house or your office with the app actually I'm looking at it, if your phone screen goes off you won't receive any notification.
