About us



      ABOUT US
    

      At Eniac Ventures we lead seed rounds in bold founders who use code to create transformational companies. Armed with over 80 years of combined experience building our own companies, we are your active partners and consider ourselves a member of your founding team. Providing capital is just the first step, when we lead your seed round we provide the industry’s most comprehensive support through our Eniac Platform and hands on approach.
We're hiring a PR Manager. Click to learn more!






      INVESTMENT PROFILE
    


        We Lead Seed Rounds in Bold Founders Who Use Code to Create Transformational Companies
      

         In the future, the way we interact with technology will be drastically different, all the screens people currently interact with will disappear and be replaced by more humanistic and natural interfaces. Instead of tapping on a phone, you might message with friends using gestures and voice and receive replies in augmented reality. We think of this as a new era of seamless computing and it is why we are especially interested in funding: Conversational UIs, Robotics, VR/AR, and Software Disrupting Mature Industries. We see artificial intelligence as a layer that will power all these sectors.

  
Because the partners all have a strong technical background, we look for founders who not only have the vision, but also the chops to build the best products, and the grit required to power through the ups and downs. We generally look for companies we believe can take a monopolistic position in their market. We also have to believe the founder is uniquely positioned to exploit a highly attractive market in terms of competition, size, growth rate and timing.  
      

        The Eniac Platform
      

       From the beginning one of the keys to Eniac’s success has been taking a holistic approach to supporting our portfolio. With Eniac you get four partners for the price of one, and each partner uses their unique experience to open doors and advise our investments. The result has led to companies that consistently bring quality product to market, find follow on investment and have a measurable impact across industries.
With each fund our approach has evolved and expanded to address the growing needs of our portfolio companies. We want our founders to focus on their product, so we created the Eniac Platform. Term sheets are just the first step, working with Eniac companies enjoy the following support: 
Talent recruiter to find the best employees, especially in engineering
Public relations and marketing specialist on staff to help your product reach the audiences that matter from launch through growth
Operations resources to organize your staff and install best practices
Business development and networking opportunities with thousands of the top companies, investors, and brands
Connections to other founders in Eniac’s portfolio to explore synergies and opportunities  
Fundraising support including pitch deck guidance, follow on investor strategy, and syndicate building







Team



      WHO WE ARE
    

 Although Eniac Ventures began investing in 2010, the roots trace back to four like-minded University of Pennsylvania students over two decades ago. After college our partners set out on separate but parallel paths as serial entrepreneurs but maintained a strong bond and network of support. Today our combined 80 years of experience building over a dozen companies, and our belief in a strong community are at the heart and soul of our investment approach.

Hadley Harris
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER


        Hadley has done a little bit of everything on the path to co-founding Eniac. Starting as an engineer at Pegasystems, he later took on roles as a product manager at Microsoft and strategist at Samsung, where it became clear that big companies were not for him.

In 2007 he was very fortunate to join a very talented AI team out of MIT at Vlingo where he ran a few aspects of the business across product and marketing until it was sold to Nuance for $225M. He rolled his experience building a successful startup into Thumb where as CMO he helped the real-time recommendation app reach user engagement levels second only to Facebook before being acquired. 

Hadley grew up in downtown Boston, which shaped his lifelong love of science, hip hop and the New England Patriots.  Outside the office Hadley enjoys jogging, meditating, mixing music and traveling the world. 
Hadley is passionate about improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which stems from his close relationship with his brother Traves.  He is a development board member for Cardinal Cushing Centers where Traves was a student and current member of its adult program.
  
Hadley is still paying off student loans for his MBA from Wharton and bachelors in Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.

Nihal Mehta
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER

        At Eniac we call Nihal the human rolodex, thanks to the thousands of connections he has made with some of world’s top companies and brands. He developed many of these connections over the past 20 years while founding five different high tech startups. Most recently Nihal was the founding CEO of LocalResponse, where he grew revenues 2153% in three years and landed them at number 204 in the 2014 INC. 5000’s Fastest Growing Companies. Prior to LocalResponse, Nihal founded buzzd, the first real-time mobile cityguide, and ipsh!, one of the first full-service mobile marketing agencies in 2001, which was acquired by Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) in 2005.
  
Even before founding Eniac, Nihal honed his ability to spot top entrepreneurial talent by investing in Admob (acquired by Google), Swiftkey (acquired by Microsoft), Tala, Tapad (acquired by Telenor), and Uber to name a few. Because of his experience both building and funding top technologies, he frequently guest lectures at business schools around the country on entrepreneurship and mobile marketing, and is published in over 15 books and white papers on the subject. 
  
Outside of the office Nihal loves to spend time with his wife Reshma and is a big supporter of her non-profit Girls Who Code. Around town you will usually see him with his son Shaan and beagle-bulldog Stanley. Nihal is the life of the party, which is why he always spearheads Eniac events. 
  
Nihal graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Philosophy and a BSE in Computer Science.

Tim Young
FOUNDING GENERAL PARTNER

        The partners call Tim the closer because of his ability to find the best partners and close rounds for our portfolio companies. Prior to co-founding Eniac, Tim honed this skill over 20 years investing and building his own companies. In 2001, Tim founded Bridge, an enterprise software company focused on corporate training in Beijing, China, which he led to an 8-figure exit. Prior to Bridge, Tim led product at Quoteship which exited to Logistics.com  (NASDAQ: ICGE).  He also worked for ExxonMobil as a developer and Mofo where he advised startups on IP and financing.
  
During his downtime, you can find Tim exploring the mountains or oceans. He has found a way to combine his passions for travel and waves, having surfed on five continents and plans to sail to Hawaii in the upcoming Pacific Cup.
  
Tim started as an engineer and earned his BSE in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received the Bristol-Myers Squibb award for his work in cancer research. Tim also returned to earn a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Anna Ring
HEAD OF PLATFORM
  
Anna has worked in business operations for over a decade, using her broad background in finance, human resources, and administration management to help companies grow. She has overseen growth from just a handful of employees to over 100, all while keeping chaos at bay with proactive strategies.
  
In addition to keeping things running smoothly at Eniac Ventures, Anna provides vital support to our portfolio companies by establishing processes, operational systems, and implementing best practices. 
  
When Anna is not improving systems and processes, you can find her hiking in the Bay Area or deadlifting at the gym. In the evenings Anna turns to her passion for gastronomy and is either exploring new restaurants or throwing dinner parties. 
  
Anna moved from Europe to California in 2004 for college and she graduated from University of California Santa Cruz with a BA in Business Management Economics. Back then she promised her family she would only be gone for 4 years, but it’s now been over 12 years thanks to the charm of the San Francisco Bay Area.
