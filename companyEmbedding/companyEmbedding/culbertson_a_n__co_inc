A Letter From Alan Culbertson
Chairman & CEO
We offer wealth management services to affluent Clients who seek guidance in aligning their financial and personal/family goals to achieve financial freedom and the peace of mind that comes with it. As an independent fee-based wealth management firm, we create and manage customized equity and fixed income portfolios for financially successful individuals and their families. In addition, we develop and maintain comprehensive financial plans to give Clients a strategic roadmap for their future. We also work closely with a team of experts to help Clients have ready access to counsel in such areas as risk management, estate planning and tax planning.
Each investor is different. You bring a unique set of needs and circumstances as you pursue management of your funds. In addition to growing your assets, you may need to obtain tax-efficient returns, to preserve principal, or to transfer wealth to future generations. As a successful individual, you may find that you do not have the experience, training, or time to manage your own investments. We work with our Clients to understand their varying needs and customize solutions to meet their goals.
The firm seeks to minimize risk with a disciplined investment process that emphasizes fundamental research and strict valuation guidelines. Consideration of a Client’s investment objectives and risk tolerances is paramount, and the firm structures each portfolio to meet the Client’s distinct investment guidelines. We do not simply pick and choose stocks or bonds based on market price fluctuations; nor do we try to time the market. Rather, we follow a discipline of staying invested and diversified so Clients can take advantage of time in the market, instead of relying on timing the market.
We believe that we have a covenant with our Clients to help them achieve their most important lifetime financial goals—it is one that we honor and strive daily to merit through an objective and prudent approach.
We invite you to learn more about our unique approach to wealth management and our investment philosophy on the creation and preservation of wealth for our Clients.
Sincerely,

Alan N. Culbertson
Chairman and CEO

Our Process

HOW WE WORK WITH CLIENTS
Our process is grounded in our ability to fully understand the client’s needs and knowing their most important financial goals, challenges and values. This consultative approach is our framework for building and managing a long-term wealth management relationship with our clients.
The Discovery Meeting
Our first meeting is designed for us to learn about your goals, values, assets, interests, important family relationships and how involved you like to be in the overall wealth management process. You will be asked to bring information to this meeting that helps us assess your overall financial situation. There will be plenty of time during this meeting for you to help us better understand you.
The Investment Plan Statement
Two weeks after the Discovery meeting we will present an investment plan to you that incorporates the information we have gathered during your Discovery meeting. We will explain the recommended asset allocation plan that we feel is appropriate for you.   This meeting usually lasts for an hour. We will not ask you to make a commitment to retain us at this time, but rather to get back to us in about a week after you have had time to consider the relationship and think about the investment plan and our firm.
Mutual Commitment Meeting
If you wish to retain us and we wish to work with you, then it will be at our third meeting that we commit to working together. We will then begin the necessary paperwork to retain our firm and to open accounts and transfer them to the broker we use for custody services.
Regular Progress Meetings
We will encourage you to come back and meet with us about 45 days after beginning our work together, and then on a periodic schedule that gives you comfort. Life is not predictable and neither are your finances. We will make adjustments where necessary to help you meet your goals.
The Wealth Management Plan
We will engage our outside experts as needed to create solutions for any challenges you might have in areas such as tax, legal, insurance, charitable gifting or other matters relating to your overall financial affairs.
We are always available to discuss this process. Please feel free to contact us anytime.

Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
