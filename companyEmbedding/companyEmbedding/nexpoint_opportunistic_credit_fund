The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland’s mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1. The Advisor has contractually agreed to limit the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to 0.90% of average daily net assets of the Fund. The expense cap will continue through at least October 31, 2017.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 3.50%.
Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by Highland to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities.” They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments.
Currency Risk. The risk that the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes  in the currency rates or exchange control regulations.
Debt Securities Risk. The Fund’s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings.
Derivatives Risk.  Derivatives, such as futures and options, are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. Derivative contracts may expire worthless and the use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund.
Non-Diversification Risk. As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund.
Non-Payment Risk. Senior Loans, like other corporate debt obligations, are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund.
Senior Loans Risk. The risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities in that they are considered speculative. In addition, as with any debt instrument, senior loans are also generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in prevailing interest rates. Senior loans are also subject to the risk that, as interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, which may also increase the risk and rate of default. In addition, the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in short-term interest rates; long term interest rates can vary dramatically from short term interest rates. Therefore, senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising long-term interest rate environment.

	PROXY STATEMENT




	ANNUAL
	MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS




	JUNE 2, 2017



	This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Trustees of NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund, a
	Delaware statutory trust (the Fund), for use at the Funds Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 300 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Madrone Conference Room, Dallas, Texas 75201, on Friday, June 2, 2017, at 8:00 a.m. Central
	Time, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof (the Annual Meeting), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders dated April 27, 2017. The Fund is a closed-end management
	investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). NexPoint Advisors, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (NexPoint or the Adviser), with its principal office at
	200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201, serves as the investment adviser and the administrator to the Fund. The Funds principal executive office is located at 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201.


	This Proxy Statement and the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and form of proxy are being provided to shareholders on or about
	April 27, 2017. The Board of Trustees (the Board) has fixed the close of business on April 21, 2017 as the record date (the Record Date) for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and to
	vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 16,038,917 shares of the Funds common shares (Common Shares), par value $0.001 per share, were issued and outstanding, and the Fund had not issued any preferred shares.
	Shareholders of the Fund are entitled to one vote for each Fund share held and fractional votes for each fractional Fund share held.


	If the form of proxy
	is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Annual Meeting, the shares covered thereby will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. All properly executed proxies received by the Board that
	do not specify how shares should be voted will be voted (i) 

	FOR

	the election as a Trustee of the nominees listed in Proposal 1, (ii) 

	FOR

	the approval of a change to the Funds fundamental policy
	regarding concentration listed in Proposal 2, and (iii) in the discretion of the persons named as proxies in connection with any other matter which may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponements thereof. The
	Proposals are separate and independent; the outcome of voting by Shareholders of the Fund on one Proposal does not affect the outcome for the other Proposal.


	The Board does not know of any matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. A shareholder may revoke his
	or her proxy by appearing at the Annual Meeting, revoking his or her proxy and voting in person, giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Fund or by returning a later-dated proxy before the Annual Meeting.


	The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Fund entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum (Quorum) for
	the Funds Annual Meeting. If a Quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, or if a Quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve the Proposals are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments or
	postponements of the Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any adjournment or postponement will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares that are represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, whether
	or not a Quorum is present.


	 


	1






	Shares represented by properly executed proxies with respect to which (i) a vote is withheld, (ii) the
	shareholder abstains, or (iii) a broker does not vote (i.e., broker non-votes) will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a Quorum. Assuming the presence of a Quorum, abstentions and
	broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against each Proposal.


	In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, the Funds officers
	and employees of the Adviser may solicit proxies by web, by telephone or in person. Copies of the Notice for the Annual Meeting, the Proxy Statement and the form of proxy are available at www.proxyonline.com/docs/nexpointcsf2017.pdf. The Fund has
	engaged AST Fund Solutions, LLC at 48 Wall Street, 21

	st

	Floor, New York, NY 10005 for inquiries, to provide shareholder meeting services, including the distribution of this Proxy Statement and
	related materials to shareholders as well as assisting the Fund in soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting at an approximate cost of $70,000. The costs of proxy solicitation and expenses incurred in connection with preparing this Proxy Statement
	and its enclosures will be paid by the Fund.






	PROPOSAL 1




	ELECTION OF TRUSTEES



	The Funds
	Board is currently composed of five Trustees, four of whom are not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in the 1940 Act) (the Independent Trustees). The remaining Trustee, Mr. Powell, is currently treated as an
	interested person of the Fund (an Interested Trustee). Mr. Powell is treated as an Interested Trustee because of his previous positions with affiliates of the Adviser and the possibility that he may provide consulting
	services to affiliates of the Adviser. At the Annual Meeting, the holders of the Funds Common Shares are being asked to re-elect Dr. Bob Froehlich and Timothy K. Hui as Class II Trustees of the Fund, to serve for a three-year term until
	the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders or until his respective successor is duly elected and qualified. Dr. Froehlich and Mr. Hui are currently serving as Class II Trustees of the Fund and have agreed to continue to serve as Class II
	Trustees, if re-elected. If Dr. Froehlich and Mr. Hui are not available for re-election at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote for such substitute nominee(s) as the Funds Governance Committee may
	select.


	The Funds Board is divided into three classes with the term of office of one class expiring each year. Dr. Bob Froehlich and Timothy
	K. Hui are currently serving as Class II Trustees. Dr. Froehlich and Mr. Hui were last elected to serve a three year term at the annual meeting of shareholders held on June 6, 2014. Ethan Powell and Bryan A. Ward are currently serving
	as Class I Trustees. Messrs. Powell and Ward were last elected to serve until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders at the Funds annual meeting of shareholders held on June 3, 2016. John Honis is currently serving as a Class III
	Trustee and was last elected to serve until the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders held on June 5, 2015. Dr. Froehlich and Mr. Hui will continue to serve as Class II Trustees if re-elected
	at the Annual Meeting. The Funds Trustees are not required to attend the Funds annual shareholder meetings. No Trustees attended the Funds annual meeting of shareholders held on June 3, 2016.



	Vote Required for Election of Trustees



	For a Class II
	Trustee of the Fund, the election requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares of the Fund, represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote for the election of a Trustee. Abstentions
	and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held in street name by brokers or nominees that indicate on their proxies that they do not have discretionary authority to vote such shares as to the election of a Trustee) are counted as
	present at the Annual Meeting but, assuming the presence of a Quorum, will have the effect of a vote against each nominee.

	THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE
	FOR THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES AS TRUSTEES.




	Qualifications and Additional Information about each Nominee for Trustee and the
	Continuing Trustees



	The following provides an overview of the considerations that led the Board to conclude that each individual nominee for Trustee
	or the individuals serving as continuing Trustees of the Fund should be nominated or so serve, as well as each nominees and each Trustees name and certain biographical information as reported by them to the Fund. Among the factors the
	Board considered when concluding that an individual should be a nominee for Trustee or serve on the Board were the following: the individuals experience, skills, expertise, education, knowledge, diversity, personal and professional integrity,
	character, business judgment, time availability in light of other commitments, dedication, the candidates ability to qualify as an Independent Trustee and the existence of any other relationships that might give rise to a conflict of interest
	and other relevant factors that the Funds Governance Committee considers appropriate in the context of the needs of the Board (e.g., whether a candidate is an audit committee financial expert under the federal securities laws).


	In respect of each Trustee nominee and each continuing Trustee, the individuals professional accomplishments and prior experience, including, in
	some cases, in fields related to the operations of the Fund, were a significant factor in the determination that the individual should be a nominee for Trustee or serve as a Trustee of the Fund. Each Trustee nominees and each continuing
	Trustees professional experience and additional considerations that contributed to the Boards conclusion that an individual should serve on the Board are summarized in the table below.

	John Honis

	(6/16/1958)



	 


	Trustee


	 



	3 year term (expiring at 2018 annual meeting).


	 


	Trustee since July 2013.



	 


	President of Rand Advisors, LLC since August 2013; Partner of Highland Capital Management, L.P. (HCM) from February 2007 until his resignation in November 2014.


	 


	23


	 


	Manager of Turtle Bay Resort, LLC


	 


	Significant experience in the financial industry; significant managerial and executive experience, including experience as president, chief executive officer or chief restructuring officer of five telecommunication firms; experience
	on other boards of directors/trustees.

	The address for each nominee and Trustee is c/o NexPoint Advisors, L.P., 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201.







	2

	 


	On an annual basis, as a matter of Board policy, the Governance Committee reviews each Trustees performance and determines whether to extend each such Trustees service for another year. The Board has adopted
	a retirement policy wherein the Governance Committee shall not recommend the continued service as a Trustee of a Board member who is older than 80 years of age at the time the Governance Committee reports its findings to the Board.







	3

	 


	The Fund Complex consists of the Fund, each series of HFI, each series of HFII, NexPoint Merger Arbitrage Fund, NexPoint Latin American Opportunities Fund, NexPoint Real Estate Strategies Fund
	(NRESF), NexPoint Opportunistic Credit Fund (NOCF), NexPoint Energy Opportunities Fund, NexPoint Discount Yield Fund, NexPoint Healthcare Opportunities Fund and NexPoint Capital, Inc., a closed-end management investment
	company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act.

	Effective December 4, 2015, Mr. Powell resigned from his position with an affiliate of the Adviser. Although the Fund believes that Mr. Powell is technically no longer an interested person of the Fund, in
	light of his previous employment and the possibility that he may provide consulting services to affiliates of the Adviser, it is possible that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) might in the future determine
	Mr. Powell to be an interested person of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund intends to treat Mr. Powell as an Interested Trustee of the Fund for all purposes other than compensation and the Funds code of ethics (Mr. Powell will be
	compensated at the same rate as the Independent Trustees) from December 16, 2015 until at least December 4, 2017 (the second anniversary of his resignation).







	5

	 


	Since May 1, 2015, Mr. Honis has been treated as an Independent Trustee of the Fund. Prior to that date, Mr. Honis was treated as an Interested Trustee because he was a partner of an investment adviser
	affiliated with the Adviser until his resignation in November 2014. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Honis was entitled to receive aggregate severance and/or deferred compensation payments of approximately $1.5 million from another affiliate
	of the Adviser. Mr. Honis also serves as a director for a portfolio company affiliated with the Adviser. During the Funds last two fiscal years, Mr. Honis aggregate compensation from this portfolio company for his service as a
	director was approximately $50,000.




	In addition, Mr. Honis serves as a trustee of a trust that owns substantially all of
	the economic interest in an investment adviser affiliated with the Adviser. Mr. Honis indirectly receives an asset-based fee in respect of such interest, which is projected to range from $100,000-$150,000 annually. In light of these
	relationships between Mr. Honis and affiliates of the Adviser, it is possible that the SEC might in the future determine Mr. Honis to be an interested person of the Fund.

	Effective December 4, 2015, Mr. Powell resigned from his position with an affiliate of the Adviser. Although the Fund believes that Mr. Powell is technically no longer an interested person of the Fund, in
	light of his previous employment and the possibility that he may provide consulting services to affiliates of the Adviser, it is possible that the SEC might in the future determine Mr. Powell to be an interested person of the Fund. Therefore,
	the Fund intends to treat Mr. Powell as an Interested Trustee of the Fund for all purposes other than compensation and the Funds code of ethics.

	Mr. Dondero controls NexPoint Advisors GP, LLC, which is the general partner of the Adviser. Through his control of NexPoint Advisors GP, LLC, Mr. Dondero may be viewed as having voting and dispositive power
	over the shares of the Common Stock directly owned by the Adviser.




	As of February 28, 2017, the Trustees and officers of the Fund as a
	group owned 20.17% of the Funds outstanding Common Shares, including shares of the Common Stock directly owned by the Advisor over which Mr. Dondero controls through his control of NexPoint Advisors GP, LLC, the general partner of the
	Advisor.


	As of February 28, 2017, none of the Independent Trustees or their immediate family members owned beneficially or of record any securities
	issued by the Adviser, the principal underwriter, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or principal underwriter.



	Role of the Board of Trustees, Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight





	The Role of the Board of Trustees




	The Board
	oversees the management and operations of the Fund. Like most registered investment companies, the day-to-day management and operation of the Fund is performed by various service providers to the Fund, such as the Adviser, and the distributor,
	administrator, custodian, and transfer agent. The Board has appointed senior employees of certain of these service providers as officers of the Fund, with responsibility to monitor and report to the Board on the Funds operations. The Board
	receives regular reports from these officers and service providers regarding the Funds operations. For example, the Treasurer provides reports as to financial reporting matters and investment personnel report on the performance of the Fund.
	The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who administers the Funds compliance program and regularly reports to the Board as to compliance matters. Some of these reports are provided as part of formal in-person Board meetings, which
	are typically held quarterly, in person, and involve the Boards review of, among other items, recent Fund operations. The Board also periodically holds telephonic meetings as part of its review of the Funds activities. From time to time
	one or more members of the Board may also meet with management in less formal settings, between scheduled Board meetings, to discuss various topics. In all cases, however, the role of the Board and of any individual Trustee is one of oversight and
	not of management of the day-to-day affairs of the Fund and its oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of the Funds investments, operations or activities.




	Board Structure and Leadership




	The Board has
	structured itself in a manner that it believes allows it to perform its oversight function effectively. The Board currently consists of five Trustees, four of whom are not interested persons, as defined in the 1940 Act and are
	independent as defined in Rule 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company


	 


	11






	Manual. The remaining Trustee, Mr. Powell, is currently treated as an interested person of the Fund (an Interested Trustee). Mr. Powell is treated as an
	Interested Trustee because of his previous positions with affiliates of the Adviser and the possibility that he may provide consulting services to affiliates of the Adviser. Mr. Powell also serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes
	that it is in the best interests of the Fund for Mr. Powell to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Fund Complex from his former positions with affiliates of the Adviser and his broad experience in the investment industry and with
	the day-to-day management and operation of other investment funds, as described below. The Trustees meet periodically throughout the year in person and by telephone to oversee the Funds activities, review contractual arrangements with service
	providers for the Fund and review the Funds performance. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Board convened ten times. Each Trustee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and
	Committees on which he served during the periods that he served.


	The Board does not have a lead Independent Trustee. As noted below, the Boards
	leadership structure features each of the Independent Trustees serving as a member of one or more Board Committees. Inclusion of Independent Trustees in the Committees allows them to participate in the full range of the Boards oversight
	duties, including oversight of the risk management process. In addition, although the Independent Trustees recognize that having a lead Independent Trustee may in some circumstances help coordinate communications with management and otherwise assist
	a board in the exercise of its oversight duties, the Independent Trustees believe that because of the relatively small size of the Board, the ratio of Independent Trustees to the Interested Trustee and the good working relationship among the Board
	members, it has not been necessary to designate a lead Independent Trustee.


	The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure, including the role
	of the Chairman. The Board also completes an annual self-assessment during which it reviews its leadership and Committee structure and considers whether its structure remains appropriate in light of the Funds current operations. The Board
	believes that its leadership structure, including the current percentage of the Board who are Independent Trustees is appropriate given its specific characteristics. These characteristics include: (i) the extent to which the work of the Board
	is conducted through the standing committees, each of whose meetings are chaired by an Independent Trustee; (ii) the extent to which the Independent Trustees meet as needed, together with their independent legal counsel, in the absence of
	members of management and any member of the Board who is considered an interested person of the Fund; and (iii) Mr. Powells previous positions with affiliates of the Adviser and the possibility that he may provide
	consulting services to affiliates of the Adviser and Mr. Honis previous position with an affiliate of the Adviser, both of which enhance the Boards understanding of the operations of the Adviser.




	Board Oversight of Risk Management.


	 The Boards role is one of oversight, rather than active management. This oversight extends to the
	Funds risk management processes. These processes are embedded in the responsibilities of officers of, and service providers to, the Fund. For example, the Adviser and other service providers to the Fund are primarily responsible for the
	management of the Funds investment risks. The Board has not established a formal risk oversight committee. However, much of the regular work of the Board and its standing Committees addresses aspects of risk oversight. For example, the
	Trustees seek to understand the key risks facing the Fund, including those involving conflicts of interest; how management identifies and monitors these risks on an ongoing basis; how management develops and implements controls to mitigate these
	risks; and how management tests the effectiveness of those controls.


	In the course of providing that oversight, the Board receives a wide range of
	reports on the Funds activities from the Adviser and other service providers, including reports regarding the Funds investment portfolio, the compliance of the Fund with applicable laws, and the Funds financial accounting and
	reporting. The Board also meets periodically with the Funds Chief Compliance Officer to receive reports regarding the compliance of the Fund with the federal securities laws and the Funds internal compliance policies and procedures and
	meets with the Funds Chief Compliance Officer periodically, including at least annually, to review the Chief Compliance Officers annual report, including the Chief Compliance Officers risk-based analysis for the Fund. The
	Boards


	 


	12






	Audit and Qualified Legal Compliance Committee (the Audit Committee) also meets regularly with the Treasurer and the Funds independent registered public accounting firm to
	discuss, among other things, the internal control structure of the Funds financial reporting function. The Board also meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the Fund to receive reports regarding the management of the Fund, including
	its investment risks.


	The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective
	to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Funds goals, that reports received by the Trustees with respect to risk management matters are typically
	summaries of the relevant information, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address risks may be limited in their effectiveness. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, risk management oversight by the Board and by the
	Committees is subject to substantial limitations.



	Committees of the Board



	The Board conducts much of its work through certain standing Committees. The Board has five Committees, the Audit and Qualified Legal Compliance Committee, the
	Governance Committee, the Compliance Committee, the Distribution Oversight Committee and the Alternatives Oversight Committee, which are discussed in greater detail below.




	The Audit and Qualified Legal Compliance Committee



	.

	 The members of the Audit Committee are Dr. Froehlich and Messrs. Hui and
	Ward, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the Funds independent accountants, reviewing with the Funds independent accountants the plans and results of the audit
	engagement and the adequacy of the Funds internal accounting controls and approving professional services provided by the Funds independent accountants. The Audit Committee is charged with compliance with Rules 205.2(k) and 205.3(c) of
	Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding alternative reporting procedures for attorneys representing the Fund who appear and practice before the SEC on behalf of the Fund. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and
	overseeing the valuation of debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by the Board. The Board and Audit Committee will use the
	services of one or more independent valuation firms to help them determine the fair value of these securities. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee meets the current independence and experience requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the
	Exchange Act.


	The Audit Committee met six times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Mr. Ward acts as the Chairman of the Audit
	Committee and as the audit committee financial expert.




	The Governance Committee.


	 The Funds Governance Committees function
	is to oversee and make recommendations to the full Board or the Independent Trustees, as applicable, with respect to the governance of the Fund, selection and nomination of Trustees, compensation of Trustees, and related matters. The Governance
	Committee is also responsible for at least annually evaluating each Trustee and determining whether to recommend each Trustees continued service in that capacity. The Governance Committee will consider recommendations for Trustee nominees from
	shareholders sent to the Secretary of the Trust, 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201. A nomination submission must include all information relating to the recommended nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations or proxy
	statements for the election of Trustees, as well as information sufficient to evaluate the recommended nominees ability to meet the responsibilities of a Trustee of the Fund. Nomination submissions must be accompanied by a written consent of
	the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by the shareholders, and such additional information must be provided regarding the recommended nominee as reasonably requested by the Governance Committee. The
	Governance Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Hui, Ward and Powell. Mr. Powell serves as the Chairman of the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	13








	The Compliance Committee



	.

	 The Compliance Committees function is to oversee and
	assist Board oversight of the Funds compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to seek to address any potential conflicts of interest between the Fund and NexPoint in connection with any potential or existing litigation or other
	legal proceeding relating to securities held by the Fund and the Adviser or another client of the Adviser. The Compliance Committee is currently comprised of Dr. Froehlich and Messrs. Hui and Powell. Mr. Hui acts as the Chairman of the
	Compliance Committee. The Compliance Committee met six times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.




	The Distribution Oversight
	Committee.


	 The members of the Distribution Oversight Committee are Dr. Froehlich and Mr. Honis. The Distribution Oversight Committee is responsible for overseeing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to
	the appointment and oversight of Funds sub-advisers, if any, and any Fund payments to financial intermediaries. Dr. Froehlich serves as Chairman of the Distribution Oversight Committee. The Distribution Oversight Committee met four times
	during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.




	The Alternatives Oversight Committee.


	 The members of the Alternatives Oversight
	Committee are Messrs. Honis and Ward. The Alternatives Oversight Committee is responsible for overseeing any funds that in the Boards determination employ alternative investment strategies. Mr. Honis serves as Chairman of the
	Alternatives Oversight Committee. The Alternatives Oversight Committee met three times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.



	Remuneration of Trustees and Executive Officers



	The
	executive officers of the Fund and those of its Trustees who are interested persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund receive no direct remuneration from the Fund. Each Independent Trustee receives an annual retainer
	of $150,000 payable in quarterly installments and allocated among each portfolio in the Fund Complex based upon relative net assets. The Independent Trustees are reimbursed for actual out-of-pocket expenses relating to attendance at meetings. The
	Independent Trustees do not receive any separate compensation in connection with service on Committees or for attending Board or Committee Meetings. The Trustees do not have any pension or retirement plan.


	The following table summarizes the compensation paid by the Fund to its Trustees and the aggregate compensation paid by the Fund Complex to the Trustees for
	services rendered in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance



	Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require that the Funds Trustees and officers, the
	Adviser, certain persons affiliated with the Adviser, and persons who own beneficially, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the Funds outstanding interests (collectively, Section 16 reporting persons), file initial reports of
	beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of Fund interests with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Section 16 reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish to the Fund copies of all
	Section 16(a) forms they file with respect to shares of the Fund. As of the date of the Proxy Statement, the Fund is aware that one late Form 3 for the Fund was filed on July 19,


	 


	15






	2016 for Dr. Bob Froehlich, Independent Trustee of the Fund. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports of ownership furnished to the Fund, the Fund believes that during the past
	fiscal year all other officers, trustees and greater than 10% beneficial holders of the Fund complied with all applicable filing requirements.






	PROPOSAL 2




	APPROVAL OF
	A CHANGE TO THE FUNDS FUNDAMENTAL POLICY REGARDING CONCENTRATION



	The Funds Board has approved and recommends that
	shareholders of the Fund approve a proposal to change the Funds fundamental policy regarding concentration. Currently, the Funds fundamental investment policy regarding concentration provides that the Fund may not invest 25% or more of
	the value of its total assets in any single industry or group of industries (the Current Policy). The Current Policy may not be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common shares and preferred
	shares, if any, voting together as a single class, and of the holders of a majority of the outstanding preferred shares, if any, voting as a separate class.


	The Board approved a change in the fundamental policy regarding concentration for the Fund based upon the recommendation of the Funds Adviser that the
	Fund would be better able to pursue its investment objectives to provide both current income and capital appreciation if it were to concentrate its investments in the real estate industry. The Adviser noted that due to the Funds current
	fundamental investment policy, the Funds is currently precluded from investing additional assets in the real estate industry and therefore cannot take advantage of certain investment opportunities the Adviser believes would be beneficial to
	the Fund.


	The Board considered NexPoints expertise and the breadth of opportunities available in the real estate industry, noting that in the three
	years ended December 31, 2016, NexPoint and its affiliates (Highland) have completed approximately $2.3 billion of commercial real estate transactions. The Board also considered that Highland manages various investment vehicles that
	primarily invest in real estate related assets, including two wholly-owned real estate investment trust (REIT) subsidiaries of the Fund, a real estate focused closed-end interval fund overseen by the Board (NRESF), a non-traded
	multifamily REIT, and a publically traded multifamily REIT. The Board further noted that, although past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Funds investments in the real estate industry have performed well during the past five
	years, with preferred equity real estate positions in one of the Funds REIT subsidiaries contributing meaningfully to the Funds performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Board considered that the proposed change to the
	Funds fundamental policy would better position the Fund to take advantage of Highlands experience in the real estate sector and could provide additional opportunities for the Fund to fulfill its investment objectives, though there is no
	guarantee that any of the Funds investments in the real estate industry or otherwise will be successful or that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.


	The Board also considered the risks inherent in the proposed change, including that increasing the percentage of the Funds total assets that can be
	invested in the securities of issuers in the real estate industry increases the risk that the Fund will be adversely affected by events impacting the real estate industry. Additionally, a concentrated fund would be more significantly affected by
	events impacting the real estate industry than would a fund that was not so concentrated. Financial, economic, business, and other developments affecting issuers in the real estate industry will have a greater effect on the Fund, and if securities
	of the real estate industry fall out of favor, the Fund could underperform, or its net asset value may be more volatile than, funds that have greater industry diversification. Issuers principally engaged in the real estate industry, including REITs,
	may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of real estate properties; (iii) risks related to local
	economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition; (iv) increases in property taxes and operating expenses; (v) changes in zoning laws; (vi) casualty and condemnation losses; (vii) variations in rental income,


	 


	16






	neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants; (viii) the availability of financing and (ix) changes in interest rates and leverage.


	For these reasons, the Board recommends that shareholders of the Fund approve the following as a new fundamental investment policy for the Fund (the New
	Policy), replacing the Current Policy described above:


	The Fund will, under normal market conditions, invest at least 25% of the
	value of its total assets at the time of purchase in the securities of issuers conducting their principal business activities in the real estate industry, including obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, any state or territory of
	the United States or any of their agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions, and investments by any territory of the United States or any of their agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions for which the underlying collateral
	is real estate.


	If shareholders approve the New Policy for the Fund, the New Policy will take effect shortly after the Annual Meeting. If shareholders do
	not approve the New Policy, the Fund will continue to operate with its current fundamental investment policy regarding concentration.



	Vote Required
	for Approval of Change to the Funds Fundamental Policy Regarding Concentration



	Approval of the New Policy requires the affirmative vote of the
	holders of a majority of the Common Shares of the Fund, represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote for the approval of the New Policy. Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held in street
	name by brokers that indicate on their proxies that they do not have discretionary authority to vote such shares as to the approval of the New Policy) are counted as present at the Annual Meeting but, assuming the presence of a Quorum, will
	have the effect of a vote against the New Policy.



	THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE
	FOR THE APPROVAL OF A CHANGE TO THE FUNDS FUNDAMENTAL POLICY REGARDING CONCENTRATION.




	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	At a meeting held on December 15-16, 2016, the Funds Audit Committee approved, and the Funds Board, including
	a majority of the Independent Trustees, ratified the selection of, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the Funds independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Representatives of
	PwC will not be present at the Annual Meeting. After reviewing the Funds audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Funds Audit Committee recommended to the Funds Board that such statements
	be included in the Funds Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. A copy of the Audit Committees report appears below.



	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees and Services



	The following chart reflects fees paid to PwC in the Funds last two fiscal years. One hundred percent (100%) of all services provided by PwC to the
	Fund in each year were pre-approved and no fees were subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(c) of Regulation S-X. The audit services are approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to an audit engagement letter,
	and, in accordance with the Funds pre-approval policies and procedures, the Audit Committee of the Fund must pre-approve all non-audit services provided by PwC, and all non-audit services provided by PwC to the Adviser, or any entity
	controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund that are related to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. In some circumstances, when certain services were not recognized
	at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services, the pre-approval requirement may be


	 


	17






	waived if the aggregate amount of the fees for such non-audit services constitutes less than five percent of the total amount of revenues paid to PwC by the Fund during the fiscal year in which
	the non-audit services are provided. PwC provided non-audit services to the Adviser during the Funds last two fiscal years, but these services did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund, and therefore were
	not subject to pre-approval pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. PwC did not provide any non-audit services to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund.
	The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Adviser is compatible with maintaining PwCs independence.

	Report of the Audit Committee



	The Audit Committee oversees the Funds accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the Funds financial statements. Management is
	responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Funds financial statements, the Funds accounting and financial and reporting principles, and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with
	accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report dated December 31, 2016 with management and discussed the quality of the accounting principles, the
	reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.


	The Audit Committee has considered and discussed the
	above described December 31, 2016 audited financial statements with management and with PwC. The Audit Committee has also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, as amended
	(AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in Rule 3200T,

	The Auditors Communication With Those Charged With Governance

	. The Audit Committee


	 


	18






	reviewed with PwC, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgment as to the
	quality, not just the acceptability, of the Funds accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. Finally, the Audit Committee reviewed the
	written disclosures and the letters from PwC required by PCAOB Rule 3526,

	Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence

	, as currently in effect, has considered whether the provision of other non-audit services by PwC to the Fund
	are compatible with maintaining PwCs independence, and has discussed with PwC its independence of the Fund.


	The Audit Committee discussed with PwC
	the overall scope and plans for the audit. The Audit Committee met with PwC to discuss the results of their audit, their evaluations of the Funds internal controls and the overall quality of the Funds financial reporting.


	Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee
	referred to in this proxy statement and in the Audit Committees Charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the Funds audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report to
	Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and filed with the SEC.


	Shareholders are reminded, however, that the members of the Audit
	Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting. Members of the Audit Committee rely, without independent verification, on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and PwC.
	Accordingly, the Audit Committees oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to
	assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committees considerations and discussions, referred to above, do not assure that the audit of the Funds financial statements has been
	carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, that the financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or that the Funds independent registered public
	accounting firm is, in fact, independent.

	OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE ANNUAL MEETING



	The Trustees do not intend to present any other business at the Annual Meeting nor are they aware that any shareholder intends to do so. If, however, any
	other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their judgment.



	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION







	Shareholder
	Proposals



	Any proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the Funds 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received at the
	Funds principal executive office no later than December 28, 2017 for inclusion in the Funds proxy statement and proxy card relating to the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under
	the 1934 Act and all other legal requirements. Such proposals must also comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC if such proposals are to be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy. The submission by a
	shareholder of a proposal for inclusion


	 


	19






	in the proxy materials does not guarantee that it will be included. Any proposals submitted after such date will not be included in the Funds proxy statement and proxy card relating to the
	2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Proxies solicited by the Fund will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to these proposals if the proposals are not received by the Fund, in good order and complying with all applicable legal
	requirements, by March 13, 2018, and may confer discretionary voting authority with respect to proposals received before such date, in each case subject to SEC rules governing the exercise of this authority.



	Delivery Requirements



	The SEC has adopted rules that
	permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability of
	Proxy Materials (Notice) addressed to those shareholders or by sending separate Notices for each household account in a single envelope. This process, which is commonly referred to as householding, potentially provides extra
	convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Fund and some brokers household proxy materials or Notices, delivering a single proxy statement or Notice to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have
	been received from the affected shareholders. Once a shareholder has received notice from a broker or the Fund that they will be householding materials to the shareholders address, householding will continue until the shareholder is notified
	otherwise or until the shareholder revokes consent.


	We will deliver promptly, upon request, a separate copy of any of these documents to shareholders at
	a shared address to which a single copy of such document(s) was delivered. Shareholders who wish to receive a separate copy of any of these documents, or to receive a single copy of such documents if multiple copies were delivered, now or in the
	future, should submit their request by writing to the Fund c/o NexPoint Advisors, L.P., 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201 or calling the Fund at 1-866-351-4440.



	Communications with Trustees



	Shareholders of the Fund
	who wish to communicate with Trustees (or to the Independent Trustees as a group) should send communications to the attention of the Secretary of the Fund, c/o NexPoint Advisors, L.P., 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201, and all
	communications will be directed to the Trustee or Trustees indicated in the communication or, if no Trustee or Trustees are indicated, to all Trustees.






	COPIES OF THE FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT DATED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT DATED JUNE 30, 2016 TO SHAREHOLDERS ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST,
	WITHOUT CHARGE, BY WRITING THE FUND AT 6201 15TH AVENUE, BROOKLYN, NEW YORK 11219, OR BY CALLING TOLL-FREE 1-866-351-4440.



	It is important that
	proxies be returned promptly. Therefore, whether or not you expect to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you are urged to fill in, sign and return the proxy in the enclosed stamped, self-addressed envelope.

	GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICANTS






	 




	 



	A.





	The Investment Companies






	 




	 



	1.





	NexPoint Capital






	NexPoint Capital is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be
	regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. NexPoint Capital was formed as a Delaware limited liability company, NexPoint Capital, LLC, in September 2013 and converted into a Delaware corporation on June 10, 2014. In
	connection with the conversion, NexPoint Advisors, the existing member of NexPoint Capital, LLC, became a stockholder of NexPoint Capital. NexPoint Capital elected in August 2014 to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act

	4

	and commenced operations on September 2, 2014. NexPoint Capitals principal place of business is 300 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201.


	NexPoint Capital has filed a registration statement on Form 8-A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
	


	1934 Act


	), a registration statement on Form N-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 


	1933 Act


	), and a notification of election to be subject to Sections 55 through 65 of the 1940 Act
	on Form N-54A. As a business development company, NexPoint Capital is subject to the periodic reporting requirements under Section 13(a) of the 1934 Act.


	NexPoint Advisors serves as NexPoint Capitals investment adviser. NexPoint Capitals investment objective is to
	generate current income and capital appreciation primarily through investments in middle-market healthcare companies, middle-market companies in non-healthcare sectors, syndicated floating rate debt of large nonpublic and public companies and
	collateralized loan obligations. NexPoint Capital defines middle-market companies as companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $2.5 billion and syndicated floating rate debt refers to loans and other instruments
	originated by a bank to a corporation that are sold off, or syndicated, to investors in pieces. NexPoint Capital expects that its portfolio will be concentrated primarily in senior floating rate debt securities.


	NexPoint Capital maintains a six-member board of directors, of which four members are not 


	interested
	persons


	 of NexPoint Capital within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the 


	Independent Directors


	). No Independent Director will have any direct or indirect financial interest in any
	Co-Investment Transaction

	5

	or any interest in any portfolio company, other than through an interest (if any) in the securities of the Applicants.


	 


	 


	 



	4

	Section 2(a)(48) of the 1940 Act defines a business development company as any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities described in
	Sections 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the 1940 Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.



	5

	


	Co-Investment Transaction


	 means any transaction in which an
	Investment Company (or one of its Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiaries) participates together with one or more other Investment Companies and/or Private Funds in reliance on the requested Order. 


	Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction


	 means any investment opportunity in which an Investment Company (or a Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary) could not participate together with one or more other Investment Companies and/or Private Funds without obtaining and
	relying on the Order.

	NHF






	NHF is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. NHF was organized as a statutory
	trust under the laws of the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated as of March 10, 2006 and commenced operations on June 29, 2006, following its initial public offering. NHFs principal place of
	business is 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201.


	NHF has filed a registration statement on Form 8-A under
	the 1934 Act, a registration statement on Form N-2 under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and a notification of registration on Form N-8A under the 1940 Act.


	NexPoint Advisors serves as NHFs investment adviser. NHFs investment objective is to generate current income and
	capital appreciation primarily through investments in: (i) secured and unsecured floating and fixed rate loans; (ii) bonds and other debt obligations; (iii) debt obligations of stressed, distressed and bankrupt issuers;
	(iv) structured products, including but not limited to, mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations; and (v) equities.


	NHF maintains a six-member board of trustees, of which four members are not interested persons of NHF within the
	meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the 


	Independent Trustees


	). NHFs board of trustees is currently comprised of the same individuals as comprise NexPoint Capitals board of directors. No Independent
	Trustee of NHF will have any direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction or any interest in any portfolio company, other than through an interest (if any) in the securities of the Applicants.

	HCOA & HNR






	HCOA is a series of Highland Funds II, an unincorporated business trust organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
	Massachusetts pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated as of August 10, 1992. HCOA commenced operation on September 8, 1993. HNR is a series of Highland Funds I, a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware pursuant
	to an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated as of February 28, 2006. HNR commenced operations on May 18, 2005. The principal place of business of each of HCOA and HNR is 200 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75201.


	Each of HCOA and HNR has filed a registration statement on Form N-1A under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and a notification of
	registration on Form N-8A under the 1940 Act.


	Highland Advisors serves as the investment adviser to each of HCOA and HNR.
	HCOAs investment object is to achieve long-term growth of capital and future income by investing in a portfolio of U.S. and foreign equity, debt and money market securities. Under normal market conditions, HCOA intends to invest at least 50%
	of its net assets in equity securities and at least 40% of its net assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers.


	HNRs
	investment objective is to seek to achieve high total returns while attempting to minimize losses by investing at least 80% of the value of its total assets (net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in credit instruments. Credit
	instruments include secured and unsecured floating and fixed rate loans; bonds and other debt obligations; debt obligations of stressed, distressed


	 


	3






	and bankrupt issuers; structured products, including but not limited to, mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, convertible bonds or preferred
	stock, and master limited partnerships. Prior to July 1, 2014, HNR was operated as a privately-offered, closed-end fund managed by Highland Advisors with the same investment objective and similar investment strategies.


	HCOA and HNR each maintains a six-member board of trustees, of which four members are Independent Trustees. The board of
	trustees of each of HCOA and HNR is currently comprised of the same individuals as comprise the board of directors of NexPoint Capital and the board of trustees of NHF. No Independent Trustee of HCOA or HNR will have any direct or indirect financial
	interest in any Co-Investment Transaction or any interest in any portfolio company, other than through an interest (if any) in the securities of the Applicants.


	 




	 



	4.





	Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiaries






	Each of the Investment Companies may, from time to time, form one or more special purpose, wholly owned subsidiaries (each, a
	


	Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary


	) (a) whose sole business purpose is to hold one or more investments and issue debt on behalf of such Investment Company, to obtain debt financing for those investments and, in the
	case of a Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary organized as a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (


	SBA Act


	), to maintain a license under the SBA Act and issue debentures
	guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; (b) that is wholly owned by such Investment Company (with the applicable Investment Company at all times holding directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, 100% of the voting and
	economic interests); (c) with respect to which the board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of such Investment Company has the sole authority to make all determinations with respect to the Wholly Owned Investment
	Subsidiarys participation under the conditions to this Application; and (d) that is an entity that would be an investment company but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Any Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary would be
	prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any other Investment Company or Private Fund because the Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary would be a company controlled by the applicable Investment Company for purposes of
	Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder.


	The Applicants request that any
	Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of the Investment Company of which it is a subsidiary and that the participation in any such transaction by any Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary
	be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the Investment Company of which it is a subsidiary were participating directly. The Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because any Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary would have no
	purpose other than serving as a holding and financing vehicle for the applicable Investment Companys investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between an Investment Company and its Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary. The
	board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of an Investment Company would make all relevant determinations under the conditions of this Application with regard to the participation of such Investment Companys Wholly Owned
	Investment Subsidiary in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the board of directors or the board of trustees, as applicable, of an Investment Company would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of any Wholly Owned Investment
	Subsidiary in such Investment Companys place. If an Investment Company proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with its Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary, the board of


	 


	4






	directors or the board of trustees, as applicable, of such Investment Company will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Investment Company and the
	Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary.

	focus, with a target allocation of 40% to 60% of the net asset value of HMSCF. HMSCF may invest in (i) debt and debt-like securities (including, debt securities of varying maturities, debt securities paying a fixed or fluctuating rate of
	interest, inflation-indexed bonds, structured notes, loan assignments, loan participations, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligation (


	CLO


	) securities (including, rated and unrated, debt, equity and preference
	share instruments relating to collateralized loan obligations), debt securities convertible into equity securities, and securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities, by foreign governments or
	international agencies or supranational entities or by domestic or private issuers), and (ii) equity and equity-like securities (including, common stock, preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock, rights and warrants or
	securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock, equity or subordinated tranches of asset-backed securities, including CLOs, and life settlement policies and other instruments that have equity-like

	2.





	HCHP






	HCHP registered as an exempted limited partnership pursuant to the Exempted Limited Partnership Law of the Cayman Islands on
	February 1, 2011 and commenced operations in February 2011. Highland Capital Healthcare Partners GP, LLC serves as general partner of HCHP. The general partners principal place of business is 300 Crescent Court, Suite 700, Dallas, Texas
	75201.


	HCHP is a Private Fund which relies on Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act.


	Limited partner interests in HCHP have not been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act, or the securities laws of any of
	the states of the United States. The offering and any potential sale of limited partner interests will be made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act for offers and sales of securities which do not involve
	any public offering and analogous exemptions under state securities laws. HCHPs partnership interests are currently held exclusively by two feeder funds as limited partners, as well as Highland Capital Healthcare Partners GP, LLC,
	as the general partner.


	HCHPs investment objective is to seek consistent risk adjusted returns on capital primarily
	through buying long and selling short public equity securities in the healthcare sector.


	The IC Advisers expect that
	certain portfolio companies that are appropriate investments for a Private Fund may also be appropriate for one or more Investment Companies, with certain exceptions


	 


	5






	based on available capital or diversification. An Investment Company, however, will not be obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to it.

	A.





	Co-Investment in Portfolio Companies by the Investment Companies and the Private Funds






	 




	 



	1.








	Mechanics of the Co-Investment Program







	As described above, the IC Advisers and the Current Advisers to Private Funds manage the Investment Companies and the Existing
	Private Funds pursuant to their respective investment advisory agreements. Each of the IC Advisers anticipates that it will determine that certain investments it recommends to an Investment Company would also be appropriate investments for one or
	more other Investment Companies or Private Funds. Likewise, each of the Current Advisers to Private Funds anticipates that it will determine that certain investments it recommends to the Existing Private Funds would also be appropriate investments
	for one or more Investment Companies. Such a determination may result in an Investment Company co-investing in certain investments with one or more other Investment Companies or Private Funds.


	Upon issuance of the requested Order, the IC Advisers and the Current Advisers to Private Funds will refer to the applicable IC
	Adviser all Potential Co-Investment Transactions within an Investment Companys then-current investment objectives and strategies (as described in its registration statement on Form N-1A or Form N-2, as applicable, and other filings made with
	the Commission by such Investment Company under the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act, any reports filed by such Investment Company with the Commission under the 1934 Act or the 1940 Act and such


	 


	7






	Investment Companys reports to stockholders, the 


	Objectives and Strategies


	) that are considered for another Investment Company or a Private Fund, and such
	investment opportunities may result in a Co-Investment Transaction. For each such referral, the applicable IC Adviser will consider the investment objective, investment policies, investment position, investment strategies, investment restrictions,
	regulatory and tax requirements, capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to such Investment Company. Likewise, when selecting investments for a Private Fund, the applicable Current Adviser to the Private Fund will
	select investments separately for the Private Fund, considering the investment objective, investment policies, investment position, investment strategies, investment restrictions, regulatory and tax requirements, capital available for investment and
	other pertinent factors applicable to such Private Fund.


	Each Co-Investment Transaction would be allocated between the
	Investment Companies and the Private Funds participating in the Co-Investment Transaction pursuant to written allocation policies and procedures adopted by the Advisers. Each Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation of such
	Co-Investment Transaction would be approved prior to the actual investment by the required majority (within the meaning of Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) (the 


	Required Majority


	) of the Investment Companys board
	of directors or board of trustees, as applicable. If the aggregate amount recommended for investment by all Investment Companies and Private Funds participating in a Co-Investment Transaction exceeds the amount of the actual investment opportunity,
	then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each partys capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated of the parties involved in the investment opportunity, up to the amount proposed to
	be invested by each party.


	An Investment Companys capital available for investment will be determined based on the
	amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by such Investment Companys board of directors or board of
	trustees, as applicable, or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. Likewise, a Private Funds capital available for investment is determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, if
	any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the Private Funds Adviser or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.


	Any party that desires to make a 


	follow-on investment


	 (

	i.e.

	, an additional investment in an
	existing portfolio company, including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges or other rights to acquire securities of the portfolio company) in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired by an Investment Company in a
	Co-Investment Transaction, or that desires to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an investment acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, will adhere to the conditions contained in this Application. The Co-Investment Program requires that the
	terms, conditions, price, class of securities, settlement date and registration rights applicable to any party be the same as those applicable to any Investment Companys investment.


	With respect to pro rata dispositions and follow-on investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, the Investment Companies may
	participate in a pro rata disposition or follow-on investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) the proposed participation of such Investment Company and each other Investment Company or
	Private Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or follow-on investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the board of directors or board of trustees, as
	applicable, of the Investment Company has approved such Investment Companys participation in pro rata dispositions and follow-on investments as being in the best interests of the Investment Company. If such board does not so approve, any such
	disposition or follow-on investment will be submitted to


	 


	8






	the directors of the Investment Company who are eligible to vote under Section 57 of the 1940 Act (the


	Eligible Directors


	). The board of directors or board of
	trustees, as applicable, of an Investment Company may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and follow-on investments, with the result that all dispositions and/or follow-on investments must be submitted to
	the Eligible Directors of such Investment Company.


	 




	 



	2.






	Reasons for Co-Investing







	It is expected that co-investment in portfolio companies by the Investment Companies and the Private Funds will increase
	favorable investment opportunities for each participant. The Co-Investment Program will be effected for an Investment Company only if it is approved by the Required Majority of such Investment Companys board of directors or board of trustees,
	as applicable, on the basis that it would be advantageous for the Investment Company to have the additional capital from other Investment Companies or from the Private Funds available to meet the funding requirements of attractive investments in
	portfolio companies. Registered investment companies and business development companies that make investments of the type contemplated by the Investment Companies typically limit their participation in any one transaction to a specific dollar
	amount, which may be determined by legal or internally imposed prudential limits on exposure in a single investment. In view of the foregoing, in cases where an IC Adviser identifies investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments, it
	must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles. The availability of the other Investment Companies and the Private Funds as investing partners of such Investment Company may alleviate some of that necessity in certain
	circumstances.


	An Investment Company could lose some investment opportunities if it is unable to provide
	one-stop financing to a potential portfolio company. Portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an IC Adviser due to the applicable Investment Companys inability to commit the full amount of financing required
	by the portfolio company in a timely manner (

	i.e.

	, without the delay that typically would be associated with obtaining single-transaction exemptive relief from the Commission). By reducing the number of occasions on which an Investment
	Companys individual or aggregate investment limits require an IC Adviser to arrange a syndication with unaffiliated entities, such Investment Company will likely be required to forego fewer suitable investment opportunities. With the assets of
	other Investment Companies and the Private Funds available for co-investment, there should be an increase in the number of opportunities accessible to each Investment Company.


	The IC Advisers and the board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of each Investment Company believe that it
	would be advantageous for such Investment Companies to co-invest with the other Investment Companies and the Private Funds and that such investments would be consistent with the investment objective, investment policies, investment position,
	investment strategies, investment restrictions, regulatory and tax requirements, capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to such Investment Company.


	The IC Advisers also believe that co-investment by the Investment Companies with the other Investment Companies and the Private
	Funds will afford each Investment Company the ability to achieve greater diversification and, together with the Private Funds, the opportunity to exercise greater influence on the portfolio companies in which the Investment Companies and the Private
	Funds co-invest.

	Applicable Law






	 




	 



	1.






	Sections 17(d), 57(a)(4) and 57(i) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder







	Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act make it unlawful for any person who is related to a registered
	investment company or a business development company, respectively, in a


	 


	9






	manner described in Section 2(a)(3) or Section 57(b), respectively, of the 1940 Act, acting as principal, knowingly to effect any transaction in which the registered investment company
	or business development company or a company controlled by such registered investment company or business development company is a joint or a joint and several participant with that person in contravention of rules and regulations as the Commission
	may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the registered investment company or business development company or controlled company on a basis less advantageous than that of the other participant.


	Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act prohibits any person who is related to a registered investment company or business development
	company in a manner described in Section 2(a)(3) or Section 57(b), respectively, of the 1940 Act, acting as principal in, from participating in, or effecting any transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint
	arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the registered investment company or business development company or a company controlled by such registered investment company or business development company is a participant, unless an application
	regarding the joint enterprise, arrangement or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the submission of the plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval, or prior
	to its adoption or modification if not so submitted. In passing upon applications under Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act, the Commission considers whether the participation by the registered investment company or business development company or
	controlled company in such joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
	Although the Commission has not adopted any rules specifically under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act provides that the rules under Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act applicable to registered closed-end
	investment companies (

	e.g.

	, Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act) are, in the interim, deemed to apply to transactions subject to Section 57(a) of the 1940 Act.


	 




	 



	2.






	Section 2(a)(3) and Section 57(b) of the 1940 Act







	Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act specifies the persons to whom the prohibitions of Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act
	apply, including: (1) any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling or holding with power to vote five percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of a registered investment company; (2) any person five percent or more of
	whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled or held with power to vote by a registered investment company; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with

	6

	such registered investment company; (4) any officer, director, partner, copartner or employee of a registered investment company; and (5) any investment adviser, or any member of an
	advisory board, of a registered investment company.


	Section 57(b) of the 1940 Act specifies the persons to whom the
	prohibitions of Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act apply, including: (1) any director, officer, employee or member of an advisory board of a business development company or any person (other than the business development company itself) who
	is, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act, an


	 



	6

	Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act defines control as the power to
	exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company. The definition of control clarifies that any person who owns beneficially,
	either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed to control such company; any person who does not so own more than 25% of the voting securities of a company shall be
	presumed not to control such company; and a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person.

	affiliated person

	7

	of any such person; or (2) any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or
	person directly or indirectly either controlling, controlled by or under common control with a business development company (except the business development company itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the
	business development company, would not be directly or indirectly under the control of a person who controls the business development company), or any person who is, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act an affiliated person
	of such person.


	 




	 



	C.





	Need for Relief






	Transactions effected as part of the Co-Investment Program for each Investment Company could be prohibited by
	Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder without a prior exemptive order of the Commission to the extent that the other Investment Companies or Private Funds, as applicable, fall within the category of
	persons described by Section 2(a)(3) or Section 57(b), as applicable, of the 1940 Act. The respective IC Adviser of each Investment Company and any other Investment Company or Private Fund that it advises could be deemed to be persons
	related to such Investment Company in a manner described by Section 2(a)(3) or Section 57(b), as applicable, and therefore prohibited by Section 17(d) or Section 57(a)(4), as applicable, and Rule 17d-1 from participating in the
	Co-Investment Program. In addition, because the other Advisers are affiliated persons of each IC Adviser, such Advisers, the Investment Companies and Private Funds advised by any of them could be deemed to be persons related to such
	Investment Company in a manner described by Section 2(a)(3) or Section 57(b), as applicable, and also prohibited from participating in the Co-Investment Program. Finally, because any Wholly Owned Investment Subsidiary will be controlled by
	an Investment Company, it will subject to Section 17(d) or Section 57(a)(4), and thus also subject to the provisions of Rule 17d-1.


	 




	 



	D.





	Requested Relief






	Accordingly, the Applicants respectfully request an Order of the Commission, pursuant to Section 17(d) and
	Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, permitting the Investment Companies and the Private Funds to participate in the Co-Investment Program.


	 



	7

	Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an affiliated person of another person as any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such
	other person.

	E.





	Precedents






	The Commission has granted co-investment relief in the past.

	8

	Although
	various precedents involve somewhat different allocation formulae, approval procedures and presumptions for co-investment transactions to protect the interests of public investors in the registered investment companies and business development
	company applicants than those described in this Application, the Applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited
	orders. We note, in particular, that the co-investment protocol to be followed by the Applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by Garrison Capital, Inc. and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on January 12,
	2015, Fifth Street Finance Corp. and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on September 9, 2014, Solar Capital Ltd. and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on July 28, 2014, WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. and its affiliates,
	for which an order was granted on July 8, 2014, PennantPark Investment Corporation and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on April 15, 2014, Medley Capital Corporation and its affiliates, for which order was granted on
	November 25, 2013, and Stellus Capital Investment Corporation and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on October 23, 2013.

	The Applicants Legal Arguments






	Rule 17d-1 was promulgated by the Commission pursuant to Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and made applicable to business
	development companies by Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act.

	Rule 17d-1(a)

	under the 1940 Act permits an otherwise prohibited person, acting as principal, to participate in, or effect a transaction in
	connection with, a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing

	plan in which a registered investment company or business development company or a company controlled by such registered investment company or business development company is a participant if an
	application regarding the joint enterprise, arrangement or profit-sharing plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted by an order issued prior to the submission of such plan or any modification thereof to security holders for
	approval, or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted. Rule 17d-1(b) under the 1940 Act states that in passing upon applications under such rule, the Commission shall consider whether the participation by the investment company or
	controlled company in such joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different
	from or less advantageous than that of other participants.


	The Applicants submit that the fact that the Required Majority
	will approve each Co-Investment Transaction before investment, in addition to the other protective conditions set forth in this Application, will ensure that each Investment Company will be treated fairly. The conditions to which the requested
	relief will be subject are designed to ensure that the principals of the Advisers would not be able to favor one Investment Company or a Private Fund over the other Investment Companies through the allocation of investment opportunities between
	them. Because many attractive investment opportunities for an Investment Company will also be attractive investment opportunities for the other Investment Companies and the Private Funds, the Applicants submit that the Co-Investment Program presents
	an attractive alternative to instituting an equitable protocol for the allocation of 100% of individual investment opportunities to either a single Investment Company or to the Private Funds as opportunities arise. The Applicants submit that each
	Investment Companys participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and on a basis that is not different from, or less advantageous than, that of the other
	Investment Companies or the Private Funds.


	Other than pro rata dispositions and follow-on investments as provided in
	conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the IC Advisers will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the Eligible Directors of the applicable Investment
	Company, and the Required Majority will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by such Investment Company.


	Applicants believe that participation by the Investment Companies in pro rata dispositions and follow-on investments, as
	provided in conditions 7 and 8, is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata
	dispositions and follow-on investments, eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness. The Applicants note that the Commission has adopted a
	similar pro rata approach in the context of Rule 23c-2, which relates to the redemption by a closed-end investment company of less than all of a class of its securities, indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach
	provides.

	G.





	Conditions






	The Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:


	1.             Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction
	for a Private Fund or another Investment Company that falls within an Investment Companys then-current Objectives and


	 



	10


	See e.g.

	the discussion in

	Gladstone Capital Corp., et al.

	application in
	SEC File No. 812-13878 filed on June 29, 2012.


	 


	13






	Strategies, the applicable IC Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of such investment for such Investment Company in light of such Investment Companys
	then-current circumstances.


	2.          (a)         If the applicable IC Adviser
	deems an Investment Companys participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for such Investment Company, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for such Investment Company;


	(b)         If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable IC Adviser to be
	invested in such Potential Co-Investment Transaction by an Investment Company, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Investment Companies and Private Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the
	amount of the investment opportunity, then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participating partys capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be
	invested by each party. The applicable IC Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Investment Company with information concerning each participating partys available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their
	review of such Investment Companys investments for compliance with these allocation procedures; and


	(c)         After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
	applicable IC Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the amount proposed to be invested by each Investment Company and each Private Fund, to the Eligible Directors of each
	participating Investment Company for their consideration. An Investment Company will co-invest with one or more other Investment Companies and/or Private Funds only if, prior to the Investment Companys participation in the Potential
	Co-Investment Transaction, the Required Majority concludes that:


	(i)         the
	terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to such Investment Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of such Investment Company or its
	stockholders on the part of any person concerned;


	(ii)         the Potential
	Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:


	(A) the interests of the stockholders of such Investment
	Company; and


	(B) such Investment Companys then-current Objectives and Strategies;


	(iii)         the investment by another Investment Company or any Private Fund would
	not disadvantage such Investment Company, and participation by such Investment Company would not be on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of any other participant; provided, that if any other participant, but not such Investment
	Company itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company,
	such event will not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if


	(A)         the Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the
	selection of such director or board observer, if any;

	(B)         the Advisers
	agree to provide periodic reports to each Investment Companys board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the
	exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and


	(C)         any fees or other compensation that any other Investment
	Company, Private Fund or any affiliated person of another Investment Company or Private Fund receives in connection with the right of such other Investment Company or Private Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to
	participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Investment Companies and the participating Private Funds (which each may, in turn, share their portion with their affiliated
	persons) in accordance with the amount of each partys investment; and


	(iv)         the proposed investment by the Investment Company will not benefit the
	other Investment Companies, the Advisers, the Private Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13; (B) to the extent permitted
	by Sections 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable; (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction; or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation
	described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).


	3.             Each Investment Company
	has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.


	4.
	            The applicable IC Adviser will present to the board of directors or the board of trustees, as applicable, of each Investment Company for whom it serves as investment adviser, on
	a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Investment Companies and the Private Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within such Investment Companys then-current
	Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to such Investment Company and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to such Investment Company. All information presented to a board pursuant to this condition
	will be kept for the life of such Investment Company and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.


	5.             Except for follow-on investments made in accordance with condition
	8, an Investment Company will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which any other Investment Company, Private Fund or any affiliated person of another Investment Company or Private Fund is an existing investor.


	6.             An Investment Company will not participate in any Potential
	Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date and registration rights will be the same for each participating Investment Company and Private Fund. The grant to another
	participant, but not such Investment Company, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the
	governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.


	 


	15






	7.
	        (a)        If any Investment Company or Private Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a
	Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable IC Adviser for each Investment Company that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction will:


	(i)         notify such Investment Company of the proposed disposition
	at the earliest practical time; and


	(ii)         formulate a
	recommendation as to participation by such Investment Company in any such disposition.


	(b)
	        Each Investment Company will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to any other
	participants.


	(c)         An Investment Company may participate in such
	disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of such Investment Company and of each other participant in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investment in the issuer
	immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of such Investment Company has approved as being in the best interests of such Investment Company the ability to participate in such
	dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application); and (iii) such board is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the
	applicable IC Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to an Investment Companys participation to the Eligible Directors of such Investment Company, and the Investment Company will participate in such disposition solely to the extent
	that the Required Majority determines that it is in the Investment Companys best interests.


	(d)
	        Each Investment Company and each other participant will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.


	8.         (a)        If any other participant desires to make
	a follow-on investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, each IC Adviser to any Investment Company that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction will:


	(i)         notify such Investment Company of the proposed transaction at the earliest
	practical time; and


	(ii)         formulate a recommendation as to the proposed
	participation, including the amount of the proposed follow-on investment, by such Investment Company.


	(b)
	        Such Investment Company may participate in such follow-on investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of such Investment Company and
	each other participant in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investment in the issuer immediately preceding the follow-on investment; (ii) the board of directors or board of trustees, as applicable, of such Investment Company
	has approved as being in the best interests of such Investment Company the ability to participate in follow-on investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application); and (iii) such board is provided on a quarterly
	basis with a list of all follow on investments made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the applicable IC Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to such Investment Companys participation to the Eligible
	Directors, and such Investment Company will participate in such follow-on investment solely to the extent that the Required Majority determines that it is in such Investment Companys best interests.


	 


	16






	(c)         If with respect to any
	follow-on investment:


	(i)         the amount of the opportunity is not based on
	the Investment Companies and the Private Funds outstanding investments immediately preceding the follow-on investment; and


	(ii)         the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable IC Adviser to be
	invested by each Investment Company in the follow-on investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participants in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity, then the amount to be invested by each such
	party will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participating partys capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each.


	(d)         The acquisition of follow-on investments as permitted by this condition
	will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this Application.


	9.
	            The Independent Directors or Independent Trustees, as applicable, of each Investment Company will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential
	Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by the other Investment Companies and the Private Funds that the applicable Investment Company considered but declined to participate in, so that the Independent
	Directors or Independent Trustees, as applicable, may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments which the applicable Investment Company considered but declined to participate in, comply with the
	conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Directors or Independent Trustees, as applicable, will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for such Investment Company of participating in new and existing Co-Investment
	Transactions.


	10.         The Investment Companies will maintain the records required by
	Section 57(f)(3) of the 1940 Act as if each of the Investment Companies were a business development company and as if each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f) of
	the 1940 Act.


	11.         No Independent Directors or Independent Trustees, as applicable, will
	also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any Private Fund.


	12.         The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities
	acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the 1933 Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective advisory
	agreements with the Investment Companies and the Private Funds, be shared by the participating Investment Companies and the participating Private Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or being acquired or disposed of, as
	the case may be.


	13.         Any transaction fee (including break-up or commitment fees but
	excluding brokers fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable) received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Investment Companies and the participating
	Private Funds on a pro rata basis, based on the amount each invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the Co-Investment Transaction, the
	fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, and such account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided
	pro


	 


	17






	rata among the participating Investment Companies and the participating Private Funds based on the amount each invests in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Investment Companies, the
	Private Funds, the Advisers, nor any affiliated person of the Investment Companies or Private Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of, or in connection with, a Co-Investment Transaction (other than
	(a) in the case of the participating Investment Companies and the participating Private Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C) and (b) in the case of the
	Advisers, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the respective investment advisory agreements).
