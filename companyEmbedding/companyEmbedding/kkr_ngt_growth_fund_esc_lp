KKR Closes $711 Million Global Next Generation Technology Growth Fund




Aims to Back Growth Companies to Build Leading Global Enterprises






December 07, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



MENLO PARK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing 
      of KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund (“NGT” or the “Fund”), a 
      $711 million fund dedicated to growth equity investment opportunities in 
      the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) space in North 
      America, Europe and Israel.
    


      The Fund is focused on generating strong returns for investors by 
      investing in market-leading, high-growth companies. Beyond access to 
      financial capital, KKR offers partner companies access to KKR’s 
      operational expertise, deep network, industry expertise, global reach 
      and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies 
      worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information 
      Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.
    

      NGT is part of KKR’s 
      TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald 
      Chen and Richard 
      Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp 
      Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David 
      Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm 
      in October from Adam Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the 
      growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise 
      technology.
    

      “We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our 
      partner companies,” said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT 
      Growth at KKR. “In today’s evolving technology landscape, the 
      combination of KKR’s global network, sourcing engine, value creation and 
      capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We 
      look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading 
      enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns 
      for our investors.”
    

      The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured 
      downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution 
      risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is 
      expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million 
      and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software 
      /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ 
      Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the 
      Internet of Things.
    

      “Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms – management 
      teams, businesses, and sectors –where we can invest to build leading 
      global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new 
      growth fund,” said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and 
      Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. “This strategy has served us well 
      and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more 
      entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level.”
    

      The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and 
      existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, 
      family offices and high net worth individual investors. “We are really 
      pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share 
      our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents,” said Alisa 
      Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.
    

      KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having 
      invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity 
      investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth 
      equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed 
      a number of transactions as part of the firm’s growth equity strategy, 
      including Optimal+, 
      GetYourGuide, 
      Jitterbit, 
      and Darktrace.

Aims to Back Growth Companies to Build Leading Global Enterprises

MENLO PARK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund ("NGT" or the "Fund"), a $711 million fund dedicated to growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) space in North America, Europe and Israel.

	The Fund is focused on generating strong returns for investors by investing in market-leading, high-growth companies. Beyond access to financial capital, KKR offers partner companies access to KKR's operational expertise, deep network, industry expertise, global reach and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.

	NGT is part of KKR's TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald Chen and Richard Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm in October from Adams Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise technology.

	"We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our partner companies," said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT Growth at KKR. "In today's evolving technology landscape, the combination of KKR's global network, sourcing engine, value creation and capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns for our investors."

	The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the Internet of Things.

	"Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms - management teams, businesses, and sectors -where we can invest to build leading global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new growth fund," said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. "This strategy has served us well and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level."

Aims to Back Growth Companies to Build Leading Global Enterprises

MENLO PARK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund ("NGT" or the "Fund"), a $711 million fund dedicated to growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) space in North America, Europe and Israel.

	The Fund is focused on generating strong returns for investors by investing in market-leading, high-growth companies. Beyond access to financial capital, KKR offers partner companies access to KKR's operational expertise, deep network, industry expertise, global reach and insights from its more than 100 current portfolio companies worldwide, which translates into over $7 billion in Information Technology spend and over $10 billion in marketing spend annually.

	NGT is part of KKR's TMT private equity platform which is led by Herald Chen and Richard Sarnoff in the Americas and Philipp Freise in Europe. Leading the TMT Growth strategy is KKR new-hire David Welsh, a veteran in the TMT growth equity space who joined the Firm in October from Adams Street Partners, where he was a Partner on the growth equity and venture capital teams focusing on enterprise technology.

	"We believe we can offer a unique set of assets and resources to our partner companies," said Mr. Welsh, Managing Director and Head of TMT Growth at KKR. "In today's evolving technology landscape, the combination of KKR's global network, sourcing engine, value creation and capital markets capabilities can help accelerate new market leaders. We look forward to leveraging our global footprint to build leading enterprises in technology, while also aiming to deliver strong returns for our investors."

	The Fund seeks to invest in secular growth areas with structured downside protection, limited leverage and will seek to take on execution risk as opposed to fundamental technology risk. In particular, NGT is expected to make equity investments amounting to less than $100 million and focused on the following themes: Business to Business Software /Software-as-a-Service, Information Technology Automation/ Infrastructure, Security, Scalable Internet /Digital Media, and the Internet of Things.

	"Our overall approach to TMT is to identify platforms - management teams, businesses, and sectors -where we can invest to build leading global TMT enterprises, whether in Private Equity or now through our new growth fund," said Herald Chen, Co-Head of TMT in North America, and Philipp Freise, Head of TMT in Europe. "This strategy has served us well and we look forward to building upon it further by helping more entrepreneurs take their companies to the next level."

	The Fund received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, family offices and high net worth individual investors. "We are really pleased with the response from investors and excited to see they share our enthusiasm for the attractive opportunities NGT presents," said Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group.

	KKR has a long record of supporting technology companies, having invested over $18 billion of equity in TMT-related private equity investments since 1983 and over $640 million in NGT-related growth equity investments since 2014. Over the last year, the Firm has executed a number of transactions as part of the firm's growth equity strategy, including Optimal+, GetYourGuide, Jitterbit, and Darktrace.
