Ingredients



Botanical Ingredients: 
Curaçao and Cape Aloe Leaf, Senna Leaf and Pod, Cascara Sagrada Aged Bark, Oregon Grape Root, Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root, Garlic Bulb, Habanero Pepper
The Powerful Ingredients
The herbs in this formula, like Aloe, Senna and Cascara Sagrada, all contain the phytochemical anthraquinone, called Emodin, which increases peristaltic waves, the propulsive contractions of the colon muscle.
Oregon Grape Root stimulates and flushes the liver and the gallbladder, and increases the production of bile Garlic is antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal Habanero and Ginger are both powerful stimulants to the colon. Ginger also relieves gas, while Habanero is a powerful aid in the intestinal healing process.





Curaçao and Cape Aloe Leaf
“The most potent and effective bowel cleansing herb in the world!”
These equatorial Aloes contain a powerful phytochemical (plant chemical) in the Anthraquinone family called Emodin.
Emodin has a very strong stimulating effect on smooth muscles like the bowel. When this chemical comes in contact with the surface of the bowel, it causes immediate and powerful muscular contractions, even though you rarely feel them. Emodin is such a powerful plant chemical that it will cause bowel contractions regardless of how constipated someone is, regardless of what they ate, regardless of their bowel disease. This Aloe Emodin worked 100% of the time with 100% of my patients. 



Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root
“One of the world’s greatest carminatives and digestive aids!”
Our Organic Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root is grown on the rain-drenched slopes of Mauna Kea, the volcanic mountainside of the Big Island of Hawaii. Our Ginger Root (actually called a Rhizome) is a vibrant yellow and much more potent, dense and less fibrous than the common White Ginger that is readily available. Yellow Ginger Rhizome is known for its depth of flavor, superior pungency and concentrated potency of phytochemicals.
Ginger’s medicinal phytochemicals are one of the world’s greatest carminatives and digestive aids Carminative action is the action of moving, relieving and expelling gas. This action makes this herb a very important ingredient to this formula. This is because during a bowel detoxification (where you remove old, encrusted fecal waste from the walls of your bowel), this material can mix with digestive fluids and create gas. Having this potent carminative in this formula neutralizes this gas and moves it down your intestinal tract for elimination.



Garlic Bulb
“Garlic has been a wonder of nature for over 4,000 years!”
Garlic keeps your entire digestive and elimination system free from harmful and toxic microbes. Whenever you are doing any bowel detoxification and cleansing, you are removing old fecal material. 
Garlic also kills the intestinal invaders that inevitably make their way into the gut and live there for years, if not treated. 
The Allicin found in Garlic is what makes it very difficult for all these invaders to thrive, which can happen especially when the diet is high in sugar and carbohydrates. 



Oregon Grape Root
“This bitter medicinal herb cleanses the liver and the bowel!”
Oregon Grape Root helps get rid of bacteria and fungi like giardia, candida, viral diarrhea, and even cholera and E. coli naturally, without harmful side effects. The digestive system is always encountering these unfriendly viruses, bacteria and fungi. 








Habanero Pepper
“The hotter the pepper, the more medicinal it is!”
These fiery Habanero Peppers stimulate the circulation so the bowel’s tissue and mucous membrane can begin to recover. 
They also increase peristalsis, the muscular contractions relieving constipation and promoting regular bowel movements. A normal, healthy bowel emits a few teaspoons of blood every day.
But, when your bowel is constipated and very dirty, it can bleed a bit more during cleansing. One of the medicinal actions of this pepper in the formula is to help stop that from happening in the bowel.



Senna Leaf and Pod
“A very reliable stool softener and bowel cleanser!”
Most companies that use Senna today use the most abundant, cheapest, common Senna Leaves from polluted countries like India and China, and then gas these herbs with toxic and carcinogenic bactericides upon importation.
No thanks! And they only use the leaf, whereas our ancestors used both the leaf and the pod, which is very potent medicinally Like our ancestors, I used both the leaf and pod, as I have found they work much better in combination than just Senna Leaf alone.
Senna stimulates the bowel to pulse more quickly, allowing more water to remain in the stool, rather than be absorbed back into the body; this makes for an easier, softer bowel movement and faster bowel action.



Cascara Sagrada Aged Bark
“Little else in nature provides such swift relief and reliable results!”
Cascara Sagrada stimulates the natural rhythmic contractions of the bowel that are more commonly known as peristalsis. It also tones the muscle wall as it works, exercising and toning the bowel muscle.
Cascara Sagrada produces a regular, satisfying bowel movement of the kind that few people in our day and age achieve on a daily basis, with the predictability of clockwork.






How It Works





Clean out accumulated waste
The human body is a metabolic engine. Every system, every organ, every cell of the human body takes in fuel to run and eliminate waste material. The majority of this waste is deposited into your colon. In fact, the average American stores from 10 to 12 pounds of fecal matter in his or her colon. If this toxic waste isn’t regularly eliminated, it will cause your body to be backed up with poisons, making it sluggish and unhealthy. Dr. Schulze designed his Intestinal Formula #1 to help his patients rid themselves of accumulated toxic waste.
Constipation causes many problems
This body of ours must have had some incredible engineer. Everything has its place and there is no extra room. If one organ swells, then another organ gets compressed or crushed. Organs don’t work well when they are crushed, and circulation gets interrupted. Every organ needs good circulation to bring nutrition in and get waste out, in order to be healthy. Your colon is so big that it is connected to, touches or is in the vicinity of every major organ in your body, except your brain. It also touches most of your blood vessels and nerves. Constipation causes the colon to swell and when this happens, it can compress the lungs, heart, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, adrenals, uterus or prostate. A constipated colon can cause an almost endless amount of seemingly unrelated diseases and problems. Intestinal Formula #1 eliminates constipation and promotes regular, complete bowel movements.
Get Healthy! Clean your colon
A sluggish, swollen bowel can compress a nearby area, causing disease and infection in any area of the body. This explains why 80% of Dr. Schulze’s patients who used Intestinal Formula #1 and did his 5-Day BOWEL Detox started to develop healthy hearts, normal blood pressure, normal blood-sugar levels, balanced hormones, no fertility problems, functioning livers, normal cholesterol levels, healthy immune systems, normal urinary function, powerful adrenals, increased energy, healthy prostates, clean digestive tracts, stronger lower backs and normal leg circulation. No matter how far removed from the colon the problem seems, cleanse the bowel first and see what happens. If you’re like Dr. Schulze’s patients, you will be thrilled with the results.



DR. SCHULZE'S CLINICAL EXPERIENCE

The best way for anyone to regain health and stay healthy is to periodically cleanse and detoxify their body of accumulated waste. My patients who did a seasonal detoxification program on a regular basis always felt healthy. Before you can make any type of healthy lifestyle changes, you must make sure that ALL of the elimination channels are open, and the bowel is the place to begin. If you clean your colon first, you should feel great during any health program and vibrant when you are finished. I started every patient in my clinic on Intestinal Formula #1, EVERY PATIENT.

My Intestinal Formula #1 is part one of my 5-Day BOWEL Detox Program. Its main medicinal action is to relieve constipation and assist you in having more regular and more complete bowel movements.
Dr. Schulze





Why You Need It





Intestinal Formula #1 relieves constipation and assists you to have more regular and more complete bowel movements. It also stimulates your colon’s natural muscle action and strengthens these muscles. It halts putrefaction, soothes and heals, improves digestion and relieves gas and discomfort from cramps. 
It also increases the flow of bile, which in turn cleans the gallbladder, bile ducts and liver and promotes healthy intestinal flora. Additionally, it makes it impossible for many intestinal invaders to survive.
NOTE: If your bowels are irritated, hot or working too frequently, skip Intestinal Formula #1 and go directly to Intestinal Formula #2. 
Why Use Intestinal Formula #1? 
FACT
The average American stores from 10 to 12 pounds of fecal waste in their colon, which is definitely not healthy.
FACT
 The average American has only two or three bowel movements a week. This makes Americans 70,000 bowel movements short in their lifetime!
FACT
 A constipated colon can cause an almost endless amount of seemingly unrelated diseases and problems. 
FACT
Americans eat more than ONE MILLION animals per hour! NO FIBER!
FACT
 In 1950, The Merck Manual (the leading medical text on the diagnosis of disease) stated that only 10% of Americans developed bowel disease. Today, it states that 100% of Americans will eventually develop bowel disease (diverticulosis) if they live long enough. Diverticuli (sac-like herniations inside your colon due to excess fecal matter build-up) are a leading precursor to colon cancer.








Testimonials






I believe it has saved my mother’s life. Formula One. Had to tell you that I do believe it has saved my mother’s life and has saved us from trips to the hospital because of abdominal pain. It is the only thing that works for her. We have tried everything, so did the hospital. We had to sneak them in the hospital for her to have a bowel movement. Told all of our friends in New York, and some in Greece and others in Albania. Formula One has traveled and helped a lot of people.
Ann A. Long Island City, NY


I am 81 years old, and since young childhood, I have gone from bowel impaction to bowel impaction. The older I got, the worse it got, to where I would sit on the toilet and cry. My husband wanted to call 9-1-1 many times. I first used your Formula #1 in Sept 2011. After a week I no longer had a problem and have not had an impaction since! I can’t thank you enough for relieving me of this lifelong misery
Bobbie B. in Lawrence, KS





I had chronic constipation and after several trips to a colon hydrotherapist, she told me about Intestinal Formula #1. The therapist who had been helping me saw how much money I was spending and directed me to your product. Now I take it each night before bed and it keeps me regular. I started with 6 capsules a day (POWERFUL DOSE) and am now taking just 2, with great results. Thank you God, and thank you Dr. Schulze for this amazing product.”
Tabitha L. in Breeding, KY


I came out of a coma and for eighteen years I could not go #2 on my own without pain and much time between. Doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I took the Intestinal Formula #1 and the very next morning went to the bathroom and had soft stools with no pain. It is amazing!

Richard M. Schulze Foundation














Home
Our Founder






Richard M. Schulze

Richard M. “Dick” Schulze, the founder of The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation, is also founder and chairman emeritus of Best Buy Co., Inc., the world’s largest multi-channel, consumer-electronic retailer.
Born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, Schulze is the ultimate entrepreneur and is living the American dream. From a modest background, he and a hand-picked team built a retailing empire based in the Twin Cities. Through it all, he adhered to his life-long values of integrity, humility, honesty, and respect – both in his professional career and his personal life. In years to come, Schulze hopes to be remembered by a personal legacy involving three major contributions through business, entrepreneurship education and philanthropy.
Best Buy
After working as a manufacturer’s representative for electronics components, in 1966 Schulze founded his own company, The Sound of Music. The business expanded to six stores in Minnesota by 1983, when Schulze renamed it Best Buy, adopted a warehouse format, and expanded into many more kinds of consumer products. The company soon went public and began a period of remarkable growth when Schulze revolutionized the industry by introducing the superstore to electronics.
Schulze served as Best Buy’s Chief Executive Officer from 1983 to 2002 and then as Chairman until 2012.  He rejoined the company in 2013 as Founder and Chairman Emeritus. Today, Best Buy employs more than 145,000 people and operates more than 1,400 stores in the U.S. and 479 stores in Canada, China and Mexico.
Entrepreneurship Education
Even though his plans to attend college never materialized, Schulze became trustee and major donor of the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota – the school where he enrolled before joining and serving full-time, active duty in the Air National Guard. In 1998, the University of St. Thomas awarded him an honorary doctoral degree. (He also holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota.)
In 2000, Schulze and his late wife, Sandy, donated $50 million to St. Thomas – then the largest donation ever to a Minnesota college or university – founding the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship in Schulze Hall, part of the university’s downtown Minneapolis campus. Founded in 2005, the Schulze School has worked to become a leader in entrepreneurship education and outreach. Students learn to turn innovative ideas into sustainable businesses and hundreds of businesses have benefitted from its expertise, consulting and start-up support.
Schulze served on the University of St. Thomas' board of trustees for 20 years, 1995-2015, before retiring from the board; he remains chairman of the university’s Opus College of Business Board of Governors.
The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation
Schulze has long supported nonprofit organizations in the Twin Cities and Minnesota. He and Sandy established the Richard M. and Sandra J. Schulze Family Fund in the mid-1990s as their main vehicle for donations to Twin Cities’ social service charities related to health care, education and family. Sandy died in 2001 from mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure.
A desire to identify and fund “transformative changes benefitting mankind” led Schulze to start The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation in 2004. In June 2013, Schulze announced plans to gradually expand the Foundation from $100 million to about $1 billion. Schulze chairs the Foundation’s board of trustees.
Always an Active Entrepreneur
Schulze currently serves as Chairman and President of Olympus Ventures, LLC, President and Director of Founders Properties, LLC, and is Founder and President of Best Jets International, a charter aircraft company that operates out of Minneapolis. He is a member of the Minnesota Business Partnership, a collective of the state’s 85 largest corporations that works alongside legislators to develop public policy.
Schulze remarried in 2002. His wife, Maureen, who is a member of the Schulze Family Foundation Board of Trustees, also lost her first spouse to mesothelioma.

Early life and education[edit]
Richard M. Schulze was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he dropped out from Central High School.[citation needed] He subsequently spent time in the U.S. Air Force with the Minnesota Air National Guard. After the Air Force, he worked as a consumer electronics salesman.[3]
He has an honorary degree from the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
In 1966, mortgaging his home, he founded an audio equipment store named Sound of Music in Saint Paul.[3] The company expanded to nine stores and after a tornado destroyed one, he had a "tornado sale" at one location with a very large selection of goods and low prices. The sale was a hit and he renamed the chain Best Buy and shifted the model to a superstore format with 18,000 square foot stores, everyday low prices, and a heavy advertising budget.[3] The format was very popular and thanks to increased demand for consumer electronics (especially with the advent of VCRs), the chain grew to forty stores in 1989.[3] Thereafter, he eliminated the commission model (customers disliked aggressive sales) and expanded Best Buy's offerings to include computer software, music, movies, and computer hardware.[3] In 1994, he increased the average store size to between 45,000 and 58,000 square feet.[3] In 1995, the chain had $5 billion in sales and 155 stores.[3] In 1996, Best Buy added appliances and kitchen utensils to its lineup.[3]
In May 2012, Richard Schulze announced that he is stepping down as Best Buy chairman after an investigation found that he knew that the CEO was having a relationship with a female employee and did not alert the audit committee.[4]
It was announced on August 6, 2012 that Richard Schulze made a bid to buy out the Best Buy company. According to the report he already owns 20% of the company. This news caused the share price of Best Buy to go up slightly.[5] By late February, talks between Best Buy Co. and Schulze ended. He and private equity investors sought three board seats in exchange for acquiring a minority stake in the company. However, he wasn't able to line up the funding [6]
On March 25, 2013 Best Buy Co. Inc. announced that Richard Schulze will rejoin the company that he founded with a new title: chairman emeritus. The Richfield, Minnesota based retailer also announced that two former executives, Brad Anderson and Al Lenzmeier, will serve as Schulze’s representatives on the board of directors. They are key Schulze allies who had advised him on his attempt to buy the company.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2000, Schulze donated $50 million to the University of St. Thomas, at the time the largest donation to a Minnesota college or university. The money went to help open the UST School of Law, featuring the prominent Schulze Grand Atrium, as well as The Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, part of the St. Thomas College of Business and located in Schulze Hall [1]; both schools are in downtown Minneapolis. Schulze sits on the Board of Governors of the UST School of Law.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Schulze lives in Bonita Springs, Florida. He is Roman Catholic and was married to Sandra J. Schulze until her death in 2001, with whom he had four children.[8] He is remarried to Maureen Schulze.[9] On November 9, 1991, Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson designated the day as Richard M. Schulze Day.

In 1966, mortgaging his home, he founded an audio equipment store named Sound of Music in Saint Paul.[3] The company expanded to nine stores and after a tornado destroyed one, he had a "tornado sale" at one location with a very large selection of goods and low prices. The sale was a hit and he renamed the chain Best Buy and shifted the model to a superstore format with 18,000 square foot stores, everyday low prices, and a heavy advertising budget.[3] The format was very popular and thanks to increased demand for consumer electronics (especially with the advent of VCRs), the chain grew to forty stores in 1989.[3] Thereafter, he eliminated the commission model (customers disliked aggressive sales) and expanded Best Buy's offerings to include computer software, music, movies, and computer hardware.[3] In 1994, he increased the average store size to between 45,000 and 58,000 square feet.[3] In 1995, the chain had $5 billion in sales and 155 stores.[3] In 1996, Best Buy added appliances and kitchen utensils to its lineup.[3]
In May 2012, Richard Schulze announced that he is stepping down as Best Buy chairman after an investigation found that he knew that the CEO was having a relationship with a female employee and did not alert the audit committee.[4]
It was announced on August 6, 2012 that Richard Schulze made a bid to buy out the Best Buy company. According to the report he already owns 20% of the company. This news caused the share price of Best Buy to go up slightly.[5] By late February, talks between Best Buy Co. and Schulze ended. He and private equity investors sought three board seats in exchange for acquiring a minority stake in the company. However, he wasn't able to line up the funding [6]
On March 25, 2013 Best Buy Co. Inc. announced that Richard Schulze will rejoin the company that he founded with a new title: chairman emeritus. The Richfield, Minnesota based retailer also announced that two former executives, Brad Anderson and Al Lenzmeier, will serve as Schulze’s representatives on the board of directors. They are key Schulze allies who had advised him on his attempt to buy the company.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2000, Schulze donated $50 million to the University of St. Thomas, at the time the largest donation to a Minnesota college or university. The money went to help open the UST School of Law, featuring the prominent Schulze Grand Atrium, as well as The Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, part of the St. Thomas College of Business and located in Schulze Hall [1]; both schools are in downtown Minneapolis. Schulze sits on the Board of Governors of the UST School of Law.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Schulze lives in Bonita Springs, Florida. He is Roman Catholic and was married to Sandra J. Schulze until her death in 2001, with whom he had four children.[8] He is remarried to Maureen Schulze.[9] On November 9, 1991, Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson designated the day as Richard M. Schulze Day.

My Story
My parents both had heart disease. They were under complete medical doctors' care. They were allowed to smoke cigarettes, drink pots of coffee and excessive alcohol, consume outrageous amounts of sugar and live on a diet of almost pure animal fat, have a bowel movement once a week or less, never exercise, and were directed to take a dozen toxic, chemical pharmaceutical drugs to try and offset their toxic and lethal lifestyle. This medical program didn't work out for them...

Twenty-eight years ago, out of desperation, Dr. Schulze made his first crude batch of SuperFood for a terminally ill patient, in the kitchen of his clinic.

Over the last three decades, Dr. Schulze continued to make this formula for his patients and customers. This formula has not only brought the sick and dying back to life, but also gave everyone else the energy and vitality they needed to enjoy life more.

Richard Schulze



Richard M. Schulze
Founder and Chairman Emeritus – Best Buy
Chairman and President – Olympus Ventures, LLC
Richard M. Schulze was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1941, and has lived in the Twin Cities area all his life. He began his working life at the age of eleven as a paperboy and held a series of jobs through high school. Although he had long dreamed of attending college and had planned to attend The College of St. Thomas, military service put him on a different path. (Dick now holds an honorary doctorate from University of St. Thomas and the University of Minnesota.) 
After working with his father for several years as a manufacturer’s representative for electronics components, Dick founded his own company in 1966, The Sound of Music, offering audio components, sheet music, records and tapes, and musical instruments, and had expanded to nine stores in Minnesota by 1983.
In the early 1980s, the consumer electronics business and retailing industry underwent rapid change with the rise of big box retailers and everyday-low-price chains. Recognizing that small music outlets could not survive, Dick reinvented his business, renamed it Best Buy, adopted a customer friendly format, and expanded its product offerings.
Dick serves as Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Best Buy; he previously served as CEO until June of 2002, when he became chair of the board. Today, Best Buy operates more than 1,400 stores in the U.S. and 479 stores in Canada, China and Mexico; employing more than 145,000 people worldwide.
Although he now divides his time between Minnesota and Florida, Dick remains deeply committed to his home state. He helped establish the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in St. Paul. He is a member of the Minnesota Business Partnership, a collective of the state’s 85 largest corporations, which works alongside legislators to develop public policy. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of UST and is Chairman of the Opus College of Business in Minneapolis.
In addition to his work with the University of St. Thomas, Dick has been involved with the Mayo Clinic and the United Way. Propelled by concern for the welfare of one of his children who lives with diabetes, Dick has worked with The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and been instrumental in supporting and helping to develop a comprehensive program with the University of Minnesota, whose goal is to eradicate the disease. After Dick’s wife Sandra passed away from a rare cancer in 2001, Schulze helped to establish the American Cancer Society Hope Lodges, homes-away-from-home for individuals undergoing cancer treatment.
The Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation was established in 2004 to fulfill the Schulze’s desire to extend the reach of their charitable work. The Foundation supports organizations that improve the lives of families and children in the areas of education, human services, medical-related human services, and camps.
Dick currently serves as the Chairman and President of Olympus Ventures, LLC, the President and Director of Founders Properties, LLC. He is also Founder and President of Best Jets International, a charter aircraft company which operates out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. He serves as a member on the board of the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation. He’s married to Maureen and has ten children and twenty nine grandchildren which is the most meaningful part of his life.

Richard M. Schulze
Biography (At time of award presentation in 2011)
Richard M. Schulze business pioneer, is the founder and chairman of Best Buy Co. Inc., a Fortune 100 company and North America's leading specialty retailer of consumer electronics. After leaving his father's business, he started his own company, Sound of Music in 1966. The store grew and bought out area competitors and soon expanded to nine stores. After his best store was destroyed by a tornado, the ever-resourceful Schulze held a "tornado sale" featuring a large selection of goods at low prices. Success followed with his company expanding into video products and appliances in the early 1980s. The name was changed to Best Buy in 1983. Throughout his career he has been committed to improving the world through education, research, and new ideas. He has helped pave the way for others to become leaders in the business community and nurtured the talents and skills of employees to grow and contribute to the betterment of their work environment. He is recognized globally for his philosophy of "unleashing the power of our people." Best Buy introduced the "Results Only Work Environment" (ROWE) workplace initiative at its Richfield, Minnesota headquarters in 2005. This initiative redirected the focus of employees and managers towards measurable results and away from a set work schedule and location. Researchers found the ROWE reduces turnover by 45 percent. Schulze is a longtime supporter of higher education. He has made personal gifts of $50 million plus a $25 million gift from his family foundation to the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship at the University of St. Thomas. He has pledged up to $40 million to the Schulze Diabetes Institute at the University of Minnesota to accelerate its pioneering efforts to cure diabetes. To honor his wife Sandra who died from a rare form of cancer, the family foundation matched, dollar for dollar, up to $7.5 million to build an American Cancer Society (ACS) Hope Lodge in Minneapolis near the University and expanded the one in Rochester, Minnesota near the Mayo Clinic. He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards including the Minnesota Business Hall of Fame (2003), the International Association of Business Communicators Excel Award (2002), Consumer Electronics Industry Hall of Fame (2000), Outstanding Marketing Executive of the Year (2000), Robert C. McDermond Medal of Excellence in Entrepreneurship (2000), Worth Magazine's Top 50 CEOs (1999), and an honorary doctorate degree (1998) from the University of St. Thomas, to name a few.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWBBY » Topics » Richard M. SchulzeThis excerpt taken from the BBY DEF 14A filed May 12, 2009.Richard M. Schulze  
We lease two of our U.S. Best Buy stores from Richard M. Schulze, a founder of Best Buy and our Chairman of the Board. During fiscal 2009, we paid aggregate rents for the
two stores leased from Mr. Schulze of $1.1 million. The leases include escalation clauses, and one provides for percentage rent based on gross sales. One of the leases was scheduled to
expire in 2008, but we exercised a renewal option in fiscal 2009 to continue to lease the store. The renewal options could extend the lease through 2021. The other lease expires in 2011 and has
renewal options that could extend the lease through 2023 at our option. We entered into both real estate leases with Mr. Schulze prior to 1990, and the Board negotiated and approved the leases
(with Mr. Schulze not voting). The Board relied on one or more of its members who had no financial interest in the properties to review market comparisons, look into alternative rental
agreements and negotiate with Mr. Schulze. The Board determined that these real estate leases were in our best interest and had terms that are competitive with terms available from unaffiliated
third parties. Real estate lease renewals are reviewed by the Audit Committee pursuant to our Related-Party Transactions Policy. 
We
also lease, on a non-exclusive basis, airplanes from a corporation owned by the Richard M. Schulze Revocable Trust, of which Mr. Schulze is a trustee. Periodically, the Board
reviews the terms of the lease agreement to ensure that they are competitive with terms available from unaffiliated third parties. We pay an hourly rate for use of the airplanes, without any required
fractional ownership. Our senior management generally use the airplanes when it is more economical or practical than flying commercial airlines. The total amount paid to Mr. Schulze's
corporation for use of the airplanes during fiscal 2009 was $895,000. 
We
purchase certain store fixtures from Phoenix Fixtures, Inc. ("Phoenix"), a company owned by Mr. Schulze's brother. Our decision to conduct business with Phoenix was based on both
qualitative and quantitative factors including product quality, pricing, customer service and design flexibility. In light of Mr. Schulze's relationship with Phoenix, the Board reviewed our
transactions with Phoenix and determined that the transactions were on fair terms to us and that Phoenix provides significant advantages with respect to service and delivery as compared with its
competitors. Accordingly, the Board approved the transactions and our continued business dealings with Phoenix. The total

We lease two of our U.S. Best Buy stores from Richard M. Schulze, a
founder of Best Buy and our Chairman of the Board. Aggregate rents paid for the
two stores leased from Mr. Schulze during fiscal 2007 were approximately
$976,000. The leases include escalation clauses, and one provides for
percentage rent based on gross sales. The leases expire in 2008 and 2011 with
renewal options that could extend the leases through 2021 and 2023,

We also lease, on a non-exclusive basis, airplanes from a corporation
owned by the Richard M. Schulze Revocable Trust, of which Mr. Schulze is a
trustee. Periodically, the Board reviews the terms of the lease agreement to
ensure that they are no less favorable than terms available from unaffiliated
third parties. We pay an hourly rate for use of the airplanes, without any
required fractional ownership. Our senior management generally use the
airplanes when it is more economical or practical than flying commercial
airlines. The total amount paid to Mr. Schulzes corporation for use of
the airplanes during fiscal 2007 was approximately $393,000.
We purchase certain store fixtures from Phoenix Fixtures, Inc. (Phoenix),
a company owned by Mr. Schulzes brother. The decision to conduct business
with Phoenix was based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including
product quality, pricing, customer service and design flexibility. The Board

respect to service and delivery as compared with its competitors. Accordingly,
the Board has approved the transactions and our continued business dealings
with Phoenix. The total amounts paid to Phoenix during fiscal 2007 were approximately
$19 million.
Susan S. Hoff, our former Senior Vice President and Chief
Communications Officer, is Mr. Schulzes daughter. As of May 1, 2006,
Ms. Hoff began serving as chairperson, president and chief executive
officer of The Best Buy Childrens Foundation, for which she has served as
president since the inception of the foundation. During fiscal 2007, Ms. Hoff
received approximately $505,000 in base salary and short-term incentives from
Best Buy. As 
40 


of May 1, 2006, Ms. Hoffs annual salary is $225,000, and she
is no longer eligible for incentives. Ms. Hoffs compensation was deemed
reasonable by the Compensation Committee based upon the responsibilities
encompassed by her role.

executive officer for more than 30 years. He is on the board of the University
of St. Thomas, chairman of its Executive and Institutional Advancement
Committee, and a member of its Board Affairs Committee. Mr. Schulze is
also chairman of the board of the University of St. Thomas Business School.

This excerpt taken from the BBY DEF 14A filed May 18, 2006.Richard M. Schulze
In June 2002,
Richard M. Schulze, a founder of Best Buy and our Chairman of the Board,
relinquished his duties as our Chief Executive Officer. At that time, we
entered into an arrangement with Mr. Schulze to pay him an annual salary
of $1 million, with annual increases based on the consumer price index,
for as long as he is physically and mentally proficient to act as Chairman,
subject to his election as a director by our shareholders. Mr. Schulzes
responsibilities as Chairman include Board oversight, strategic planning and
mentoring company officers. Mr. Schulze also periodically represents Best Buy
at public functions and actively engages with employees at designated company
functions. We reimburse Mr. Schulze for business-related expenses.
During the fiscal year ended February 25, 2006, we also reimbursed him
approximately $11,000 in the aggregate for an automobile expense allowance and
a country club membership. We also provide health insurance benefits for Mr. Schulze
and his spouse. Mr. Schulze continues to participate in our Deferred
Compensation Plan and is eligible to receive the stock options granted annually
to our directors. Mr. Schulze is not eligible to participate in any of our
other incentive compensation programs or the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
We lease two of
our U.S. Best Buy stores from Mr. Schulze. Aggregate rents paid for the
two stores leased from Mr. Schulze during fiscal 2006 were approximately
$950,000. The leases include escalation clauses, and one provides for
percentage rent based on gross sales. During fiscal 2006, we renewed both
leases. One lease now expires in 2008, and the other lease expires in 2011.
Both leases contain renewal options that could extend the leases through 2021,
at our option. We entered into the real estate leases with Mr. Schulze
prior to 1990, and the Board negotiated and approved the leases (with Mr. Schulze
not voting). The Board relied on one or more of its members who had no
financial interest in the properties to review market comparisons, look into
alternative rental agreements and negotiate with Mr. Schulze. The Board
decided that these real estate leases were in our best interest.
We also lease,
on a non-exclusive basis, airplanes from a corporation owned by the Richard M.
Schulze Revocable Trust, of which Mr. Schulze is a trustee. Periodically,
the Board reviews the terms of the lease agreement to ensure that they are no
less favorable than terms available from unaffiliated third parties. We pay an
hourly rate for use of the airplanes, without any required fractional
ownership. Our senior management generally use the airplanes when it is more
economical or practical than flying commercial airlines. The total amount paid
to 
30 


Mr. Schulzes
corporation for use of the airplanes during fiscal 2006 was approximately
$456,000.
We purchase
certain store fixtures from Phoenix Fixtures, Inc. (Phoenix), a company
owned by Mr. Schulzes brother. The decision to conduct business with
Phoenix was based on both qualitative and quantitative factors including
product quality, pricing, customer service and design flexibility. The Board
reviewed our transactions with Phoenix and determined that the transactions
were at arms length and that Phoenix provides significant advantages with
respect to service and delivery. Accordingly, the Board has approved the
transactions and our continued business dealings with Phoenix. The total
amounts paid to Phoenix during fiscal 2006 were approximately $18 million.
Susan S. Hoff,
our former Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer, is Mr. Schulzes
daughter. During fiscal 2006, Ms. Hoff received approximately $541,000 in
base salary and short-term incentives, and was awarded options to purchase
26,133 shares of Best Buy Common Stock at an exercise price of $46.80 per
share. The stock options expire in November 2015.
Brian Kraft is
employed with us as a sales representative in our Commercial Sales group and is
Mr. Schulzes stepson. During fiscal 2006, Mr. Kraft received
approximately $81,000 in base salary and short-term incentives.
Mr. Schulzes family members were compensated at levels comparable
to the compensation paid to non-family members in similar positions.
This excerpt taken from the BBY 10-K filed May 10, 2006.Richard M. Schulze
is a founder of Best Buy. He has been an officer and director from our
inception in 1966 and currently is Chairman of the Board. Effective in June 2002,
he relinquished the duties of Chief Executive Officer. He had been our
principal executive officer for more than 30 years. He is on the board of trustees
of the University of St. Thomas, chairman of its Executive and

interest. 
We
have a policy of not participating in real estate transactions with officers, directors, controlling persons and other insiders unless they are approved by the members of the Board who have no
financial interest in the transaction. Prior to Board approval, the Finance and Investment Policy Committee must first determine that any real estate transaction with an insider has terms that are
competitive with terms available from unaffiliated third parties.

short-term incentives, and was awarded options to purchase 16,150 shares of Best Buy Common Stock at a price of $55.09 per share and 
27



 

2,755
restricted shares. The stock options expire in October 2014, and the restricted shares vest over a three-year period in a range from 0% to 200% based on our achievement of
certain performance goals during such period. 
Before
his resignation in December 2004, Duane D. Hoff served as our Vice President  Business Development. Mr. Hoff is Mr. Schulze's
son-in-law. During fiscal 2005, Mr. Hoff received approximately $160,000 in base salary and short-term incentives and was awarded options to purchase 5,985
shares of Best Buy common stock at a price of $55.09 per share and 950 restricted shares. The stock options and the restricted shares were canceled upon his resignation. 
Mr. Schulze's
family members were compensated at levels comparable to the compensation paid to non-family members in similar positions.

Schulze, Richard M
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Schulze, Richard M



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Schulze, Richard M



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Ingredients



Botanical Ingredients: 
Curaçao and Cape Aloe Leaf, Senna Leaf and Pod, Cascara Sagrada Aged Bark, Oregon Grape Root, Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root, Garlic Bulb, Habanero Pepper
The Powerful Ingredients
The herbs in this formula, like Aloe, Senna and Cascara Sagrada, all contain the phytochemical anthraquinone, called Emodin, which increases peristaltic waves, the propulsive contractions of the colon muscle.
Oregon Grape Root stimulates and flushes the liver and the gallbladder, and increases the production of bile Garlic is antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal Habanero and Ginger are both powerful stimulants to the colon. Ginger also relieves gas, while Habanero is a powerful aid in the intestinal healing process.





Curaçao and Cape Aloe Leaf
“The most potent and effective bowel cleansing herb in the world!”
These equatorial Aloes contain a powerful phytochemical (plant chemical) in the Anthraquinone family called Emodin.
Emodin has a very strong stimulating effect on smooth muscles like the bowel. When this chemical comes in contact with the surface of the bowel, it causes immediate and powerful muscular contractions, even though you rarely feel them. Emodin is such a powerful plant chemical that it will cause bowel contractions regardless of how constipated someone is, regardless of what they ate, regardless of their bowel disease. This Aloe Emodin worked 100% of the time with 100% of my patients. 



Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root
“One of the world’s greatest carminatives and digestive aids!”
Our Organic Hawaiian Yellow Ginger Root is grown on the rain-drenched slopes of Mauna Kea, the volcanic mountainside of the Big Island of Hawaii. Our Ginger Root (actually called a Rhizome) is a vibrant yellow and much more potent, dense and less fibrous than the common White Ginger that is readily available. Yellow Ginger Rhizome is known for its depth of flavor, superior pungency and concentrated potency of phytochemicals.
Ginger’s medicinal phytochemicals are one of the world’s greatest carminatives and digestive aids Carminative action is the action of moving, relieving and expelling gas. This action makes this herb a very important ingredient to this formula. This is because during a bowel detoxification (where you remove old, encrusted fecal waste from the walls of your bowel), this material can mix with digestive fluids and create gas. Having this potent carminative in this formula neutralizes this gas and moves it down your intestinal tract for elimination.



Garlic Bulb
“Garlic has been a wonder of nature for over 4,000 years!”
Garlic keeps your entire digestive and elimination system free from harmful and toxic microbes. Whenever you are doing any bowel detoxification and cleansing, you are removing old fecal material. 
Garlic also kills the intestinal invaders that inevitably make their way into the gut and live there for years, if not treated. 
The Allicin found in Garlic is what makes it very difficult for all these invaders to thrive, which can happen especially when the diet is high in sugar and carbohydrates. 



Oregon Grape Root
“This bitter medicinal herb cleanses the liver and the bowel!”
Oregon Grape Root helps get rid of bacteria and fungi like giardia, candida, viral diarrhea, and even cholera and E. coli naturally, without harmful side effects. The digestive system is always encountering these unfriendly viruses, bacteria and fungi. 








Habanero Pepper
“The hotter the pepper, the more medicinal it is!”
These fiery Habanero Peppers stimulate the circulation so the bowel’s tissue and mucous membrane can begin to recover. 
They also increase peristalsis, the muscular contractions relieving constipation and promoting regular bowel movements. A normal, healthy bowel emits a few teaspoons of blood every day.
But, when your bowel is constipated and very dirty, it can bleed a bit more during cleansing. One of the medicinal actions of this pepper in the formula is to help stop that from happening in the bowel.



Senna Leaf and Pod
“A very reliable stool softener and bowel cleanser!”
Most companies that use Senna today use the most abundant, cheapest, common Senna Leaves from polluted countries like India and China, and then gas these herbs with toxic and carcinogenic bactericides upon importation.
No thanks! And they only use the leaf, whereas our ancestors used both the leaf and the pod, which is very potent medicinally Like our ancestors, I used both the leaf and pod, as I have found they work much better in combination than just Senna Leaf alone.
Senna stimulates the bowel to pulse more quickly, allowing more water to remain in the stool, rather than be absorbed back into the body; this makes for an easier, softer bowel movement and faster bowel action.



Cascara Sagrada Aged Bark
“Little else in nature provides such swift relief and reliable results!”
Cascara Sagrada stimulates the natural rhythmic contractions of the bowel that are more commonly known as peristalsis. It also tones the muscle wall as it works, exercising and toning the bowel muscle.
Cascara Sagrada produces a regular, satisfying bowel movement of the kind that few people in our day and age achieve on a daily basis, with the predictability of clockwork.






How It Works





Clean out accumulated waste
The human body is a metabolic engine. Every system, every organ, every cell of the human body takes in fuel to run and eliminate waste material. The majority of this waste is deposited into your colon. In fact, the average American stores from 10 to 12 pounds of fecal matter in his or her colon. If this toxic waste isn’t regularly eliminated, it will cause your body to be backed up with poisons, making it sluggish and unhealthy. Dr. Schulze designed his Intestinal Formula #1 to help his patients rid themselves of accumulated toxic waste.
Constipation causes many problems
This body of ours must have had some incredible engineer. Everything has its place and there is no extra room. If one organ swells, then another organ gets compressed or crushed. Organs don’t work well when they are crushed, and circulation gets interrupted. Every organ needs good circulation to bring nutrition in and get waste out, in order to be healthy. Your colon is so big that it is connected to, touches or is in the vicinity of every major organ in your body, except your brain. It also touches most of your blood vessels and nerves. Constipation causes the colon to swell and when this happens, it can compress the lungs, heart, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, adrenals, uterus or prostate. A constipated colon can cause an almost endless amount of seemingly unrelated diseases and problems. Intestinal Formula #1 eliminates constipation and promotes regular, complete bowel movements.
Get Healthy! Clean your colon
A sluggish, swollen bowel can compress a nearby area, causing disease and infection in any area of the body. This explains why 80% of Dr. Schulze’s patients who used Intestinal Formula #1 and did his 5-Day BOWEL Detox started to develop healthy hearts, normal blood pressure, normal blood-sugar levels, balanced hormones, no fertility problems, functioning livers, normal cholesterol levels, healthy immune systems, normal urinary function, powerful adrenals, increased energy, healthy prostates, clean digestive tracts, stronger lower backs and normal leg circulation. No matter how far removed from the colon the problem seems, cleanse the bowel first and see what happens. If you’re like Dr. Schulze’s patients, you will be thrilled with the results.



DR. SCHULZE'S CLINICAL EXPERIENCE

The best way for anyone to regain health and stay healthy is to periodically cleanse and detoxify their body of accumulated waste. My patients who did a seasonal detoxification program on a regular basis always felt healthy. Before you can make any type of healthy lifestyle changes, you must make sure that ALL of the elimination channels are open, and the bowel is the place to begin. If you clean your colon first, you should feel great during any health program and vibrant when you are finished. I started every patient in my clinic on Intestinal Formula #1, EVERY PATIENT.

My Intestinal Formula #1 is part one of my 5-Day BOWEL Detox Program. Its main medicinal action is to relieve constipation and assist you in having more regular and more complete bowel movements.
Dr. Schulze





Why You Need It





Intestinal Formula #1 relieves constipation and assists you to have more regular and more complete bowel movements. It also stimulates your colon’s natural muscle action and strengthens these muscles. It halts putrefaction, soothes and heals, improves digestion and relieves gas and discomfort from cramps. 
It also increases the flow of bile, which in turn cleans the gallbladder, bile ducts and liver and promotes healthy intestinal flora. Additionally, it makes it impossible for many intestinal invaders to survive.
NOTE: If your bowels are irritated, hot or working too frequently, skip Intestinal Formula #1 and go directly to Intestinal Formula #2. 
Why Use Intestinal Formula #1? 
FACT
The average American stores from 10 to 12 pounds of fecal waste in their colon, which is definitely not healthy.
FACT
 The average American has only two or three bowel movements a week. This makes Americans 70,000 bowel movements short in their lifetime!
FACT
 A constipated colon can cause an almost endless amount of seemingly unrelated diseases and problems. 
FACT
Americans eat more than ONE MILLION animals per hour! NO FIBER!
FACT
 In 1950, The Merck Manual (the leading medical text on the diagnosis of disease) stated that only 10% of Americans developed bowel disease. Today, it states that 100% of Americans will eventually develop bowel disease (diverticulosis) if they live long enough. Diverticuli (sac-like herniations inside your colon due to excess fecal matter build-up) are a leading precursor to colon cancer.








Testimonials






I believe it has saved my mother’s life. Formula One. Had to tell you that I do believe it has saved my mother’s life and has saved us from trips to the hospital because of abdominal pain. It is the only thing that works for her. We have tried everything, so did the hospital. We had to sneak them in the hospital for her to have a bowel movement. Told all of our friends in New York, and some in Greece and others in Albania. Formula One has traveled and helped a lot of people.
Ann A. Long Island City, NY


I am 81 years old, and since young childhood, I have gone from bowel impaction to bowel impaction. The older I got, the worse it got, to where I would sit on the toilet and cry. My husband wanted to call 9-1-1 many times. I first used your Formula #1 in Sept 2011. After a week I no longer had a problem and have not had an impaction since! I can’t thank you enough for relieving me of this lifelong misery
Bobbie B. in Lawrence, KS





I had chronic constipation and after several trips to a colon hydrotherapist, she told me about Intestinal Formula #1. The therapist who had been helping me saw how much money I was spending and directed me to your product. Now I take it each night before bed and it keeps me regular. I started with 6 capsules a day (POWERFUL DOSE) and am now taking just 2, with great results. Thank you God, and thank you Dr. Schulze for this amazing product.”
Tabitha L. in Breeding, KY


I came out of a coma and for eighteen years I could not go #2 on my own without pain and much time between. Doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I took the Intestinal Formula #1 and the very next morning went to the bathroom and had soft stools with no pain. It is amazing!
Melissa V. Palm Harbor, FL

Early life and education[edit]
Richard M. Schulze was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he dropped out from Central High School.[citation needed] He subsequently spent time in the U.S. Air Force with the Minnesota Air National Guard. After the Air Force, he worked as a consumer electronics salesman.[3]
He has an honorary degree from the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
In 1966, mortgaging his home, he founded an audio equipment store named Sound of Music in Saint Paul.[3] The company expanded to nine stores and after a tornado destroyed one, he had a "tornado sale" at one location with a very large selection of goods and low prices. The sale was a hit and he renamed the chain Best Buy and shifted the model to a superstore format with 18,000 square foot stores, everyday low prices, and a heavy advertising budget.[3] The format was very popular and thanks to increased demand for consumer electronics (especially with the advent of VCRs), the chain grew to forty stores in 1989.[3] Thereafter, he eliminated the commission model (customers disliked aggressive sales) and expanded Best Buy's offerings to include computer software, music, movies, and computer hardware.[3] In 1994, he increased the average store size to between 45,000 and 58,000 square feet.[3] In 1995, the chain had $5 billion in sales and 155 stores.[3] In 1996, Best Buy added appliances and kitchen utensils to its lineup.[3]
In May 2012, Richard Schulze announced that he is stepping down as Best Buy chairman after an investigation found that he knew that the CEO was having a relationship with a female employee and did not alert the audit committee.[4]
It was announced on August 6, 2012 that Richard Schulze made a bid to buy out the Best Buy company. According to the report he already owns 20% of the company. This news caused the share price of Best Buy to go up slightly.[5] By late February, talks between Best Buy Co. and Schulze ended. He and private equity investors sought three board seats in exchange for acquiring a minority stake in the company. However, he wasn't able to line up the funding [6]
On March 25, 2013 Best Buy Co. Inc. announced that Richard Schulze will rejoin the company that he founded with a new title: chairman emeritus. The Richfield, Minnesota based retailer also announced that two former executives, Brad Anderson and Al Lenzmeier, will serve as Schulze’s representatives on the board of directors. They are key Schulze allies who had advised him on his attempt to buy the company.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2000, Schulze donated $50 million to the University of St. Thomas, at the time the largest donation to a Minnesota college or university. The money went to help open the UST School of Law, featuring the prominent Schulze Grand Atrium, as well as The Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, part of the St. Thomas College of Business and located in Schulze Hall [1]; both schools are in downtown Minneapolis. Schulze sits on the Board of Governors of the UST School of Law.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Schulze lives in Bonita Springs, Florida. He is Roman Catholic and was married to Sandra J. Schulze until her death in 2001, with whom he had four children.[8] He is remarried to Maureen Schulze.[9] On November 9, 1991, Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson designated the day as Richard M. Schulze Day.

Schulze lives in Bonita Springs, Florida. He is Roman Catholic and was married to Sandra J. Schulze until her death in 2001, with whom he had four children.[8] He is remarried to Maureen Schulze.[9] On November 9, 1991, Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson designated the day as Richard M. Schulze Day.

Early life and education[edit]
Richard M. Schulze was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he dropped out from Central High School.[citation needed] He subsequently spent time in the U.S. Air Force with the Minnesota Air National Guard. After the Air Force, he worked as a consumer electronics salesman.[3]
He has an honorary degree from the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
In 1966, mortgaging his home, he founded an audio equipment store named Sound of Music in Saint Paul.[3] The company expanded to nine stores and after a tornado destroyed one, he had a "tornado sale" at one location with a very large selection of goods and low prices. The sale was a hit and he renamed the chain Best Buy and shifted the model to a superstore format with 18,000 square foot stores, everyday low prices, and a heavy advertising budget.[3] The format was very popular and thanks to increased demand for consumer electronics (especially with the advent of VCRs), the chain grew to forty stores in 1989.[3] Thereafter, he eliminated the commission model (customers disliked aggressive sales) and expanded Best Buy's offerings to include computer software, music, movies, and computer hardware.[3] In 1994, he increased the average store size to between 45,000 and 58,000 square feet.[3] In 1995, the chain had $5 billion in sales and 155 stores.[3] In 1996, Best Buy added appliances and kitchen utensils to its lineup.[3]
In May 2012, Richard Schulze announced that he is stepping down as Best Buy chairman after an investigation found that he knew that the CEO was having a relationship with a female employee and did not alert the audit committee.[4]
It was announced on August 6, 2012 that Richard Schulze made a bid to buy out the Best Buy company. According to the report he already owns 20% of the company. This news caused the share price of Best Buy to go up slightly.[5] By late February, talks between Best Buy Co. and Schulze ended. He and private equity investors sought three board seats in exchange for acquiring a minority stake in the company. However, he wasn't able to line up the funding [6]
On March 25, 2013 Best Buy Co. Inc. announced that Richard Schulze will rejoin the company that he founded with a new title: chairman emeritus. The Richfield, Minnesota based retailer also announced that two former executives, Brad Anderson and Al Lenzmeier, will serve as Schulze’s representatives on the board of directors. They are key Schulze allies who had advised him on his attempt to buy the company.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2000, Schulze donated $50 million to the University of St. Thomas, at the time the largest donation to a Minnesota college or university. The money went to help open the UST School of Law, featuring the prominent Schulze Grand Atrium, as well as The Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, part of the St. Thomas College of Business and located in Schulze Hall [1]; both schools are in downtown Minneapolis. Schulze sits on the Board of Governors of the UST School of Law.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Schulze lives in Bonita Springs, Florida. He is Roman Catholic and was married to Sandra J. Schulze until her death in 2001, with whom he had four children.[8] He is remarried to Maureen Schulze.[9] On November 9, 1991, Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson designated the day as Richard M. Schulze Day.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
