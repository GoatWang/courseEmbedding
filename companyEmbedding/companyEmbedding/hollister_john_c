A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Hollister relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Hollister, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Hollister issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017. For more information about the settlement, please visit: www.hollisterclassaction.com.

Understanding Your Ostomy
Every year, thousands of people undergo colostomy, ileostomy, or urostomy surgeries. Learn more about what to expect.





Types of Ostomies
                            


Colostomy
A colostomy is a surgically created opening into the colon through the abdomen. Its purpose is to allow the stool to bypass a diseased or damaged part of the colon. The output from a colostomy includes liquid or formed stool (or somewhere in between), gas, and odor.
Ileostomy
An ileostomy is a surgically created opening into the small intestine through the abdomen. With an ileostomy, a section of the small intestine and large intestine (colon) have been removed or bypassed. The output from an ileostomy after surgery is generally a steady liquid type of drainage. Over time though the stool will become thicker and more paste-like.
Urostomy
A urostomy is a surgically created opening to drain urine. A urostomy allows urine to flow out of the body after the bladder has been removed or bypassed. The output from a urostomy is urine and possibly some mucus.

What's right for me?
                                    Are you sure you are using the right pouch? Products used successfully in the hospital are not always the best ones to use once you are home and active.

  GIFT CARDS


  FIND A STORE

























A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Hollister relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Hollister, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Hollister issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017. For more information about the settlement, please visit: www.hollisterclassaction.com.
