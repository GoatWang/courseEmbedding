The DOUBLE DEER DRAG is the first and only IN-LINE DEER DRAGGING system. It enables TWO draggers to easily drag their deer, in the most direct route from the thickest of cover. It is simple, efficient, and far more effective than the traditional rope and stick. The IN-Line concept allows the two draggers work with each other, continually transferring the maximum amount for forward energy to the deer.

Allows TWO draggers to walk single file through the thickest of cover taking the most direct route out of the woods
Reduces the per person load by 50%
Evenly distributes the load between the two draggers
Fits easily into your hunting pack
Can be easily attached to any plastic deer sled to provide all of the advantages above.
