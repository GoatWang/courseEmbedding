Marathon gasoline is certified Top Tier, providing a higher level of STP detergent additive for an even greater cleaning power. Marathon gasoline fights the accumulation of harmful deposits and improves the performance of your vehicle's engine.










Optimizes Fuel Economy.Deposits in engines can reduce fuel economy. Compared to gasolines using only the minimum EPA required dose of detergent additives, Marathon gasolines with STP additives can increase fuel efficiency by improving the cleanliness of an engine’s intake valves.
Removes Deposit Buildup.Marathon gasolines with STP additives provide deposit control detergents that remove the buildup of performance-robbing deposits. Marathon gasolines are specifically formulated to help maintain engine cleanliness, therefore, improve engine quality.






Reduces Emissions.By keeping intake valves clean, engines have fewer deposits, which can lower harmful emissions like nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide in engine exhaust. Marathon gasolines with STP additives clean engine intake valves and reduce emissions.
Restores Lost Power.Marathon gasolines with STP additives can remove deposits in your engine’s intake valves. Lower quality gasolines have the potential to leave more deposits, which will have a negative impact on your vehicle’s performance. A cleaner engine will keep your vehicle running its best.

Asphalt
Marathon Petroleum Company LP (MPC) is a major producer and marketer of liquid asphalt used primarily as a binder in constructing and maintaining road surfaces. The liquid asphalt is combined with aggregate to produce Hot Mix Asphalt, used for roadways. Other uses for asphalt include the manufacture of roofing products.
Production Information  MPC has the largest domestic asphalt production capacity in the United States, producing base asphalt binders from four of its seven refineries which are: Canton, Ohio; Catlettsburg, Ky.; Detroit, Mich.; and Garyville, La.
Transportation  Asphalt must be kept hot to remain a liquid and is generally shipped at temperatures exceeding 270 degrees Fahrenheit via barge, rail or transport truck. Pipelines can not be used to move this product great distances efficiently due to temperature constraints.
MarketingMPC markets asphalt through 18 company-owned and -operated and two third-party terminals located throughout the Midwest and Southeast. The MPC customer base includes asphalt paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities, and townships), and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. In addition, MPC makes domestic U.S. barge sales in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. Any export sale is sold F.O.B. Garyville, La., as inventories permit.

Air Products to Supply Additional Hydrogen for Marathon Petroleum

				Mar 6, 2017				9:16 am EDT            










Air Products to supply additional hydrogen for Marathon Petroleum
On March 1, 2017, Air Products and Chemicals (APD) announced that it had signed an agreement with Marathon Petroleum to supply approximately 30 million standard cubic feet of additional hydrogen per day at its Garyville, Louisiana refinery. APD already supplies hydrogen to Marathon Petroleum. The new supply of hydrogen is expected to begin in November 2017. However, APD didn’t disclose the financial details of the agreement.

Marie Folkes, president of industrial gases in the Americas region, said, “We are pleased to increase our hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum at Garyville. Marathon Petroleum is a valued long-term customer of Air Products, and we serve several of their refineries in the United States.” The additional hydrogen will be provided to Marathon Petroleum from Air Products’ existing gulf coast pipeline.



APD’s stock price for the week
For the week ended March 3, 2017, Air Products and Chemicals closed at $139.52, losing 1.0% for the week. APD’s stock price traded 1.2% below the 100-day moving average price of $141.20, indicating a reversal in the trend from the previous week when it was trading above the 100-day moving average price. On a year-to-date basis, APD lost 3.0%. APD’s 14-day relative strength index (or RSI) of 44 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. An RSI of 70 indicates that the stock is overbought and a score of 30 suggests that the stock is oversold. APD’s 52-week low is $122.03, and its 52-week high is $150.45.
Air Products and Chemicals underperformed the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (RTM), which rose 0.8% for the week ended March 3, 2017. RTM invests 3.7% of its portfolio in APD. Some top holdings of the fund include CF Industries (CF), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), and Newmont Mining (NEM), which have weights of 4.5%, 4.4%, and 4.3%, respectively.

A 20.4% interest, including a controlling 2% general partner interest, in MPLX, a public master limited partnership that owns pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil. NYSE: MPLX [1]

History[edit]
Marathon Petroleum Corporation was formed on November 9, 2005 as a subsidiary of Marathon Oil.
Former parent company[edit]
Marathon Oil, the company's former parent, dates back to 1887 when several small oil companies in Ohio banded together to form The Ohio Oil Company.[3] From 1982 until 2002, Marathon Oil was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel.
Predecessor company[edit]
The predecessor company of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, formerly known as Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, was formed by the merger of the refining operations of Marathon Oil and Ashland Inc. in 1998. In 2005, the company became a 100% owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil. [4]
In 2006, Marathon began using STP-branded additives in its gasoline.[5]
In 2009, the company completed a $3.9 billion expansion of its refinery in Garyville, Louisiana that increased the plant’s capacity by 180,000 barrels per day.[4]
In 2010, the company sold its 74,000 barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota along with associated terminals, pipelines, and inventory as well as 166 SuperAmerica convenience stores to Northern Tier Energy for $900 million.[6]
Post-corporate spin-off from Marathon Oil[edit]
On June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil distributed all of its shares in the company to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off.[1]
In June 2012, Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tri-State Petroleum signed a contract to switch 50 stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to the Marathon brand. Most of Tri-State's stations before the deal were ExxonMobil-branded stations, the majority Exxon as well as a few scattered Mobil stations in the immediate Wheeling area. Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based. (Exxon would offset its Pittsburgh losses by taking over the retail contracts of several Shell stations in the area, leaving Shell with a significantly reduced presence, while the Mobil brand was withdrawn from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia altogether.) Before the deal, Marathon had a much smaller presence in Western Pennsylvania, while having a somewhat larger presence in West Virginia and an almost ubiquitous presence in Southern Ohio.[7]
In 2013, Marathon purchased numerous assets from BP including a 451,000 barrel per day refinery in Texas City, Texas, four light product distribution terminals, and retail marketing contracts for 1,200 retail stations throughout the southeastern United States.[8]
In 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of the company, purchased the retail operations of Hess Corporation for $2.82 billion.[9]
Refinery fire[edit]
In 2016, a fire at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas injured three contract workers, resulting in a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages.[10]

History[edit]
Marathon Petroleum Corporation was formed on November 9, 2005 as a subsidiary of Marathon Oil.
Former parent company[edit]
Marathon Oil, the company's former parent, dates back to 1887 when several small oil companies in Ohio banded together to form The Ohio Oil Company.[3] From 1982 until 2002, Marathon Oil was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel.
Predecessor company[edit]
The predecessor company of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, formerly known as Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, was formed by the merger of the refining operations of Marathon Oil and Ashland Inc. in 1998. In 2005, the company became a 100% owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil. [4]
In 2006, Marathon began using STP-branded additives in its gasoline.[5]
In 2009, the company completed a $3.9 billion expansion of its refinery in Garyville, Louisiana that increased the plant’s capacity by 180,000 barrels per day.[4]
In 2010, the company sold its 74,000 barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota along with associated terminals, pipelines, and inventory as well as 166 SuperAmerica convenience stores to Northern Tier Energy for $900 million.[6]
Post-corporate spin-off from Marathon Oil[edit]
On June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil distributed all of its shares in the company to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off.[1]
In June 2012, Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tri-State Petroleum signed a contract to switch 50 stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to the Marathon brand. Most of Tri-State's stations before the deal were ExxonMobil-branded stations, the majority Exxon as well as a few scattered Mobil stations in the immediate Wheeling area. Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based. (Exxon would offset its Pittsburgh losses by taking over the retail contracts of several Shell stations in the area, leaving Shell with a significantly reduced presence, while the Mobil brand was withdrawn from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia altogether.) Before the deal, Marathon had a much smaller presence in Western Pennsylvania, while having a somewhat larger presence in West Virginia and an almost ubiquitous presence in Southern Ohio.[7]
In 2013, Marathon purchased numerous assets from BP including a 451,000 barrel per day refinery in Texas City, Texas, four light product distribution terminals, and retail marketing contracts for 1,200 retail stations throughout the southeastern United States.[8]
In 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of the company, purchased the retail operations of Hess Corporation for $2.82 billion.[9]
Refinery fire[edit]
In 2016, a fire at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas injured three contract workers, resulting in a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages.[10]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Marathon Petroleum Corporation was formed on November 9, 2005 as a subsidiary of Marathon Oil.
Former parent company[edit]
Marathon Oil, the company's former parent, dates back to 1887 when several small oil companies in Ohio banded together to form The Ohio Oil Company.[3] From 1982 until 2002, Marathon Oil was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel.
Predecessor company[edit]
The predecessor company of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, formerly known as Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, was formed by the merger of the refining operations of Marathon Oil and Ashland Inc. in 1998. In 2005, the company became a 100% owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil. [4]
In 2006, Marathon began using STP-branded additives in its gasoline.[5]
In 2009, the company completed a $3.9 billion expansion of its refinery in Garyville, Louisiana that increased the plant’s capacity by 180,000 barrels per day.[4]
In 2010, the company sold its 74,000 barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota along with associated terminals, pipelines, and inventory as well as 166 SuperAmerica convenience stores to Northern Tier Energy for $900 million.[6]
Post-corporate spin-off from Marathon Oil[edit]
On June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil distributed all of its shares in the company to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off.[1]
In June 2012, Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tri-State Petroleum signed a contract to switch 50 stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to the Marathon brand. Most of Tri-State's stations before the deal were ExxonMobil-branded stations, the majority Exxon as well as a few scattered Mobil stations in the immediate Wheeling area. Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based. (Exxon would offset its Pittsburgh losses by taking over the retail contracts of several Shell stations in the area, leaving Shell with a significantly reduced presence, while the Mobil brand was withdrawn from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia altogether.) Before the deal, Marathon had a much smaller presence in Western Pennsylvania, while having a somewhat larger presence in West Virginia and an almost ubiquitous presence in Southern Ohio.[7]
In 2013, Marathon purchased numerous assets from BP including a 451,000 barrel per day refinery in Texas City, Texas, four light product distribution terminals, and retail marketing contracts for 1,200 retail stations throughout the southeastern United States.[8]
In 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of the company, purchased the retail operations of Hess Corporation for $2.82 billion.[9]
Refinery fire[edit]
In 2016, a fire at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas injured three contract workers, resulting in a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages.[10]

History[edit]
Marathon Petroleum Corporation was formed on November 9, 2005 as a subsidiary of Marathon Oil.
Former parent company[edit]
Marathon Oil, the company's former parent, dates back to 1887 when several small oil companies in Ohio banded together to form The Ohio Oil Company.[3] From 1982 until 2002, Marathon Oil was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel.
Predecessor company[edit]
The predecessor company of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, formerly known as Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, was formed by the merger of the refining operations of Marathon Oil and Ashland Inc. in 1998. In 2005, the company became a 100% owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil. [4]
In 2006, Marathon began using STP-branded additives in its gasoline.[5]
In 2009, the company completed a $3.9 billion expansion of its refinery in Garyville, Louisiana that increased the plant’s capacity by 180,000 barrels per day.[4]
In 2010, the company sold its 74,000 barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota along with associated terminals, pipelines, and inventory as well as 166 SuperAmerica convenience stores to Northern Tier Energy for $900 million.[6]
Post-corporate spin-off from Marathon Oil[edit]
On June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil distributed all of its shares in the company to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off.[1]
In June 2012, Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tri-State Petroleum signed a contract to switch 50 stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to the Marathon brand. Most of Tri-State's stations before the deal were ExxonMobil-branded stations, the majority Exxon as well as a few scattered Mobil stations in the immediate Wheeling area. Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based. (Exxon would offset its Pittsburgh losses by taking over the retail contracts of several Shell stations in the area, leaving Shell with a significantly reduced presence, while the Mobil brand was withdrawn from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia altogether.) Before the deal, Marathon had a much smaller presence in Western Pennsylvania, while having a somewhat larger presence in West Virginia and an almost ubiquitous presence in Southern Ohio.[7]
In 2013, Marathon purchased numerous assets from BP including a 451,000 barrel per day refinery in Texas City, Texas, four light product distribution terminals, and retail marketing contracts for 1,200 retail stations throughout the southeastern United States.[8]
In 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of the company, purchased the retail operations of Hess Corporation for $2.82 billion.[9]
Refinery fire[edit]
In 2016, a fire at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas injured three contract workers, resulting in a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages.[10]

History[edit]
Marathon Petroleum Corporation was formed on November 9, 2005 as a subsidiary of Marathon Oil.
Former parent company[edit]
Marathon Oil, the company's former parent, dates back to 1887 when several small oil companies in Ohio banded together to form The Ohio Oil Company.[3] From 1982 until 2002, Marathon Oil was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel.
Predecessor company[edit]
The predecessor company of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC, formerly known as Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, was formed by the merger of the refining operations of Marathon Oil and Ashland Inc. in 1998. In 2005, the company became a 100% owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil. [4]
In 2006, Marathon began using STP-branded additives in its gasoline.[5]
In 2009, the company completed a $3.9 billion expansion of its refinery in Garyville, Louisiana that increased the plant’s capacity by 180,000 barrels per day.[4]
In 2010, the company sold its 74,000 barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park, Minnesota along with associated terminals, pipelines, and inventory as well as 166 SuperAmerica convenience stores to Northern Tier Energy for $900 million.[6]
Post-corporate spin-off from Marathon Oil[edit]
On June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil distributed all of its shares in the company to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off.[1]
In June 2012, Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tri-State Petroleum signed a contract to switch 50 stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to the Marathon brand. Most of Tri-State's stations before the deal were ExxonMobil-branded stations, the majority Exxon as well as a few scattered Mobil stations in the immediate Wheeling area. Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based. (Exxon would offset its Pittsburgh losses by taking over the retail contracts of several Shell stations in the area, leaving Shell with a significantly reduced presence, while the Mobil brand was withdrawn from the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia altogether.) Before the deal, Marathon had a much smaller presence in Western Pennsylvania, while having a somewhat larger presence in West Virginia and an almost ubiquitous presence in Southern Ohio.[7]
In 2013, Marathon purchased numerous assets from BP including a 451,000 barrel per day refinery in Texas City, Texas, four light product distribution terminals, and retail marketing contracts for 1,200 retail stations throughout the southeastern United States.[8]
In 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of the company, purchased the retail operations of Hess Corporation for $2.82 billion.[9]
Refinery fire[edit]
In 2016, a fire at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas injured three contract workers, resulting in a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages.[10]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
