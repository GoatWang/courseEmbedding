MERGER

Section 3.1 Effects of the
Merger.

(a) The Merger . At the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Frontier, Cowboy or Merger Sub or the holders
of any shares of Cowboy common stock, par value $0.10 per share
(the “ Cowboy Common Stock ”):

(i) Each share of Cowboy Common
Stock, if any, then held by Cowboy or any Wholly Owned Cowboy
Subsidiary or held in Cowboy’s treasury (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include shares of Cowboy Common Stock
held in any Cowboy Equity Incentive Plan or in any related trust
accounts (including any shares of Cowboy Common Stock held in a
rabbi trust) or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity)
shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid, nor shall any other payment or right
inure or be made with respect thereto in connection with or as a
consequence of the Merger;

(ii) Each share of Cowboy Common
Stock, if any, then held by Frontier or any Wholly Owned Frontier
Subsidiary shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
paid, nor shall any other payment or right inure or be made with
respect thereto in connection with or as a consequence of the
Merger;

(iii) Except as provided in
Section 3.1(a)(i) and Section 3.1(a)(ii)
and subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(d) , each
share of Cowboy Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be automatically cancelled and
retired and converted into the right to receive (upon the proper
surrender of the certificate representing such share (“
Certificate ”) or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share,
the proper surrender of such Book-Entry Share) that number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Frontier (“ Frontier
Common Stock ”) equal to the Exchange Ratio. For purposes
of this Agreement, “ Exchange Ratio ” means
0.840. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Cowboy Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
(A) shares of Frontier Common Stock to be issued in
consideration therefore upon the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and (B) any cash, without interest, to be
paid in lieu of any fractional share interests of Frontier Common
Stock in accordance with Section 3.1(d) (the “
Merger Consideration ”);

(iv) The membership interests of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain the issued and outstanding membership
interests of the Surviving Entity and shall be unaffected by the
Merger; and
 
14



(v) At the Effective Time, each
share of Frontier Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding.
Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of Frontier Common
Stock owned by Surviving Entity or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Surviving Entity shall be surrendered to Frontier without payment
therefor.

(b) Adjustment of the Exchange
Ratio . Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, if any of Cowboy or Frontier should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify either the Cowboy Common Stock or the Frontier
Common Stock or makes a dividend or other distribution in shares of
the Cowboy Common Stock or the Frontier Common Stock (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Cowboy Common Stock or Frontier Common Stock), or engages in a
reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change,
then (without limiting any other rights of the Parties hereunder),
the Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any such split, combination, reclassification, dividend,
distribution, reorganization, exchange or change, and thereafter
all references to the Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be the
Exchange Ratio as so adjusted.

(c) Transfer Books . From and
after the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Cowboy shall
be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Cowboy Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, Persons who held Cowboy Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock presented to the Exchange
Agent, Frontier or the Surviving Entity shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration with respect to Cowboy Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

(d) No Fractional Shares . No
certificates representing fractional shares of Frontier Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Frontier.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Cowboy Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Frontier Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock delivered
by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent,
determined by multiplying (i) the per share Nasdaq Official
Closing Price of the Frontier Common Stock (as reported on
www.nasdaq.com) on the date immediately preceding the date on which
the Effective Time shall occur (or, if the Frontier Common Stock
did not trade on the NASDAQ on such prior date, the last day of
trading in Frontier Common Stock on the NASDAQ prior to the
Effective Time) by (ii) the fraction of a share of Frontier
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled.

Section 3.2 Exchange
Procedures; Exchange Agent; Distributions with Respect to
Unexchanged Shares.

(a) As soon as practicable prior to
the Effective Time (but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the mailing date of the Joint Proxy
Statement), Frontier will designate a nationally recognized bank,
trust company or stockholder services company reasonably acceptable
to Cowboy to act as exchange agent (the “ Exchange
Agent ”) for the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration, as provided in Section 3.1(a)(iii) and
Section 3.1(d) . Prior to the Effective Time, Frontier
will enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange
Agent, in a form reasonably acceptable to Cowboy (the “
Exchange Agent Agreement ”), setting forth the
procedures to be used in accomplishing the deliveries and other
actions contemplated by this Section 3.2 .

(b) Prior to the Effective Time,
Frontier shall deposit in trust, for the sole benefit of the
holders of shares of Cowboy Common Stock, with the Exchange Agent
certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Frontier
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 3.1(a)(iii) in exchange for the shares of
Cowboy Common Stock. After the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, Frontier shall provide or shall cause
to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such
 
15


shares of Frontier Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.2(e) . Frontier shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to
time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 3.1(d) . Such shares
of Frontier Common Stock, together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(d) and
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 3.2(e) , are referred to herein as the “
Exchange Fund ”. Frontier shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make delivery of, the
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

(c) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
two (2) Business Days thereafter), Frontier shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock
(i) a letter of transmittal (a “ Letter of
Transmittal ”) in customary form as prepared by Frontier
and reasonably acceptable to Cowboy (which shall specify, among
other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or the transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Cowboy
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) Upon surrender of a Certificate
or transfer of any Book-Entry Share representing shares of Cowboy
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal or receipt of
an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of transfer of a Book-Entry Share,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of whole shares of
Frontier Common Stock into which the Cowboy Common Stock
represented by the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall have been converted at the Effective Time, (ii) cash in
lieu of any fractional share interest of Frontier Common Stock in
accordance with Section 3.1(d) and (iii) certain
dividends and distributions in accordance with
Section 3.2(e) , if any, after the Exchange
Agent’s receipt of such Certificate or “agent’s
message” or other evidence, and the Certificate so
surrendered or the Book-Entry Share so transferred, as applicable,
shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. Until surrendered or transferred as
contemplated by this Section 3.2 , each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing shares of Cowboy Common Stock shall
be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article 3 . No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) No dividends or other
distributions declared or made prior to or after the Effective Time
with respect to Frontier Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any holder entitled by reason of
the Merger to receive shares of Frontier Common Stock until, and no
cash payment in lieu of a fractional share interest of Frontier
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 3.1(d) until, such holder shall have
surrendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Share of Cowboy Common
Stock pursuant to this Section 3.2 . Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock, such holder shall be
paid, in each case, without interest, (i) the amount of any
dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to
the shares of Frontier Common Stock represented by the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares of Cowboy Common Stock surrendered by such
holder and having a record date on or after the Effective Time and
a payment date prior to such surrender and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter,
the amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such shares of Frontier Common Stock and having a record
date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
a payment date on or after such surrender.

(f) In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Cowboy Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of Cowboy, it shall be a condition of
payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
transferred in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.2 shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Frontier that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Cowboy Common Stock
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Frontier upon demand, and any former holders of Cowboy
Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied
with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Frontier
for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

(h) None of Cowboy, Frontier, the
Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer,
director, agent or Affiliate of such entities, shall be liable to
any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration if the Exchange
Fund (or the appropriate portion thereof) has been delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of any shares of Cowboy Common Stock immediately prior to the time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Frontier free
and clear of any claims or interest of such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled
thereto.

withhold with respect to such payments under the Code or any other
provision of applicable Law. Any such amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article 3 .

may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K, Regulation S-X
or any successor or like form under the Exchange Act, which such
adjustments are not, in the aggregate, material to Frontier) and
(iv) fairly present, in all material respects (subject, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, for normal and recurring
year-end adjustments, none of which is material), the consolidated
financial position of Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as of their respective dates and the consolidated
statements of income and the consolidated cash flows of Frontier
and the Frontier Subsidiaries for the periods presented
therein.

(d) Frontier has designed and
maintained disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed by Frontier in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to Frontier’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, and to the Knowledge of Frontier, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Frontier’s management to material information required to be
included in Frontier’s periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act (if Frontier were required to file such reports).
Frontier and the Frontier Subsidiaries have designed and maintained
a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances (i) regarding the reliability
of
 
22


financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that
transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorizations, (iii) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements and to maintain asset accountability, (iv) that
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management’s general or specific authorization, (v) that
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences and (vi) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and
proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the
collection thereof on a current and timely basis. Frontier has
disclosed to Frontier’s auditors and audit committee (and
made summaries of such disclosures available to Cowboy)
(A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Frontier’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
to the Knowledge of Frontier, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in internal control over financial reporting. There are no internal
investigations by Frontier personnel or, to the Knowledge of
Frontier, any SEC or other governmental inquiries or investigations
to which Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary is a party pending or,
to the Knowledge of Frontier, threatened, in each case regarding
any accounting practices of Frontier.

relationship between or among Frontier and any Frontier Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of Frontier or
any Frontier Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or
any “off-balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Frontier, any Frontier Subsidiary or Frontier’s or Frontier
Subsidiary’s audited financial statements or other Historic
Frontier SEC Documents.

(f) None of Frontier or any Frontier
Subsidiary is required to be registered as an investment company

liability for the benefit of any current or former director,
officer, independent contractor, or employee of Frontier or any
Frontier Subsidiary or any spouse, dependent, or beneficiary

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Frontier
Material Adverse Effect. Each Frontier Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401 of
the Code has received a favorable IRS determination letter or is
maintained under a prototype or volume submitter document and
entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or advisory letter that it
is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (“
Frontier Qualified Benefit Plan ”) that has
 
27


not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of
Frontier, no circumstances exist and no events have occurred that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified

been operated and maintained in all material respects in
operational and documentary compliance with Section 409A of
the Code and all IRS guidance promulgated thereunder, to the extent
such section and such guidance have been applicable to such
Frontier Benefit Plan. No Frontier Benefit Plan, agreement,
Contract or other arrangement to which Frontier or, to the
Knowledge of Frontier, any Frontier Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of them is otherwise bound obligates Frontier to
compensate or reimburse any Person in respect of taxes pursuant to
Section 409A or 4999 of the Code. Neither Frontier nor any
Frontier Subsidiary (i) has been required to report to any
Governmental Authority any correction made or taxes due as a result
of a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code or
(ii) has any indemnity or gross-up obligation for any taxes,

(g) Neither Frontier nor any
Frontier Subsidiary of a Frontier Benefit Plan has engaged in a
nonexempt “prohibited transaction” (described in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that
would subject Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary to a material tax
on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 502(i) of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code.

(h) Frontier has never, and no ERISA
Affiliate of Frontier has ever, maintained or been obligated to
contribute to (i) an employee benefit plan that is subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971
of the Code, (ii) a “multiemployer plan” within
the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section 9001(a)(3) of
ERISA, (iii) a “multiple employer plan” within the
meaning of Code Section 413(c), or (iv) a multiple
employer welfare arrangement as defined in ERISA
Section 3(40). Frontier and its ERISA Affiliates have not
incurred, and there are no circumstances under which either could
reasonably be expected to incur, any liability under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(i) Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment,
acceleration, vesting or enhancement of any compensation or
benefits, including the payment of any “excess parachute
payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

(j) With respect to each Frontier
Benefit Plan that is not subject to U.S. Law (each, a “
Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan ”) established primarily
for the benefit of employees of Frontier or any Frontier Subsidiary
residing outside the United States and except as, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Frontier Material Adverse Effect, (i) each such Frontier
Foreign Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and
administered in compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, and
if intended to qualify for
 
28


special tax treatment, meets all requirements
for such treatment, (ii) all employer and employee
contributions to each Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan required by its
terms or by applicable Law have been made or, if applicable,
accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices
in the applicable jurisdiction applied to such matters, and
(iii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants
in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations
most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to
be less than such benefit obligations. To the Knowledge of
Frontier, each Frontier Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in all
material respects in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities.

Section 4.13 Employees and
Labor Matters.

proceeding presently pending or threatened in writing to be brought

Employees has engaged in any union organizing activity since
January 1, 2013. There are no material labor strikes,

any Frontier Subsidiary. Neither Frontier nor any Frontier
Subsidiary is required to provide notice to any work council or

such documents under the headings “Risk Factors” or
“Forward Looking Statements” or any other disclosures
contained or referenced therein to the extent they are similarly
non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature), and then only to the extent that the relevance of any

authority to own, lease and, to the extent applicable, operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Cowboy is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and

the properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing
necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or
in good standing that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse
Effect.

organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent
applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease and, to the extent
applicable, operate its properties and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Each Cowboy Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated
or leased by it or the nature of its business makes such

expected to have a Cowboy Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Section 5.1(c) of
the Cowboy Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of
the Cowboy Subsidiaries and their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or organization, as the case may be, the
jurisdictions in which Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries are

equity interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any
Person (other than in the Cowboy Subsidiaries and investments in
short-term investment securities).

(a) Cowboy has timely filed with, or
furnished (on a publicly available basis) to, the SEC all forms,
documents, statements, schedules and reports required to be filed
by Cowboy under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (together
with all certifications required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act) since January 1, 2013 (the forms, documents, statements
and reports filed with the SEC since January 1, 2013 and those
filed with the SEC since the date of this Agreement, if any,
including any amendments thereto, the “ Historic Cowboy
SEC Documents ”). As of their respective filing dates (or
the date of their most recent amendment, supplement or
modification, in each case, to the extent filed and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement), the Historic Cowboy
SEC Documents (i) complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of the Historic Cowboy SEC
Documents is, to the Knowledge of Cowboy, the subject of ongoing
SEC review and Cowboy does not have any outstanding and unresolved
comments from the SEC with respect to any Historic Cowboy SEC
Documents. None of the Historic Cowboy SEC Documents is the subject
of any confidential treatment request by Cowboy.

(b) Cowboy has made available to
Frontier complete and correct copies of all written correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and Cowboy, on the other hand,
since January 1, 2013 that is not publicly available on the
SEC EDGAR system. At all applicable times, Cowboy has complied in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c) The consolidated audited and
unaudited financial statements of Cowboy and the Cowboy
Subsidiaries included, or incorporated by reference, in the
Historic Cowboy SEC Documents, including the related notes and
schedules (as amended, supplemented or modified by later Historic
Cowboy SEC Documents, in each case, to the extent filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement),
(i) have been prepared from, are in accordance with, and
accurately reflect the books and records of Cowboy and the Cowboy
Subsidiaries in all material respects, (ii) complied as of
their respective dates in all material respects with the
then-applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case
of the unaudited financial statements, for normal and recurring
year-end adjustments and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, Form 8-K, Regulation S-X or any successor or like form under
the Exchange Act, which such adjustments are not, in the aggregate,
material to Cowboy) and (iv) fairly present, in all material
respects (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements,
for normal and recurring year-end adjustments, none of which is
material), the consolidated financial position of Cowboy and the
Cowboy Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of their respective dates
and the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated cash
flows of Cowboy and the Cowboy Subsidiaries for the periods
presented therein.

(d) Cowboy has designed and
maintained disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed by Cowboy
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is
accumulated and
 
40


communicated to Cowboy’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, and to the Knowledge of Cowboy, such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
Cowboy’s management to material information required to be
included in Cowboy’s periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act (if Cowboy were required to file such reports). Cowboy
and the Cowboy Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances (i) regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, (ii) that transactions are executed in
accordance with management’s general or specific
authorizations, (iii) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements and to
maintain asset accountability, (iv) that access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization, (v) that the recorded accountability
for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences and (vi) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Cowboy has disclosed to Cowboy’s
auditors and audit committee (and made summaries of such
disclosures available to Frontier) (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Cowboy’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, to the Knowledge of Cowboy,
whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal control over
financial reporting. There are no internal investigations by Cowboy
personnel or, to the Knowledge of Cowboy, any SEC other
governmental inquiries or investigations to which Cowboy or any
