Memories & Condolences






To the DiLuca family. I am so very sorry for your loss. You are all in my thoughts and prayers. I worked with Rob when he lived in Buffalo at Sea Captains and always made a point to visit with Millie when I would go by Buxton machine and tool. Please accept my deepest condolences.

I wanted to express my sincere sympathy for your family's loss.  I am happy and blessed to have had the opportunity to work with and get to know Rob during his time at Robert Half. He was always a willing resource to my Lexington team when they sought advise from his  recruiting experience.   He was such a genuine and caring individual who made a positive impact on all he encountered.  I had the chance to talk with Rob at our company's summer outing and enjoyed hearing the stories of his family in who he had such glowing pride for and love of.  All of you will be continue to be in my family's thoughts and prayers during this time of loss and healing.God bless,Lisa James

Word can't express how I feel about Rob. My cousin. He was not only a great cousin, but a friend and brother as well. He lived a good life, found a wonderful wife and had two awesome children. He will be missed by all. I Love you Rob. May God Bless you.
