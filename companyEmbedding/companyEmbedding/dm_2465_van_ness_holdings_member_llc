2465 Van Ness
San Francisco, CA

2465 Van Ness Avenue is ideally located several blocks from San Francisco’s northern waterfront at the intersection of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods, including the Marina, Cow Hollow, Russian Hill and Pacific Heights.  The project features 41 luxurious condominium residences, including one, two, and three bedroom homes.  Residences will showcase stunning City, Bay and Golden Gate Bridge views, and many homes will feature generous private outdoor areas.  The project will also include a large common roof deck, ideal for entertaining.
Retail will anchor the project along Union Street and Van Ness, activating the street level and providing a desirable amenity to residents and neighbors.  The project will transform what is currently a shuttered gas station.  The elegant, stately and contemporary design will incorporate timeless materials and adhere to the urban planning principles set forth in the Van Ness Area Plan that encourages reinforcement of topography and urban pattern, and defines and provides architectural variety.
