The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

EspresaEverything you wanted to know about EspresaADD A QUESTION How does it work?Espresa is a simple Web portal and mobile app that lets companies offer their employees onsite services at the click of a button. Employers select which services they want to offer from a pre-selected Espresa service catalog, employees go to the portal to request services, and pre-screened merchants provide the services.What kind of services do you offer?In a word, everything! Companies can offer massages, car wash, dry cleaning, food delivery, manicure, yoga, fitness programs... the list goes on.How much does it cost to become a vendor?There is no up-front cost or monthly maintenance fee for vendors. Espresa charges a commission from vendors who join the Espresa platform. We provide demand creation, customer support, scheduling, collection and efficient access for service providers to company premises. These benefits significantly outweigh our commissions, and we strive to improve the profitability of all our vendors.What if a company already offers onsite services?Espresa can help organizations streamline their existing programs by putting all transactions through a single, easy-to-use interface that lets users select vendors, schedule services, coordinate visits, and get employee feedback. We can help even the largest companies standardize their vendor relationships and streamline the service offering with a unified, one-stop-shop, user-friendly interface for employees.Why would I use Espresa?HR departments and administrative staff are often overwhelmed by clerical work, paper-based processes and employee-related support issues. Espresa saves time and money by streamlining an inefficient process, and in the process helps attract and retain employees and makes them much more productive. And because Espresa is fully automated, the time it takes to manage onsite benefits is significantly reduced. The bottom line is that WE take care of problems so YOU don`t have to.How do I access it?Espresa is built on a technology platform that allows employees, employers, and vendors to access information through the Web and mobile devices.What about security?One of our key differentiators is that our patent-pending platform allows employers to pre-screen all vendors to make sure that they not only do good work but that it is safe to have them on premises. We also provide a boarding pass to all vendors that allows employers to effortlessly gate entry and to know their whereabouts at all times. And our unique mapping function means that vendors know exactly where to go in an office or corporate campus. ADD A QUESTIONFill Out This FormNameEmailQuestionCANCELADD A QUESTIONThank you, your message has been sent.We appreciate you contacting Espresa and you will hear from us soon.Espresa TeamEspresaWhat Espresa SolvesEspresa is dedicated to making it easier for companies to offer their employees onsite services – ranging from dry cleaning to massages to car repairs. By offering these services, top employers are able to attract key talent, retain valuable employees and increase productivity. Managing these programs, however, requires time that busy HR departments simply don’t have, and offering these services often creates an increased workload and support burden for administrative professionals.Espresa is the SolutionOur Web and mobile platform allows employers to offer and manage onsite services, and lets companies of any size offer the same level of workplace services as larger corporations. Espresa’s intuitive interfacemakes every aspect of online service management easier – for employers, for employees, and for service providers.LEARN MORESend more infoCANCELSENDThank you, your message has been sent.We appreciate you contacting Espresa and you will hear from us soon.Espresa TeamEspresaLeadershipAlex ShubatCEO, Co-FounderAlex Shubat brings an extensive history in executive management and venture funding to his leadership of Espresa.
