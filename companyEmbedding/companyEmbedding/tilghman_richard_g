CEO of Crestar Financial Corp.


Richard G. Tilghman, chairman and
                         chief executive of Crestar Financial
                         Corp., recently sat down to talk with
                         Washington Post editors and reporters
                         about the region's economy, the
                         changing nature of banking and his
                         company, which is now the region's largest bank by market
                         share. With him were Peter F. Nostrand, president of
                         Crestar's Washington-area operations, and James M.
                         Wells, the company's president. An edited transcript of that conversation follows. Unless otherwise noted, Tilghman is giving the answers.




Q. Maybe I could ask you to start just by talking a little about where Crestar is, where you want to be, and obviously with particular reference to your plans for our region.

A. And if I may, please call me Richard, I don't come from a very formal culture and I don't think of myself as being very old, although my children do. So if that's okay with you, I would answer better to it. A few words about the bank to maybe set the stage. In 1985 when the interstate banking laws were passed we said then that we thought it would take a decade to sort out the marketplace that was then frequently referred to as the golden crescent, and you may remember in those days people were talking about the wonderful demography of Baltimore to Washington to Richmond all the way around to Hampton Roads, which formed sort of a crescent shape. And we set upon a path of being an important bank in that market; and as I will argue in a minute we have substantially accomplished that goal, but with more to do. The theory then, and it remains an accurate one for us today, is that demographically, Virginia is at the bottom of the economic North as opposed to at the top of the cultural South. That's not the sort of thing I normally say in Richmond, but the facts are that if you look at our population, you look at business and trade and where traffic goes and all that sort of stuff, there's an immense amount of flow back and forth in this region: You have the bonding of the Chesapeake Bay with Maryland, you have the transportation network, a lot of things sort of suggest to us that economically we needed to focus our attention to the North as opposed to the South, which is why you've seen us do no acquisitions essentially south of Virginia, while you're seen all of our interest go really to Virginia and north. And our goal is quite simple. This is an enormous marketplace. If you put it all together the Washington-Baltimore market is the fourth or fifth largest consumer market in America depending on how you keep the score, and you all know these numbers far better than we. 
In 1983, as we could see this interstate banking stuff coming we were a bank that really put, not a terrible amount of energy even into Northern Virginia - Northern Virginia being for people in Richmond sort of up there and they really didn't understand it very well. And we moved a fine man named Bill Harris up here in '84 to sort of figure out how to put us on the map, and it was really no more sophisticated a charge than that. We said Bill, go up there and figure out how to make us an important bank in this Washington area starting with Northern Virginia, because we couldn't come into the District. But to make us important. That process was substantially aided when interstate banking was passed and we bought the NS&T bank, which is now the physical headquarters which we operate. We bought a bank in Maryland almost simultaneously called the Bank of Bethesda, which put us into Montgomery County. And all of a sudden, boom, we were a three-state bank, so to speak, with three different names, and we were United Virginia in Virginia, NS&T in the District, Bank of Bethesda, so we changed our name to Crestar Bank. We launched a major effort recognizing that this is a very consumer-oriented marketplace. To enhance our service quality and to make us a bank that was as appealing to consumers as we were to businesses. In Virginia we had sort of a reputation of being the bank of business.

Q. How did you come up with the name Crestar?

A. We hired not one, but two, name-change consultants, who are a common commodity. We were in a hurry. They are people who will study this for one. Interestingly enough they both came up with the same name. It was on a short list for both name-change people. And it was that golden crescent idea. They just picked up on the golden crescent. We wanted seven letters instead of six because that was the era of Signet and Sovran and remember all those. So what they do is they come up with hundreds of names and we winnow them down and then you carry around cards in your pocket and then you pitch yourself off the edge of a cliff and pick one. A cynic would also suggest that maybe these days you all have the same computer programs. There's a finite number of words in the world. Interestingly enough in those days we operated in 10 states with our mortgage company and we were doing business in five or six in various ways. So you've got copyright laws. Trademark laws to deal with everywhere, which drives you to a made-up name so you don't have to spend days in litigation trying to get the right title to a name you want to use. So that's why you see Signet and Sovran and Crestar, all these manufactured names.

Q. And you can't mispronounce it. That's the other thing.

A. I'm confident that was not part of our scheme in those days. So with all of that becoming important here became really a crucial challenge for us. And led ultimately to a string of acquisitions in this market which really began in a big way with Perpetual Savings Bank which was purchased with the RTC and has been associated with a number of other smaller acquisitions. And most importantly, recently, with the affiliation with Citizens Bank of Laurel, Maryland, which, if you think about us from a market share standpoint, we were very strong in Virginia, kind of about right in the District of Columbia, and weakest in Maryland, and we really weren't in Prince George's County, which was a very fast-growing county in Maryland.

Q. Why didn't you go into Prince George's County before then?

A. We just couldn't get there. There was no 1-2-5 that was big enough to really solve the problem for us. The biggest, I guess, bank in that market was one called Suburban, which Sovran Bank bought back in the dark ages. And then it was just a lot of small community banks and one thing we really didn't want to do was start a de novo branch. Terribly expensive. Too many banks. We did some acquisitions, but really not much in Prince George's at all until Citizens came along. Citizens is strongest in Prince George's and next strongest in Montgomery and we were strongest in Montgomery and not strong along in Prince George's. Well you put the two of us together and it filled the gap or the hole in the doughnut for us. Filled the missing piece of the ring in the doughnut. And has been a spectacular thing from our point of view because it's a very fine bank. And brought us to our present position which is we are the 22nd, we're roughly 22 billion in size. Depending on who's keeping score we're somewhere around 34th or 35th largest bank in the U.S. We claim market share and leadership in the Washington metropolitan area. We're the largest bank holding company that's headquartered in Virginia. And we want to be a bank that focuses on the delivery of financial services on this marketplace, defining this marketplace as Virginia, Washington and it's environs, and Maryland. ...  And that's our goal and objective simply put. By 1999 to have most people recognize us as being the best bank around. The leading financial services institution is a strategic goal of ours. And that would entail having leadership and market share, leadership in satisfying our customers, financial leadership in terms of excellence and performance and in turn have that translate into excellent returns for our shareholders.

Q. Does that mean that you're not satisfied with the one-percentage-point advantage you have over NationsBank?

A. First place is first place. We would clearly like that margin to be wider. Market share is a complicated subject and it had to be coupled with profitability. You can't just have market share without profits and we have real goals in those regards. We want to be a market share leader but we also want to have the majority of the people, households we do business with, to be significant and profitable as well. And in the context of that, if we can achieve both of those goals we think we'll perform quite well. Market share is tough to grow but not impossible to grow. And we have a dual strategy of both getting more business and we're still very interested in merger and acquisitions and have been an aggressive acquirer of both thrifts and banks from an assets standpoint and we would continue that. We don't see that coming to an end. But we're also, if it doesn't make sense for the institution to combine with us, we're not pushy about it. We don't want to do something that's not in both party's interest because in the long run, happy customers are what you want to end up with. And if they're not happy about the way the two organizations came together then you're going to have an unsatisfactory experience.

Q. How do you compete when on rates you can be undercut by smaller banks or mortgage brokers or whatever, so given the marketplace and half a chance a consumer's going to take a lower rate. So how do you deal with that?

A. Complicated question. I'll come back to the question of market shares. There are hundreds of things that motivate consumers' buying decisions and it is a very, very competitive market as you all know just from living here with lots of choices ranging all the way from small banks to large financial institutions. The thing that we're aiming to do is to have the best bundle of convenient delivery alternatives for the purchase of financial services and competitive prices, but not necessarily leading edge. The individual who is interested in getting absolutely the best rate or absolutely the lowest rate or absolutely the highest deposit rate will always be able to find someone in the marketplace who's going to be offering a better rate than we are. But what we're intending to do is to give the individual who's interested in a decent rate, a good rate, an outstanding combination of convenient delivery alternatives ranging all the way from being able to bank by telephone to being able to do banking through traditional banks to being able to do banking through all kinds of alternative electronic delivery mechanisms. So we can get with Crestar on your personal computer. You can get with Crestar by telephone. You can get with Crestar in a bank. Physically you can use our ATMs, you can use our interactive marketing terminals. And our theory quite simply is that for most people, a fair price and convenience is going to be a powerful motivator. Now, there will be plenty of people for whom other things will be powerful motivators, but we don't need to get 100 percent of the market, we just want to get more than our fair share. There's no reason to believe that banks of our size cannot offer financial instruments that are competitive in price with large institutions.  There's no reason we can't. From a cost structure standpoint where the economies and scale available in institutions our size are almost the economies available in extremely large institutions. In some areas we would argue that those economies that they may have are offset by bureaucratic differences. We presumably are going to be closer to the customer and nimbler in our response. 
We also have sort of a different organizational strategy than a lot of institutions as Peter Nostrand, who is to my left here, is the president of our banking operations in the Greater Washington region --  and I would dare say that most of you have absolutely no clue as to who I was before we came here. And that's a strategy that's by design. We operate in a lot of markets where our theory of life is that people want to conduct banking with local operations and yet we're not local. I mean it's very obvious, we've only got one headquarters. So our answer to that is we have a string of regional headquarters where we have a regional president to whom reports both retail banking and commercial banking and the credit decisions that are made in that marketplace, charitable contributions, no one need ever come to Richmond, Virginia, to raise money in the Washington metropolitan area, all they need to do is go see Peter. 
Conversely, no one's going to be successful, if their idea doesn't work for Peter then it doesn't work for Crestar. The advantage of this, that our experience is, that people in any given community like to think that their banking services are being provided in that community. We do, like everybody else, we have call centers, we have as much efficient processing as we could possibly get our hands on in the back office but we want to be sure that for consumers and businesses the local people that they can turn to who understand the market, who believe in the marketplace, and who can participate in making that decision. And we think that's a strategy that will, over a long period of time, separate us out from the people who are providing global banking services at the other end of the telephone. If you want to call us up at 2:30 in the morning, well you can do that. But, on the other hand, if you walk down the street and see somebody in a branch you can do that, too. And if you want to talk to the president of the bank you can get to Peter Nostrand. You don't have to go to somebody who works in Virginia.

Q. Perhaps we could put Peter on the spot and ask him about, what do you see as the key strengths and weaknesses in the District, suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia? And particularly whether you feel any more encouraged about the District's economy?

A. PETER NOSTRAND: Turn to the local economy --  I think 'Washington Initiative' is the new phrase now -- and they go out and they market Washington and they say 'right place, right time.' One could argue, I think, that's the way the Washington region, our region, has some attributes that are fairly unique in the United States. This is a Washington marketplace and I think it grew to be a reflection.
If you look at it, and I look at it just from a commercial perspective, it has to do with employment, and revenues and dollars, the market [is unique]. First of all, health care insurance  it is growing, as we all know that is one of the fastest growing - the Greater Washington has some 74 hospitals of a national stature and a growing assisted-living-care industry in this region and if you look at the demography you understand why it really should do well.
Secondly, it's known and I've seen a lot of reports written about the average education here and the household income and they're both very, very high, but what is not recognized too often is that there's a big education business in the Greater Washington region. There are some 21 nationally recognized universities, eight colleges, my daughter's going to be going to one this fall, so this is a big business for education.
Third, and I probably should have started with the federal government, the federal presence is obviously one that leads to a great deal of stability in income ... and despite the cutbacks the federal presence is a huge presence here. 
The not-for-profit industry is a big, big business in the Greater Washington region and certainly one of the big attractions for us at Crestar the not-for-profit industry I think employs, I think it ranks No. 3 in the number of people it employs. And with the not for profits you've got trade associations that are very, very big here in the District of Columbia. I think 32 percent of all the trade associations are here in the Greater Washington region. You've got 76 multinational unions that are headquartered here, that's over 40 percent of the unions. 
So from an employment perspective the not for profits are a great big deal in the District. 
Fifth, you've got the international side. There are four hundred or so U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies here in this region and that's another fast growing segment. 
Sixth you've got tourism, which is the third largest employer in the region. 
And the technology center. The Greater Washington Board of Trade put a study out recently that shows that there are 2,331 technology firms in the region. All the big names are here. One of the most interesting aspects of that is some 80 percent of these high tech firms here employ less than 100 people, that's a tremendous amount of energy and vitality and creativity in the marketplace, which is a good sign for this region. 
So in answer to your question about the economy in the Greater Washington region, I think the first thing you have to say it has -- unique I think in cities in this country -- is the fact that technology and not for profit and the federal government and tourism, these are things that increase and decrease, and with the economy that there are things that are very stable things. 
I think when you talk about what the economy is like today, you have to separate it into Northern Virginia, suburban Maryland and the District. The figures I've seen recently suggest that Northern Virginia is doing better than the U.S. as a whole, whereas suburban Maryland is about on par and the District unfortunately has, some say, has been in a recession since 1992 in large measure because of the cutbacks in the federal government. We used to see in the 1970s and 1980s, when I first came up here in the 1980s, you'd see job growth and 70,000 jobs here. Now it's down to about 35,000 jobs. And the whole economy with just that slower pace of growth.
One of the interesting things that one of our economists at the bank mentioned to me yesterday that I think would he of interest to you all, it certainly is to us, is that with this computer 2000, that in fact the federal government has got the same issue that a lot of the private sector does and we've read statistics about what it would cost to fix that. And I think that OMB said it would cost $2.6 billion for the federal government to bring all of the special hardware and computers to bring it up to compliance with the year 2000 issues.
The private industry people have used a number as high as $60 billion, while there seems to be emerging consensus around a $30 billion dollar number. 
If you translate that back into jobs for this region, for this economy, it could mean that the federal government's share of that $30 billion is proportionately the same as it has been in the past which means that roughly $12 billion are spent here, you could see as many as 35,000 new jobs created in 1998 and 1999 to help address this 2009 requirement. That could lead people to sort of think that the economic issues and the employment issues in the District and the region would be solved. So you have to be careful. 

Q. A lot of retired ones coming out. 
When you look kind of more closely at the kind of detail that you see about the projects and the mortgages, do you see the District's economy going this way or this way? What's the long term? 

A. The encouraging thing about the District is that there are so many parties now that should be privy to the discussion are parties to the discussion. The White House is a party to it, the Congress is at the table, the local politicians are there, local business groups are there. It's the first time in my memory that you have the right people at the table. And because of that I don't see how, I can see how things would have to get better from here. 

Q. A business measure that's what I'm groping for here. Are things looking up, down or sideways?

A. We look at the market in so many different ways. Talking about the Greater Washington Region is like talking about 'My fellow Americans,' in that respect there is no really my fellow Americans, nor is there a GWR person. People who work in the District may live outside the District, and people who live in the District may work in Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. It really depends on how you cut it. If you're talking about the District government per se. I think in the long term we are still big believers in this marketplace. ... I think there will be some assistance in terms of the Congress and the White House. I think their doors are reasonably open on that, and it could have a very good impact on the District.

Q. Peter, you're not seeing any fundamental difference are you in the way deposits are growing in District branches versus ...

A. NOSTRAND: No, not at all. 

Q. How deposits might be growing in the District versus how they grow in Maryland or ...
A. NOSTRAND: How is it possible to tell to the point, for example, I bank on New York Avenue in the District, I live in Alexandria. My deposits are likely to be counted as part of the District's versus Northern Virginia. And there's such fluidity in the region now that it's very hard to distinguish one area from another.
Q. Part of what I think we're curious about is whether the interdependence, you know, this golden crescent concept that launches you on your path of growth, saw Northern Virginia tied to the District, tied to Maryland. Whether you're seeing communications, as we are, that that may not be holding up. That in fact, Northern Virginia is you know in a really extraordinary cycle now of job growth, new business grow, ancillary supporting business and, at the same time, the District and Maryland are basically standing still and that Northern Virginia is accelerating into some new space. And I guess I'm wondering, does that require some alterations in your strategic plan. Is there going to be less interdependence in this region than you might once have thought because of the surprisingly vast growth of Northern Virginia. And what do you do about that as a business, you're profiting from that.

A. NOSTRAND: Well regardless of where the growth is we want to be part of it and if the growth is in Northern Virginia we certainly want to be a part of that growth. And a lot of the growth in Northern Virginia is in the technology sector, you see the growth in Northern Virginia. And an attempt by Northern Virginia to push itself as the next Silicon Valley in fact and it could well be if you have this World Congress and Information Technology that Northern Virginia is assuming that role.
But certainly the economic health of the entire region at large, which we have a key interest in, you know, there are certain interregional issues, which you really can't escape, and transportation is certainly a big one. Water and sewage treatment is a big one. Prisons. And there are lots of very fundamental societal regional issues which require cooperation. 

Q. Richard, let me ask you, is there time to do some fine tuning in the strategic sense?

A. Well from our standpoint, we have significant market share in Northern Virginia and I guess the thing I would grapple for is to draw a distinction between the business opportunities that may be presenting themselves and the consumer banking opportunities because what we see is that people tend to move around the Washington Metropolitan area relatively freely and an individual might live in Loudoun County, work downtown in the District and shop in Maryland on the weekend. And, as a strategy for consumers, we want to be essentially well located in all of those markets so an individual can bank where they work ,where they shop, where they live. 
From a business development standpoint, when Peter first moved up here he did some similar work that identified, I think, some 24 different clusters Peter if my memory serves, where there are nodes or concentrations of business opportunities across all the geographies and you really attack those kinds of business problems quite differently. Commercial lending officers are frequently not resident in a branch but rather are in office buildings or more likely even still in an automobile en route to call on a customer at their place of doing business. And most typically they'll be specialized by some sort of skill. The not for profit, specialized in dealing with not for profits or government contractors is a specialization group for us or technology or whatever the market concentration might be.
So if you will, if it's beginning to boom in high tech in Northern Virginia, then it's not difficult for us to ship resources to that market and you know Virginia is quite strong right now, a combination I think of felicitous public policy and the work done by predecessor organizations to build a favorable business environment for high technology. And the guys who started the Internet back in well I guess it was the 1960s, happened to be in Northern Virginia and we probably all owe them a debt of gratitude for starting that seminal high tech business. And defense clearly led to a lot of this as well.

Q. I'm happy to hear you say that, explain that to some of my colleagues. 

A. Yeah, I mean I think, it's like somebody said to me one time, the way to have a great franchise is to have had a great franchise. Well you know I think Virginia is a state that for whatever lucky reasons had the infrastructure begin to be built there years and years ago. My sense is Maryland, and I know Maryland less well so this may be unfair, but my sense is that Maryland went more in the direction of medicine, with the National Institute of Health and Johns Hopkins. More heavy manufacturing and biotechnology.

Q. And weapons systems.

A. And as a result, as those sort of technologies have ebbed and flowed from contributing to the growth engine, you see a difference in the way Virginia's performing versus Maryland. But there was a time when the reverse was probably true, almost inevitably, and our optimism was very clear: This is a marketplace that's got the nation's capital as the centerpiece. I mean there don't happen to be other markets in the United States that can lay that claim and there's always going to be, I think, an extraordinary critical mass of very, very talented people coupled with government here, coupled with arguably a wonderful place for facilities here, the quaity of life, despite all the social problems. I'm tremendously optimistic.

Q. The strong conclusion that the river's getting wider and wider and Northern Virginia's breaking away from the Washington Metropolitan area and the person who lives in Loudoun County and works in the District of Columbia and shops in Maryland never gets into Maryland, never gets in the District of Columbia. In fact if that person gets that far in and shops at Fair Oaks.  And I wonder if some of that is in your .... And I don't know whether this is true or not but you can see the economy going in different directions.

A. Well these 24 places Peter noticed whenever it was, 12 or 15 years ago, there are now probably 36 of them. Pick Reston or Columbia or wherever you used to pick. People live and work in the same place if they can do that. So that is clearly the case. However, the dynamic of the whole area absolutely matters, I mean we see it in Virginia all the time. If you look at the older cities and you talk about the donuts and the holes and all those sorts of things and they are inextricably intertwined in our opinion and you have to worry about the whole area. At the same time, you focus on these nodes and that's sort of the way we think about it whether it's Baltimore or Richmond or Roanoke or wherever it is. 
We see exactly that in Richmond. Twenty years ago the commuting pattern in Richmond, which we've done some studies on, was almost entirely in and out. It was all basically a matter I guess it would be west to east in the morning and then east to west in the evening and now it's multidirectional. It's north to south, south to north, west to east, people going in all kinds of different directions but nonetheless it reinforces in a way almost the need to be omnipresent from a banking facility and from a service standpoint. 
The other point I want to make here and it's sort of crucial to this business of market share, is that we are very much an industry that is ever segmenting people and businesses by estimations of what it is they need and want to buy and how they need and want to buy it. So increasingly you don't see us or other banks looking at a market like Greater Washington in a monolithic way. But rather trying to understand the thousands of little submarkets that make up this big market so that we can have products and services that will work for ever smaller clusters and are ever more precisely designed and delivered. But we can do this because, increasingly, we have the data processing chip that only Peter really understands how we make money, where we make money, and couple that with marketing tools that marry that up with demography, which is not necessarily a good predictor of banking success. And with, if you will, lifestyle buying patterns so that we are not trying to sell home mortgages to people who are 65 years old because we're blanketing a given market with mortgages today, but rather we're really zeroing in based on values and on behavioral characteristics that would lead us to believe that that party might be interested in a mortgage.
So you know we can, if you will in one way, afford to look at a given marketplace as a unit and yet in another way the obligation is almost immediately that we begin to define that unit in ever and ever smaller chunks. So that we're really giving people what they want and customer knowledge data bases are I guess a common point of conversation in lots of industries today and they're made possible by the fact that that storage has become inexpensive enough to keep enormous files. 

Q. That's an interesting topic. Would you ever let us sit with you and see how that ends up working as a business tool?

A. Sure. I'm not sure we'd be willing to do it tomorrow in all seriousness. And the reason I'm reticent about the time and speed is because the progress that we and everybody else has made in this sort of stuff is still, we're still learning how to use these systems, but sure.

Q. Do you agree with the way NationsBank has taken, they've been taking a lot of heat about their new customer service and ranking people by profitability and delivering services based on that? And that's part of this whole data mining.

A.Well it is and it isn't. It is an answer, it is one of a huge possible universe of answers to data mining. It surely is a manifestation of the sort of things that people do with data mining. But it's not necessarily an approach that you know would be appropriate for us or any other financial institution. What it is indicative of is that we're all beginning to use information and come up with individualized responses to what that information says. When you think about it, 15 years ago, we were a regulated industry selling standard products to standard people in a standard way. I mean we were one size fit all and if it didn't work for you, tough darts. But now we're really beginning to customize products for businesses and consumers in very, very individualized ways.

Richard G. Tilghman

Former Vice Chairman and Director of SunTrust Banks

After graduating from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in Foreign Affairs and serving in the U.S. Army as a lieutenant, Mr. Tilghman enjoyed a 34-year banking career, including service as Vice Chairman and Director of Suntrust Banks, as well as the former Chairman and CEO of Crestar Financial Corporation, a bank holding company for fifteen years. His career provided him with experience and expertise in the areas of leadership, corporate strategy and development, finance, banking, accounting and risk management. Mr. Tilghman’s experience overseeing a business and technology transformation for a series of banks acquired through acquisitions is very important to Sysco as we undertake our ERP/Business Transformation Project to streamline our operations using a common technology platform. Mr. Tilghman also gained high tech and regional marketing experience that has been valuable to Sysco as we have redefined oversight of our operating companies by marketing region and focus on the use of e-Commerce technologies to service Sysco customers more efficiently. Mr. Tilghman’s experience also includes approximately 20 years of service on the Board of Directors of Chesapeake Corporation, which was then a leading supplier of cartons, labels, leaflets, and specialty plastic packaging, with manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe and the U.S. at that time.
