AEW Capital Management deploys Advent portfolio management software
18 December 2007  |  1829 views  |  0
Source: Advent Software
Advent Software, Inc. (NasdaqGS:ADVS), the leading provider of software and solutions for the global investment management industry, today announced that AEW Capital Management, L.P. (AEW) has implemented Advent Portfolio Exchange (APX), Advent's comprehensive, integrated portfolio management solution.

	Boston-based AEW provides real estate investment management services worldwide, and with its affiliates, manages more than $41 billion in real estate assets and securities.AEW chose APX because of the product's SQL architecture, the comprehensive audit capabilities and the ability to control user access.Commenting on the efficiency gains achieved with APX, Rich Moreschi, Director of Securities Operations at AEW Capital Management, observed, "After using APX for eight months, I can see that it has allowed us to become much more efficient, enabling us to take on new business and new clients. Managers now have easier access to portfolio information, while controllers are better able to trace changes to data and the IT group has more flexibility in limiting system access. With its highly scalable architecture, APX is the right system to support our growth strategy."AEW's Securities Group continues to rely on Moxy, Advent's industry leading trade order management system. Added Moreschi, "It's a seamless and efficient integration between APX and Moxy. Advent's integrated offering meets all of our portfolio and trade order management needs, and provides us with an efficient and scalable front- to back-office platform.""AEW has been a great business partner to Advent as we've evolved our suite, and we're very pleased that they are reaping the benefits of using APX to support their global operations," said Susan Lundquist, Vice President, Product Marketing at Advent. "We're grateful for AEW's continued confidence in Advent's innovative suite of mission-critical solutions that free our customers to focus on their core activities while providing even greater service directly to their clients."
