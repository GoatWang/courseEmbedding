Educational Development Corp.: Is It An MLM Or A Direct Seller? Part 1 - Educational Development Corporation (NASDAQ:EDUC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Educational Development Corp.: Is It An MLM Or A Direct Seller? Part 1Jun.12.17 | About: Educational Development (EDUC) Gregory Stefflre Value, registered investment advisor, long-term horizon, special situationsSummaryEDUC's rapid growth may not be all that it appears.EDUC is growing because of consultants, but consultants aren't staying.Cash flows have become a problem for EDUC, and we might know why. Educational Development Corp. (NASDAQ:EDUC) is a small company that recently reported large year-over-year revenue growth. The company is reporting "record" net revenues. For example, on May 30, it announced a 68% growth in revenue year over year. This type of growth can be extremely positive. However, in the case of EDUC, the growth in sales is not as great as one might suspect. I plan on describing the issues in a two-part series. This first article will look at the financials of the business and how they are changing over time, and the second article will examine more qualitative issues. EDUC is growing at unsustainable levels, and it is impacting the financial performance of the company. A sleepy, stable, and profitable business is being changed into a high growth, low profitability, and potentially volatile business. Recently, the longtime CEO has become more aggressive in promoting the business and has touted somewhat irrelevant metrics of success. This all comes at a detriment to the cash flows and financial viability of the company. EDUC is a distributor and publisher of children's books. It distributes books produced by Usborne Publishing of the U.K. EDUC also publishes a line of books under the Kane Miller nameplate. In the most recent 10-K found online, EDUC reports that in FY 2017, 92% of its revenues are from Home Business Division/UBAM ("UBAM") division, and the publishing division contributed the other 8%. UBAM is described as follows, "This division distributes books nationwide through independent consultants, who hold book showings in individual homes, through social media, book fairs with school and public libraries and internet sales." These consultants can earn commission on the sales of individuals they bring into the EDUC mix. This is known as multi-level marketing or MLM. The publishing unit, by contrast, markets books to large and small book stores, as well as other specialty stores. Key Question: Is EDUC an MLM or a direct sales retailer disguised as an MLM? EDUC has shifted over time from a traditional distributor of books to an MLM. This isn't inherently a bad thing because the book industry has been decimated by the rise of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). With the closing of hundreds of book stores, this shift may be prudent. But MLMs have potential issues by virtue of how they are structured that should give conservative investors some pause. For the most recent year ending Feb. 28, 2017, EDUC reported net revenues of $106 million. The net revenue number presented in the financials as follows: Gross Sales $124,958,900 (-) (Discounts & Allowances) (29,486,300) (+) Transportation Revenues 11,155,500 Net Sales $106,628,100 If an investor makes a chart looking at the historical gross sales vs. the historical net sales, it would look like the following. 

 You can see that from about 2004 to 2015, the company averaged around $40 million in net sales and $26 million in net sales. There was basically no growth for an entire 11-year period. Then, in 2016, net sales jumped to $60 million, and in 2017, net sales jumped to $100 million. In the most recent 8-K, CEO Randall White was quoted as saying the following, "Fiscal year 2017 is the second straight year of amazing revenue growth. We exceeded the $100M Annual Sales hurdle for the first time in the Company's history and achieved record earnings per share. This success could not have occurred without the incredible effort of our UBAM Sales Consultants and the hard work of our office and warehouse employees." Key Question 2: Is EDUC really a $100 million dollar company? My research may indicate that's misleading Whenever I study a new business, I try to peel back the layers to determine the financials of the core "operating" business. In the case of EDUC, I decided to adjust these sales numbers. My goal is to try and determine how much money is being generated from the sale of books. Here is what my 2016 adjusted numbers look like. 

 I will walk you through the rationale behind each adjustment. I start with the same gross number and the same discounts & allowances numbers. Shipping costs should be taken out to determine net revenues The first change you will see is that I am adding back $16 million to the transportation revenues. Why? $16 million represents the costs to ship books to customers. I understand that it may be weird for some to remove an "expense" from a revenue number, but there is a reason. Some companies make money on shipping and handling charges which may be attractive business model separate from the selling of products. But in the case of EDUC, the shipping costs are more than the revenue it is charging for shipping the products. Thus, in essence, the gross revenue number is subsidizing the cost of shipping, and thus, a portion of the sales numbers is not related to the selling of books. Here is a simple example of what I mean. Let's say I sell an item for $100 with free shipping vs. selling an item for $95.00 + $5.00 shipping. My gross revenues would be the same in either case. But in the $100 revenue figure lies some portion of that revenue necessary for shipping the item. But let's say that it cost me $8.00 to ship the item to the person. Then, my $5.00 shipping revenue does not cover the cost. In that instance, the company is subsidizing the extra $3.00 in sales. In scenario one, I am saying that we should show $100 - $8.00 = $92.00. The price we realized for the item is $92.00. Same with scenario 2 ($95.00 + $5.00 - $8.00 = $92.00). Under the approach by EDUC, it would show the following: $95.00 + $5.00 or $100.00 in net revenues, or $95.00 in product sales and $5 in shipping revenues. And, the $8.00 shipping charges show up as an expense further down the line. Commissions also should be removed to determine "Product Sales" The benefit of an MLM structure is that you can pay less in traditional overhead, marketing & advertising expenses because you have a sales force that is working for you, but you do not have the burden of those expenses. You can also pay less in advertising costs. However, the expenses show up as commissions or rebates to the consultants who work for you. In MLMs, commissions are often a form of a discount to the stated retail price. We can see this issue in the financials. The percentage of net revenue that EDUC is spending on advertising is going down. (Note: advertising is stated in EDUC's selling and operating line item.) 

 Thus, these commissions are in essence a form of discounts that again are embedded in the sales figures. Once we remove these two hidden "costs" that are in the revenue number, we can see that the company is selling significantly less "product" than what may appear at first blush. If I recreate the first chart provided above, you can see the following. 

 As you might expect, there is no change to the gross revenue numbers, but there is a dramatic change to the net sales numbers. My approach is suggesting that the company actually sold only $56 million in product versus $109 million. To be 100% clear, I am not in any way saying that EDUC management is wrong for reporting the numbers the way it has. What I am saying is that for investors and eventually for management, laying out or thinking about the sales in this regard gets closer to the real economics of the business. Also, you could have done this several different ways. For me, I want to know what the company is doing in product sales. I am suggesting that the "commissions" being paid to the consultants is a discount or rebate that should be accounted for in the top line. Also, I am suggesting that when a company charges lower shipping than what it costs to ship the item, then the revenue number should account for this fact. The changes I am making do not change any of the final, net, numbers. The chart below provides you a condensed income statement for 2017. On the left is the stated income statement, and the right shows how my adjustments impact the income statement. 

 But this approach can change how you think about the business and the growth in other areas. The growth in sales is dramatically slower than what may appear. Under the traditional method presented by EDUC, the sales from 2013 to 2017 would have grown by a little over 300%. Under my method, the real product sales only grew at little over 200%. It is paying more to ship the items and paying higher commissions which the net sales numbers do not reveal. We can also use this data to see what the historical trends have been. If I take the new "Adj. revenue" number as a percentage of gross sales, we see that the company is capturing less and less of the reported gross revenue number. Under my approach, what you are seeing is that the percentage of product sales related to the stated gross number is going down. The absolute numbers are growing. In 2013, the product sales were 46% of the stated gross number, and in the fiscal year ending 2017, they were 44%. 

 Note: I am showing the additional hidden shipping cost, because I am not adding back the transportation revenue. Gross margin structure is completely different under this approach. The following chart shows how EDUC thinks about the business. In 2017, the gross margin as a percentage of net revenues would be 73.2%, and that has been improving over the past several years. 

 If we use the adjusted numbers, here is what we get. 

 You can see the company's actual gross margin on products is a lot lower than what might appear. Also, we can see that the growth in cost of goods sold is about half of what the sales might have indicated. While EDUC is growing at over 300%, its supplier's sales are only growing at 170%. As you sell more, you can get bigger discounts from suppliers which would account for some of the difference but not all. EDUC is holding onto less and less consultants EDUC defines "current active consultants" as someone who has sales within the last six months. P. 8. Management likes to explain that the growth in sales is coming from the growth in the number of consultants. And, the absolute numbers show this transition. 

 In the chart above, you can see that the number of new consultants and active consultants has grown dramatically. But what isn't so clear from the chart is how many old consultants are sticking around. So, I created an addition to the chart and provide you with a copy below. In this chart, I have added an old consultants line, which is the number of active consultants minus the number of new consultants. I then took this result and set as a percentage of active consultants. 

 So, what is happening? We can see that the number of old consultants as a percentage of active consultants has dropped to 5%. In the past, the number has ranged from 20% to 30%. EDUC is a direct seller of books This suggests that EDUC is shifting its business model to a direct seller of products rather than a traditional MLM. Why? The consultants who sign up are not really interested in sticking around to sell the books. They are interested in purchasing the books at a discount and then moving on. Here is a screenshot of the pitch to join Usborne Books as consultant. 

 From the same page, you can find the new consultant kit information. I have copied the screenshot below. 

 EDUC offers you two different kits for becoming a consultant. The first one costs $75.00. And, the second one costs $125.00. Both these packages include free shipping. 



 If you purchase the $75.00 kit, you are getting a total of 10 books (two featured and eight other books for a value of $100.00). If you purchase the $125.00, you are getting three featured books and 17 other books. And no, you do not get to pick the books that you think are most relevant for your "audience." A Look at the Best Sellers As most MLMs do, the join page talks a lot about financial security and becoming a business owner, while the facts may suggest otherwise. Because we don't know which books you will get with your new consultant kit. There is not an easy way to check these claims, but here is my own attempt. I went to the Shop portion of the EDUC website found here. I looked at the best sellers which show the 50 best sellers. Next, I took those item numbers and prices and put them in EXCEL. I then went ahead and ordered that table by the most expensive books. 

 Remember, if you spent $75.00, you were entitled to a total of 10 books, and if you spent $125.00, you are entitled a total 20. This chart is assuming that EDUC gives you the most expensive books and best sellers as part of your kit. Then, the retail value of the books is $113.90 for the $75 kit and $213.80 for the $125.00 kit. If a person sold all their books, they would make the difference of $38.90 and $88.80. This does not include any expenses for running your "business." Inventory Issues: The final area of concern is in regard to inventory. Non-current inventory is growing slower than what one might expect Here is how EDUC reports non-current inventory. 10-K 2017 p. 14 "Certain inventory is maintained in a non-current classification. Management continually estimates and calculates the amount of non-current inventory. Non-current inventory arises due to occasional purchases of titles in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle, due to minimum order requirements of our suppliers. Non-current inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title." EDUC reports the inventory at the gross amount and then shows a line item for an Inventory Valuation Allowance. They do this for both current and non-current inventory. When I input the data into excel, here is what I got. 

 What you can see is that the value of net non-current inventory is going down on an absolute basis and as % of total inventory. This could be correct, but it just raises some concerns. If you combine the net current inventory and the net non-current inventory, then this would be the total inventory on the balance sheet. I went further and provide how much the non-current inventory is as a percentage of the total net inventory. That percentage has been going down dramatically. The decrease could be a result of the faster sales or the growth in sales, i.e., EDUC is clearing stuff, and the inventory is not sitting on the shelves for as long. But the comment provided above in regards to buying inventory that would not be sold in a normal business cycle in order to meet minimums would seem to suggest otherwise. The concern is that management may be buying too much inventory to get minimums to show increase in gross margins and then not marking that inventory down to non-current. Remember our blind box, consultant kit for $75.00 to $125.00. Well, what if a title is getting old on the shelves such that it would need to be reported as non-current. Management could plop one of those titles into the box and then claim that is still current inventory. Summary: In this article, my goal was to show you different ways to check the status of the underlying core business. There may be good business reasons for why these things are happening, but investors should try to answer these questions for themselves. In the next article, I plan to address how these financial issues are possibly impacting the company and point out some other areas concerns that are more qualitative in nature. I have no financial interest in this company, long or short. Nor do I have any derivative investment long or short. Any errors in the article are unintentional.

Educational Development Corp., Part 2: Corporate Governance - Educational Development Corporation (NASDAQ:EDUC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Educational Development Corp., Part 2: Corporate GovernanceJun.12.17 | About: Educational Development (EDUC) Gregory Stefflre Value, registered investment advisor, long-term horizon, special situationsSummaryCorporate governance seems to be lacking at EDUC.Is EDUC going to have to issue equity?The growth is coming at a cost to the shareholders. This is part 2 of my series on Educational Development Corporation (NASDAQ: EDUC). The last article focused on walking readers through some of the financial issues with the rapid growth of the company. This article will focus on more qualitative issues. The primary focus of this article is on possible corporate governance issues. Doing investment research is a lot liking doing a puzzle. Except you do not have the benefit of having a cover with a picture to guide you along. You sit and try picking up different pieces to see if they fit together. In the case of EDUC, I am laying out a bunch of different pieces that don't seem to fit. While any one issue raised by itself may not be that important, as the list gets longer and longer it raises some questions. No More Dividend. The first issue is the fact that EDUC has suspended their dividend in its entirety. On Feb. 16, 2016, EDUC filed an 8-K announcing the dividend suspension. Here is what they had to say, The Company has experienced extraordinary growth the past two years. Net revenues in Fiscal Year 2015 were $33 million, Fiscal Year 2016 $64 million, and Fiscal Year ending February 2017 projected to reach $109 million. This growth has required the Company to invest in additional inventory, warehouse fulfillment equipment and software upgrades. Management believes it is in the best interest of the shareholders to suspend the dividend and focus all resources and cash requirements toward financing future growth." Up until this point, EDUC paid a dividend since 1998. I do not have a problem with a company cutting a dividend if it is because they are investing in profitable growth. But as my article suggests, the real reason the company is cutting the dividend is because the business is becoming less and less profitable. First CFO, and Management Changes. I understand that small companies are not always run the same as larger companies, but EDUC just hired their first official CFO. Dan O'Keefe was appointed CFO effective March 06, 2017. He took over for Marilyn Pinney whose title was Controller (principal financial officer) and corporate secretary who had resigned March 06, 2017. What? Marilyn resigned?? Who knew? While the 8-K was filed with the SEC on 3/14/2017, this 8-K lists the management changes described above. But what else is interesting is the fact that the company also attached a press release to this 8-K. When you read the press release which was issued on March 13, 2017, you can read about all the growth the company has experienced. The company announced that the net revenues of $106 million. But the press release makes no mention of the management changes that took place over a week earlier. So apparently you have to go to the SEC website to find out this news. How about the company's own website? I went to the following website address for EDUC investors. 

 At this link you can see that the company hasn't even updated their own website. The last press releases were prior during 2009. Also, financial websites like Yahoo Finance or Seeking Alpha only pull press releases and not usually the 8-Ks. Here is a snapshot from Seeking Alpha, showing EDUC's press releases: 

 Who is Craig White? Because of the above issues, I wanted to see how long Ms. Pinney had been the controller and corporate secretary (since 2007). Also, her age (52). I was able to see this in the most recent proxy statement. But what struck me as odd was the executive compensation chart. 

 Ms. Pinney's compensation wasn't listed on the executive compensation chart. This just struck me as odd because you often see closer to five people on these types of lists. But a smaller company could be different. If you read the last line of the picture provided above, you see that Ms. Pinney's compensation was below $100,000 and thus, not reported. What you will also see is Craig White's name on this form. Who is Craig White? Randall White is the President/Chairman/Treasurer of EDUC. One might assume that he is the son of Randall White, but the filings do not disclose this information. I had to go all the way back to annual report in 2006 to find out that Craig was, in fact, Ron's son. You see EDUC used to make the following chart for investors. 

 Most companies disclose this type of relationship to explain any appearance of potential conflicts of issue. Also, you should note that Craig joined the company right after college and then was promoted to Head of Information Systems in a little over a year. 

 However, this start date seems to be in question. The chart above is from the most recent Proxy Statement filed 6/20/2016. It says he has been in that role since 1994. And the previous chart said he was appointed Manager in July 1995. Also, this section should raise the issue of why was Ms. Pinney being paid less than Craig. In other words, how do you justify paying a CIO over $100,000 but not someone who is running the financials of the company? Is it because he is the son or is it because he deserves more for his work in this area. Surely, the financials of the company should be important. Management has just started doing conference calls. On January 27, 2017, management started doing investor calls. Not necessarily a bad thing, but this was the first time I can find that the company hosted calls. Per Crunchbase, EDUC has been publicly traded since 1978. The first conference call didn't go so well. You can read the transcripts here. The second call took place on June 5, 2017, and the transcript can be found here. I appreciate the folksy manner of the calls, but the calls also suggest that at minimum the company could use more financial discipline. This section will highlight some of the issues with the conference calls. Issuing Stock? YES, well NO!!!, Okay Maybe. Who Knows? On Feb. 2, 2017, EDUC issued an 8-K disclosing that they had no plans to issue equity. Here is the quote from the 8-K. "On January 27, 2017, during an investor conference call held to discuss the financial results of Educational Development Corporation (the "Company") for the quarter ended November 30, 2016, the Company provided remarks that referred to our capital structure. To clarify these statements, the Company has no plans to issue additional capital at this time." Then in the most recent conference call held on June 5, Randall White had the following to say about the equity raising issue.    Guys, I guess I wasn't used to people hanging on my every word in that last call, because I got a call that said, 'What the heck?' They said, 'The moment you said issue stock, there were people getting off the call selling right there.' What I said was, at some point in time, well, I hope I live that long, but we're a $100 million company and we have adequate financials, financial backing, financial resources to do what we need. I would like to think at some point in time, let's say when the stock is $40, how about that, that we might issue a little bit."  Randall White seems to be suggesting that people misunderstood his comments from the first call. While, I read the first call first, and thought they were issuing equity as well. Then I read the second call and the 8-K. So, I went back to the first call to see what was said. There is a long discussion about how EDUC doesn't have access to capital to fund their rapid growth. Randall suggests that this is because of the way banks are analyzing his business. Note at the time they were not in compliance with their bank covenants because of the debt to equity ratio. But, I strongly encourage everyone to read the transcripts and form your own opinion. Randall's comments on equity in the first call. So we are looking at a long range how to improve capital structure and someone has got to come up with some equity, so we are looking at that." It appears that this comment suggests that they were looking into issue equity. But it does say "long range," so maybe Randall was really thinking more of a long-term solution, and not immediately. In response to a question, Randall discusses the following, Tony, I totally agree with you. It is dilutive, but if you've got a $7 million cap on your bank loan and you're going to go from $110 million to maybe $200 million, you know you are going to do what you've got to do. I don't have the answers all here, but equity is one of them. I do not want -- my plan was if the profits had been comparable to the revenue and we had the stock at $15 to $18, it was $17 a year ago. At $17 you put out 1 million shares from 4 million and get up to 5 million that is not dilutive at all. And that is what I had in mind. $8, I am not crazy about that. I agree with you, but a growing Company cannot be totally funded on bank debt." From this discussion, we can see a couple of things. First Randall seems to understand that it would be dilutive to issue stock at $8.00. But he also says "you are going to do what you've got to do." Then he goes on and says "equity" is one of the answers. Finally, at the end he says that a company cannot be funded on bank debt. This discussion says that equity was really being considered despite the negative issues it raises. Essentially that for the company to grow they would need the cash infusion. In the first call, Randall describes the equity in relation to treasury stock. Another item I might point out is our, the equity that is shown on the balance sheet is 14.5 million. There is also nearly 11 million of treasury stock. Now, the net or actually equity is 25 million less the 11 million treasury stock, which could be considered an asset because that stock could be sold to provide equity capital, which we talked to you about doing that in certain instances to increase our equity base." Randall views the treasury stock as an "asset" which can be utilized to raise money for the business. And he goes further to say they had considered raising money by selling stock. There seems to be a lot of discussion on the sale of equity in this conference call to allow a reasonable person to think that an equity raise was going to happen sooner rather than later. Also, when you look at the financials of the business, you get the sense that this will need to happen sooner or later. It isn't hard to imagine a company which borrowed $350,000 from the owner to cover payroll, stopped paying their dividend, and is not in compliance (at the time) with the bank notes, might be considering raising new capital through an equity offering. EDUC did announce that on February 07, 2017, that they received an amendment to the loan waiving the noncompliance from their bank. Other issues with the call that are worth highlighting. Customer service? - There is a section from the first call where Randall is describing the shipping issues they ran into, and how he "likes" when he gets a customer call after the customer has waited 2 hours on the phone. In his mind this means they really wanted the product. Not exactly a great customer service oriented CEO. I am not sure I want to wait 2 hours on the phone for a company. "Best of Luck" - There is another section that may indicate how Randall responds to any form of criticism. This shareholder raises a question about the purchase of real estate. He says the following, Randall, I fully sympathize with your operational issues. No small company could have coped with what happened to you operationally. So I am sure you will get it worked out sooner or later. However, you made a big mistake in my opinion in putting by based on your description in the call today, now $33 million worth of illiquid real estate on your balance sheet. I think addressing that issue before you address expanding the equity in the Company should be a top priority. I think you should reverse the decision you and the Board made to buy all that real estate. I think it should be sold and leased back, and I think the fact the stock is down from 17 to 18, well, yes, it is partially due to the operational issues. A very big chunk of it is due to the market simply displacing debt for equity value in the marketplace. You still have an enterprise value of 14 to 15 a share. But a big chunk of it is debt. And I think -- nobody has invested in your Company to have you reinvest in real estate. They have invested in your Company based on -" You can read the rest of the interaction. First, Randall tells him to take a "time out." And then eventually he says the following, The mortgage on this property is backed by a 15-year lease by a AAA company. And so that is our decision and I don't agree. So best of luck to you, pal." (Bold added for emphasis) This is a shareholder that is voicing a real concern. Randall works for the shareholders despite his large ownership stake in the business. And to dismiss his concerns in this manner seems to be inappropriate. Note: EDUC spent $23 million to purchase a 40-acre site, while owning a $3-million site 12 blocks away. Randall says that the purchase makes sense because Hilti, whom EDUC purchased the site from, is covering the mortgage via their lease payments. He then goes on to say that, because Hilti spent $6 million to repair their portion of the building that this has increased the value of the property. I have always hated this argument that the rents have been set, so EDUC cannot increase the rents to reflect this "new value." More questionable language: In the second call, towards the end of the call Randall seems to not to be sure how to end the call, so he starts talking about an event that EDUC has upcoming. And he says the following. All right. Dan? Heather, go out and sell something, Heather. We're going to have -- if you want to have a little fun, come to Tulsa next week, 1,700 women, all -- they're all mine, they're coming to convention, and we get to inspire them and motivate them and get them out there selling books." (Bold added for emphasis) About his consultants that are women, he says they are "all mine." This again seems to be very questionable behavior for a CEO of a publicly traded company. There is also a reference in the first conference call questioning the intelligence of his shipping employees because they are from Oklahoma. How many shares do Randall and Craig really own? On page 10 of the most recent proxy statement, we can see a rule regarding Section 16(a). I have copied the relevant language for your review. Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our directors, executive officers, and any persons holding more than ten percent of our Common Stock are required to report their initial ownership of our Common Stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the SEC and to furnish the Company with a copy of each such report. Specific due dates for these reports have been established and we are required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to file by these dates during and with respect to fiscal year 2016. To our knowledge, based solely on review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, during and with respect to fiscal year 2016, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were satisfied." I have added the bold language. To comply with this rule, most individuals file a Form 3 and Form 4. A Form 3 is a standard initial beneficial ownership disclosure filed with the SEC. And a Form 4 is used to update specific changes in ownership. Here is a copy of a Form 4 filed for Randall White. 

 The date of the document is 11/02/2009. And his ownership is stated as 777,193 shares. Why am I discussing a document from 2009? While this is the last Form 4 filed for all of EDUC, one possible reason would be that there has been no changes to the ownership, necessitating a filing. I could only find one filing for Craig White. It doesn't look like he ever filed a Form 3. 

 And this Form 4 was filed on 6/24/2008. 

 Next, I went to the proxy statements where EDUC reports the share ownership. I was to take that information for each of the years and create the following chart. 

 This is the stated ownership, of both Randall White and Craig White. Randall's reported number is going down slightly. And Craig's has gone up. But we do not have any transaction data to tell us what is happening. Form 4s are important so investors can see what the executives are doing with their stock. Why is this happening? I haven't been able to figure out why there are no Form 4s since 2009. There may be some exemption they are using, but the ones I looked at didn't seem to apply; for example, the size of the transaction. Also, the change in share ownership doesn't appear related to options being exercised or forfeited, but that wasn't very clear either. To be clear, this could be a clerical issue, an exemption I don't know about, or some attempt to hide the changes in ownership. The other side of the coin: Educational Development Corporation has been growing rapidly over the past two years. The question then is whether this growth is good for the long-term viability of the business. The first article I wrote questions the validity of that growth, and this article attempted to demonstrate some of the more qualitative issues happening at the company. The company is attempting to portray themselves as having normal growing pains of a large company. The mantra is something like the following, the purchase of a 40-acre property and inventory purchases are causing some temporary cash flow issues. Randall White stated that he wants to get the company to 8-9% pre-tax profits. He also discusses at length the issues they had with software they purchased. The question for any investor is whether the issues raised are simply growing pains that can be fixed over time or are they something bigger. The question for readers to decide is what narrative do you want to believe. Narrative A: EDUC is undergoing a profound shift and has the ability to grow substantially in the future to be a $200-million dollar company, or Narrative B: The company is changing and not for the better. The CEO seems to be focused on the wrong financial metrics, engaging in conference calls, issuing sales reports almost monthly, and pumping the stock higher while ignoring the basic corporate governance issues standard at other publicly traded companies. I have no position in this company long or short, nor do I have any form of derivative exposure. I had initially explored EDUC as a possible long, but I concluded that it was a company I wanted nothing to do with despite my interest in children's books arena.

ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
Â 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide âdevilâs advocateâ evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

About EDC




In 1973, Peter Usborne decided that educational, nonfiction books 
						would need to change in order to compete with TV and comics. He borrowed some 
						ideas from these two media and hired educational consultants to oversee the 
						writing to make sure that the books would satisfy the child's interest but also 
						arouse it.

						Explanatory books which merely explain are doing only half the job; if a book 
						fails to make its subject attractive and interesting to the reader, chances are 
						that the explanation will fail. Usborne Books are designed graphically to draw 
						the students in, to make them want to learn the material and to help them 
						retain that knowledge. The magic of Usborne Books is that they make both 
						reading and learning fun and not a boring or intimidating experience. Peter 
						Usborne set out to break down a child's resistance to reading and learning at 
						home. These books are so well organized that children absorb and recall much of 
						the vast amount of information presented.
					



Usborne Books are fascinating, lavishly illustrated books written with humor, 
						surprise and drama. They incorporate activities and puzzles to challenge a 
						child's observation and intelligence. Their superb printing quality and 
						exceptionally well-produced graphics, high ratio of pictures to text, short 
						magazine-like format and unique detail set Usborne Books apart from anything 
						yet produced. There is a wide range of subjects covering hobbies, history, 
						science, nature, foreign language, parent's guides and more. Usborne Books 
						truly appeal to all ages, infants to adults, with prices to suit everyone. The 
						books are printed on acid free paper, so the pages will last forever if taken 
						care of properly.


Â 


EDC is a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock market and was 
						recognized in November 1997 by Forbes Magazine as one of the 200 Best Small 
						Companies in America.


Â 


I am very proud of our company and the product line we represent, 
						and also very pleased with the response from our customers. Our goal is to 
						continue to provide the finest educational books for your children.


Â 


Randall White
						President and CEO


Â 


The Company



Educational Development Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was 
						incorporated in 1965 to develop curriculum materials for schools. In 1978 the 
						Publishing Division was created to distribute Usborne children's books, and the 
						Home Business Division was started in 1989.


Â 


Educational Development Corporation is the United States trade 
						publisher of a line of childrenâs books produced in the United Kingdom by 
						Usborne Publishing Limited. The Home Business Division distributes these books 
						through independent sales consultants who hold book showings in individual 
						homes and through book fairs, fund raisers and direct sales. The Home Business 
						Division is also responsible for sales to school and public libraries. The 
						Companyâs Publishing Division distributes the books to book stores, toy stores, 
						specialty stores and other retail outlets throughout the United States.


Â 


Our Product Line



Usborne Publishing Limited produces award winning books that are of 
						excellent quality and cover the ages of preschool to adult. The subject matter 
						includes a wide range such as history, languages, natural science, crafts, 
						parent guides, puzzles and beginning readers. These subjects along with many 
						other subjects make our product line one of the most complete in the industry. 
						The Company presently offers over 2000 different titles in its product line and 
						has recently added a line of fiction titles.


Â 


The 
						Companyâs product, "Usborne Kid Kits," combines some of our more popular titles 
						with special items to complement the information obtained within the book. 
						These are packaged in 2 different ways. One as a reusable vinyl bag with handle 
						and snap closure and the other in a neatly designed box. There are currently 65 
						different kid kits available with more in the planning stages.

Â Â Other 
						products include CD-ROMS, such as Frog Prince and Noahâs Ark, as well as 
						several jigsaw puzzles.


Â

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
Â 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide âdevilâs advocateâ evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.
