Legal Information


 





                                Important Legal Information

By accessing this web site, the pages contained on it, and the products, services, information, tools and material contained or described herein (the "Site"), you acknowledge your agreement with and understanding of the following terms of use.

Information supplied
The content available on this Site was prepared and assembled by Credit Suisse AG and MultiConcept Fund Management S.A.. All details are intended purely for information purposes and are aimed exclusively at investors in Luxembourg. On no account is the information supplied to be regarded as offering investment recommendation or financial, taxation or other professional advice. The investment funds referred to herein may not be suitable for everyone and interested persons should consult a qualified specialist before taking investment decisions.

No reliance may be placed for any purpose on the information or opinions contained on this Site or their accuracy or completeness. No representation, warranty or undertaking, express or implied, is given to the accuracy or completeness of the information or opinions contained on this Site by Credit Suisse AG or MultiConcept Fund Management S.A and no liability is accepted by Credit Suisse AG or MultiConcept Fund Management S.A for the accuracy or completeness of any such information or opinions.

Sales Restrictions and Fund Documents
This Site is not directed to any person in any jurisdiction where (by reason of that's person nationality, residence or otherwise) its publication or availability is prohibited. Persons should inform themselves of such prohibitions and, if subject to local restrictions of this type, must refrain from accessing this Site. The material contained on this Site is not an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any financial products or banking services in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation of purchase or sale would be unlawful.

The investment funds mentioned on this Site have been authorized by the Luxembourg Supervisory Authority (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) and as such can be marketed in and from Luxembourg. 

The investment funds may be purchased only on the basis of the most recent sales prospectus, the key investor information document (if a UCITS) and the most recent annual report (or half-yearly report, if this is more recent). These and the fund management regulations or articles of the investment funds may additionally be obtained free of charge from the fund management company MultiConcept Fund Management S.A.  and from Credit Suisse Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A., P.O. Box 369, L-2013 Luxembourg.

Tax laws and potential tax consequences
Transactions in investment products are subject to tax laws and provisions under various legal jurisdictions: e.g. in the legal jurisdiction in which the investment products are issued or in which the issuer is domiciled; in the legal jurisdictions in which the investment products have invested; in the legal jurisdictions in which these investment products are held in the safekeeping accounts of investors; in the legal jurisdiction in which the investors are domiciled or resident or are subject to tax obligations. 

Potential investors are personally responsible for informing themselves about the applicable tax laws and provisions and for complying with them in connection with the subscription, purchase, holding, sale, redemption or distribution of investments. Statements about transactions in investment products may not be construed as tax advice on the part of Credit Suisse AG or MultiConcept Fund Management S.A. It is recommended that investors carefully consider the potential tax consequences of such investments, as needed with the assistance of a tax advisor, and compare them with the tax consequences of investing in other products. It is also important to note that investors must still themselves compile and/or supplement the data for the calculation of taxes even where such data has been automatically prepared on the part of Credit Suisse AG or MultiConcept Fund Management S.A. 

Risk Considerations:
PAST PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OR GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE REGARDING FUTURE PERFORMANCE. INVESTING ENTAILS RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF ALL INVESTED MONEY. THE PRICE OF, VALUE OF AND INCOME FROM SECURITIES OR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CAN FALL AS WELL AS RISE. CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO HIGH VOLATILITY, AND MAY EXPERIENCE SUDDEN AND LARGE FALLS IN THEIR VALUE. LOSSES MAY EQUAL OR EXCEED YOUR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES THAT MAY HAVE A POSITIVE OR ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE, PRICE OR INCOME OF SUCH SECURITIES OR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THERE ARE ALSO SPECIAL RISK CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL INVESTING (ESPECIALLY EMERGING MARKETS), SMALL-COMPANY INVESTING, SINGLE-INDUSTRY FUNDS OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, SINGLE-COUNTRY OR REGIONAL FUNDS OR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, OR OTHER SPECIAL, AGGRESSIVE OR CONCENTRATED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, SUCH AS THE USE OF LEVERAGE OR DERIVATIVES. INVESTORS IN SECURITIES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS EFFECTIVELY ASSUME THESE RISKS.
