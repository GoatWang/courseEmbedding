Alexander Gordon-Brown - Effective Altruism You do not have Javascript enabled. Some elements of this website may not work correctly.Alexander Gordon-BrownQuantitative traderAlexander first encountered the ideas of effective altruism back in 2010, before it even had a name. He heard an interview with Toby Ord, an Oxford University Professor, on the Daily Politics, advocating for a charity he had founded called Giving What We Can. Toby had pledged most of his lifetime income to effective charities, and was encouraging others to donate at least 10% of theirs. Alex saw the truth in the ethical reasoning behind donating to help others, but says he didn't expect the idea to catch on beyond small circles of academics.A few years later Alex revisited Giving What We Can and was delighted to see he'd been proved wrong. The community had gathered several hundred members who had each agreed to donate at least 10% of their lifetime incomes, and at this point Alex and another friend decided to sign up too; in fact, Alex committed to giving away over half of his own income. Whilst the ideas behind effective altruism had seemed fairly obvious to Alex from the beginning, it was another thing to discover a community of people who were actually living by those ideals.In terms of his own career, Alex was already on the trajectory of being a quantitative trader when he started learning more about effective altruism. However, interacting with the careers advisors at 80,000 hours did help him to solidify his will to go down this route, and his commitment to donate acts as an ongoing motivator in his work. So far, he has focussed his donations on global poverty organisations as well as charities working within effective altruism. In the future he plans to continue using his resources towards the overall goal of leaving the world better off than he found it.Part of the seriesCommunity Profiles1. Lincoln Quirk2. Anjali Gopal3.

Alexander Gordon Brown1947 - 2014It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Alex on August 10, 2014, at the age of 67 years. Alex passed away peacefully at the Fort Qu'Appelle Hospital surrounded by his loving family, after a difficult battle with cancer; he gave a good fight, but could not fight it any longer. Alex was born in Valley Center, Saskatchewan on March 23, 1947 to Patrick and Regina Brown. Alex was predeceased by his father Patrick, mother Regina, sister Shirley, brother Ron, son Nicholas, daughter Shirley Ann and father-in-law Alex Bohun. Alex is survived by his loving wife Darlene, daughter Jenna (Gary), son Tyson (Nicola), his pride and joys: his granddaughters Makenna and Lynea, brother Wayne (June), Larry (Julie), Leon (Judy), sons Derek, Christopher, mother-in- law Helen Bohun, brother-in-law Kelvin Bohun and numerous nieces and nephews. Alex was a man who loved life to the fullest, loved his family, friends and people. He was always willing to help anyone, always caring and giving. He had a sense of humour that will not be forgotten; he touched many hearts. For the past 17 years, Alex and Darlene managed RV parks, 14 years for the city of Lloydminster, and the past three years at Katepwa. He took great pride in how his parks looked and his patrons enjoyment with their stay. He would be cruising on the gator from morning until night, making sure the work was done and helping anyone who needed a hand. Alex loved life and was a social butterfly, making many friends wherever he went, but three friends at Katepwa, Carl Wilson, Dennis Temple and Terry Fay, truly brought out Alex's love of friends, laughter and their many travels in the valley. Their stories, jokes and friendship brightened everyone's day. These true friends really made Alex's last years here his best. Alex loved the peace of the valley. He will never be forgotten; stories many, memories tons, missed always, forever in our hearts. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Stars Air Ambulance in Alex's Memory. The family would like to thank Dr. Tuwor and the nursing staff at Fort Qu'Appelle Hospital for the care and respect that they gave Alex and the Regina Funeral Home and Sallows & McDonald Funeral Home in North Battleford. Funeral will be Wednesday, August 20 at 10 a.m. at Sallows & MacDonald Funeral Home North Battleford. Interment to follow with Deacon Ed Lemko officiating. Celebration of Alex's Life will be held at Katepwa later this fall. Date will be announced.
