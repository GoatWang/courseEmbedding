New Study Reveals Hilarious Truth About Socialists
May 25, 2017 By Kimberly Morin Leave a Comment  Share Tweet Pin CommentThis probably won’t come as a surprise for many of you, since you deal with far-left-wing, Bernie-style socialists on a regular basis.
A study was conducted at a university in London where they tested men to see if there was a difference in physical makeup between those who believe in socialist-style policies and those who do not. From The Daily Wire:









An academic study from researchers at Brunel University London assessed 171 men, looking at their height, weight, overall physical strength and bicep circumference, along with their views on redistribution of wealth and income inequality. The study, published in the Evolution and Human Behavior journal, ​found that weaker men were more likely to favor socialist policies than stronger men.
Brunel University’s Michael Price believes this may be a product of evolutionary psychology.
Pretty sure a study wasn’t need to verify what most people already know, but hey, why not:

 


Other studies in the past have also suggested stronger men are more right-wing than physically weaker men. “Researchers found that men’s opinions on redistribution of wealth could be predicted by their upper body strength, with powerful men more likely to take a conservative stance of protecting their own interests,” noted The Telegraph of a 2013 study from Aarhus University in Denmark.
This gives the term “pajama boy” all-new meaning now, especially with studies to back it up.





Interesting that it seems when pajama boys can’t compete, they prefer to use the force of government.

HUGE Section of I-85 Collapses In Atlanta, But Something Seems Strange About Alleged Cause
March 31, 2017 By Kimberly Morin 19 Comments  Share Tweet Pin Comment









There was a massive fire under a major highway in Atlanta yesterday that caused a bridge to collapse and a complete nightmare for commuters that will possibly continue for months until the highway is repaired.
As reported by Yahoo News:
Atlanta’s notoriously tangled commutes were thrown into disarray Friday after a massive fire caused a bridge on Interstate 85 to collapse, completely shutting down the heavily traveled highway through the heart of the city.

 


Georgia’s top transportation official said there’s no way to tell when the highway, which carries 250,000 cars a day, can be safely reopened to traffic in either direction following the collapse in the northbound lanes leading out of the city.
McMurry said Friday in a news release that bridge inspectors have determined the southbound lanes of I-85, adjacent to the section that collapsed, also were damaged by the fire and will need to remain closed for the foreseeable future.
He said the fire started in an area that was used as a storage location for construction materials, equipment and supplies. Authorities were still working to determine how the fire started.

So they don’t know the cause of the fire but they seem to know for sure that it wasn’t terrorism and it may have been something really ridiculous:
Capt. Mark Perry of the Georgia State Patrol told the newspaper terrorism is not suspected. Gov. Deal told reporters PVC plastic materials in a vehicle may have caught fire.
How do PVC materials just “catch fire?” Well, let’s take a look at PVC.org:
PVC is an inherently fire resistant plastic, the only exception among the general-purpose plastics, since it contains more than 50% of chlorine.

 


When PVC products are burned, hydrogen chloride gas resulting from thermal cracking slows down the continuous combustion reaction and prevents burning progress by warding off the PVC product surface from oxygen in the air.
Other advantages of PVC are that it releases less combustion heat than other plastics – hence contributes less to maintaining and spreading fire – and produces no or very few flaming droplets or debris.
The investigation is under way and they will eventually figure out what started it but it seems a bit “odd” that fire-resistant PVC materials just randomly caught fire.





In the meantime, Atlanta commuters are in for a few months of painful commuting, more painful that the traffic they deal with in that area on a regular basis.
