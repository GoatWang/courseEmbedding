The Wave 3D patented urinal screen releases more than twice the active ingredients as look-alike screens, over 30 days to keep the urinal and restroom smelling fresh. The Wave doesn’t' just mask, it releases optimized bacteria that consume odors. The revolutionary design features a post & lattice design extending through the screen and diffuses the urine stream while releasing a pleasant fragrance. The 2-sided anti-splash design removes 99% of urine splash either side up! The Wave 3D easy reminder system lets you know when it's time to replace the screen. Simply remove the tabs upon installation to set your replacement date.

Details

The Door Fresh provides a great looking way to freshen any restroom with a variety of new fragrances designed specifically for women. It continuously freshens the women’s restroom at the source and in the air for 30 days. The Door Fresh uses the movement of stall and entry doors to create air flow that activate the fragrance. The high-end design and discrete look of the dispensers is a win for even the most discriminating customers. The doorfresh’s Brain dispenser is mounted by the entryway door, and reminds you when to replace all of the refills in the entire restroom, using both a blinking red LED reminder and an audible reminder if the refills are not changed after several days. The Drone dispenser, sleek and small, keeps the refills locked and secure inside each stall, at a very low cost. The door fresh provides unparalleled air freshening performance at a competitive cost.
