For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Lehman's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

Act Or Do Not Act.  Please read the Notice carefully.

United States District Court for the Southern
  District of New York

The Court’s Settlement Hearing
The
Court will hold a Settlement Hearing at 4:30 p.m. on December 10, 2013, at the
Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, Courtroom 21B,
New York, NY 10007.  At this hearing, the
Honorable Lewis A. Kaplan will consider whether the Settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate.  The Court also
will consider the proposed Plan of Allocation for the Net Settlement Fund and
the application of Class Counsel for attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of
expenses.
 
What is this case
about?
This
class action Settlement involves securities known as structured products that
were issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and underwritten and sold by UBS
Financial Services Inc. in 2007 and 2008. 
Structured products are a kind of security that consists of a fixed income
security and a type of derivative, such as a basket of securities, options,
commodities, or foreign currencies.  Some
of the structured products involved in the class action also offered “principal
protection.”  A list of the structured
products that are part of this Settlement can be downloaded by  clicking here.
The
lawsuit alleges that UBSFS violated federal securities laws in underwriting and
selling the Structured Products.  The
plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the offering materials for the
Structured Products contained materially false and misleading statements and
omitted material information about Lehman’s financial condition and about the
“principal protection” feature of some of the Structured Products.  During the litigation, the plaintiffs also
inquired into the procedures by which UBSFS structured, marketed, and sold the
Structured Products, the sales commissions earned, and communications between
UBSFS financial advisors and customers. 
UBSFS denies that it did anything wrong, or that any purchasers of
Structured Products incurred losses due to any alleged misrepresentations or
omissions in the offering materials.
 
The Settlement Benefits
A Settlement Fund of $120,000,000 (before deduction of
attorneys’ fees and expenses and administrative costs) will be distributed to
certain investors who bought or acquired the securities identified on  Exhibit A
during the relevant time period, and who make a “Recognized Claim” under the
proposed Plan of Allocation.  Plaintiffs
estimate that Settlement Class Members who purchased or acquired Structured
Products with a total face value of approximately $892 million may have
suffered damages during the relevant time period.  Assuming all Settlement Class Members submit
valid and timely claims, plaintiffs estimate that the average recovery per
damaged Structured Product under the Settlement is $1.34 for Structured
Products with a face value of $10.00 and $134.00 for Structured Products with a
face value of $1,000.00, before
deduction of Court-awarded attorneys’ fees and expenses and administrative
costs.
You
can use the proposed Plan of Allocation to calculate your Recognized
Claim.  It is unlikely that you will
receive the full amount of your Recognized Claim, however, because your payment
will depend on the number of valid Claim Forms that
are received and the total of all Settlement Class Members’ Recognized Claims.
The Plan of Allocation can be downloaded by  clicking here. 
 
The Rights of the Settlement Class Members
If you are a Class
Member, you have the following options:
 
Submit a Claim Form
If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member, to be eligible to share in the distribution of the Settlement proceeds,
you must timely submit a valid Claim Form, which can be found by clicking here, postmarked
no later than February 4, 2014.  If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member and do not submit a valid Claim Form, you will not be eligible to share
in the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund, but you will nevertheless be
bound by any judgments or orders entered by the Court in the Action.
 
 
Exclude
yourself from the Settlement
If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member, but wish to exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must submit
a written request for exclusion that is in accordance with the instructions set
forth in the Notice and is postmarked no later than November 19, 2013.  If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member and do not timely exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you will
be bound by any judgments or orders entered by the Court in the Action.
 
Object
to the Settlement
Any objections to the proposed
Settlement, Plan of Allocation, or Class Counsel’s application for attorneys’
fees and reimbursement of expenses must be mailed to the Court, Class Counsel,
and Defense Counsel in accordance with the instructions set forth in the
Notice, and received by each no later
than November 19, 2013.
