 Educational Background



B.S. Degree 


The George Washington University

                  The George Washington University actively engages Washington, D.C., and the world. Their location in the heart of Washington places them at the core of U.S. government, policy and law. They sit where the worlds of science, technology, media and the arts converge. Their students and faculty have the unparalleled opportunity to study and work alongside leaders and practitioners in every discipline, to take part in the interchanges that shape our community and the world.
The George Washington University was created in 1821 through an Act of Congress, fulfilling George Washington’s vision of an institution in the nation’s capital dedicated to educating and preparing future leaders.
Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. They have more than 20,000 students—from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries—studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy.
GW comprises three campuses—Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, Va.—as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, Va.                




MBA 


University of Chicago - Booth School of Business

                  The University of Chicago Booth School of Business is a graduate business school located in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Chicago. Formerly known as the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S., the first such school to offer an Executive MBA program, and the first to initiate a Ph.D. program in business. The school was renamed in 2008 following a $300 million endowment gift to the school by alumnus David G. Booth. The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school.

The school's flagship campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on the main campus of the university. The school also maintains additional campuses in London and Asia (originally Singapore, but in July 2013 a move to Hong Kong was announced), as well as in downtown Chicago on the Magnificent Mile. In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of finance, economics, quantitative marketing research, and accounting. Chicago Booth is currently ranked first in the United States by Bloomberg Businessweek and first globally by the Economist.                





 Career History



Director & Chief Portfolio Strategist

                                    2014 - Current                


Ancora Inverness LLC


                  Ancora Inverness generally creates portfolios to meet each client’s particular investment goals. Portfolios may consist of a combination of individual stocks, individual bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other fixed income securities. Portfolios typically exhibit a contrarian bent with a valuation discount and yield advantage to broad market averages such as the S&P 500 Index. The firm's equity investment methodology uses a combination of fundamental research and technical security analysis to identify individual securities that are likely to generate superior returns over time while minimizing risk of loss. They may use a combination of individual securities, mutual funds, and ETFs to achieve appropriate diversification and to achieve targeted exposure to attractive segments of the markets. Ancora Inverness may also employ alternative investments such as private equity,energy, and real estate investments to add diversification or to hedge portfolios to stock market and interest rate risk. Ancora Inverness' Managed Allocation strategy is targeted toward helping high net-worth individuals preserve, protect and grow their assets by utilizing traditional assets classes (large cap equities, small cap equities, bonds) while incorporating additional asset classes such as real assets (commodities, REITs and infrastructure assets such as oil & gas pipeline operators) and alternative investments (lower correlation, non-long only/hedged strategies) into client portfolios when appropriate. The purpose of including these additional asset classes is to generate a potentially more diversified pool of return streams through the use of active (individual stocks and mutual funds) and passive (ETFs) management.The firm manages and invests in fixed income securities based on the current interest rate, economic, and inflationary environment of the markets. They structure fixed income portfolios using instruments issued by the US Government or agencies of the US Government, states and municipalities, investment grade and non-investment grade US and foreign corporations, foreign governments, and convertible bonds or preferred stocks of high quality US and foreign corporations. fixed income mutual funds or ETFs may also be utilized. As to maturity and quality, the US Treasury yield curve and interest rate spreads (differential between treasuries and other types of securities) dictate how bond portfolios are structured.                




Director, Chief Portfolio Strategist, Portfolio Manager

                                    Current                


Ancora Advisors LLC


                  Ancora Advisors invests primarily in undervalued securities that have attractive prospects for capital appreciation. They employ a bottom-up security selection approach in which they select securities one at a time based on assets, operating performance and long-term fundamental business prospects. Ancora Advisors seeks to purchase ownership positions in companies whose current market values are less than their private market values. To determine private market value, the firm focuses on a company's financial fundamentals and valuation. Ancora examines and forecasts company's sales, earnings and cash flow trends, with a view toward the economic realities of the business. Balance sheet and cash flow analysis is conducted, with a focus on capital requirements, proper capitalization and tangible asset value. These factors are then weighed in combination with a company's current valuation and growth potential.Ancora Advisors looks for companies in industries with attractive prospects and business fundamentals. Their analysis focuses on understanding the competitive positioning of the company under consideration with a view toward long-term franchise value and management reputation. Ancora also seeks to invest in companies participating in large, growing markets. They favor industries that engender the building of sustainable franchise value, barriers to entry and high margins. These may result from consumer brand value, a differentiated product, oligopolistic market dynamics or a superior cost structure. Many of these companies have sizable recurring revenues attached to long-term customer relationships.Ancora Advisors is an activist firm and is included in the SharkWatch50 as one the 50 most prominent activist investors.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
