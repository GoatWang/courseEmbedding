From Publishers Weekly

Elmer the elephant is a colorful character. His heady optimism and unbridled sense of humor keep the entire community in a cheery mood. And Elmer's unusual multicolored checkerboard hide is the wonder of all the other elephants, who are characteristically gray. In spite of his sunny disposition, Elmer begins to feel conspicuous. He starts to believe the others are laughing at him because of his crazy patchwork coat. When Elmer discovers a bush in the jungle with elephant-colored berries, he shakes the bush and rolls in a berry mash until he is as gray as the others. Now no one seems to notice him; for a time he enjoys his anonymity, but after a while he begins to realize just how quiet and dull things are when he's not around. Finally the practical joker in Elmer emerges, and he soon has the whole gang laughing again. McKee's gentle humor and love of irony are in full force in this celebration of individuality and laughter. Well-designed spreads are washed with stunning color and the use of textured, painted and airbrushed surfaces contributes to the powerful visual impression. Ages 4-7. Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.


From School Library Journal

PreS—The story of the patchworked pachyderm, who just celebrated his 25th birthday, is now available in board book form. A new generation of children can traipse through the jungle with Elmer as he meets friends and learns to embrace his unique style. Though the text might be a tad long for toddler storytimes, the bright colors and comic facial expressions will charm young listeners.


Review

“McKee’s gentle humor and love of irony are in full force in this celebration of individuality and laughter.” (Publishers Weekly)

David McKee's Elmer the Elephant Is A Necessity for Childrens' Libraries

By Rita Brundage
Such a sweet story that children will love! Elmer is a likeable character with whom many children can relate, as they join him in solving his problem. My school students loved this story and when I've purchased it for friends' children/grandchildren, they too loved the story.

I have loved the Elmer books since I read the first one

By C. Jewell
I have loved the Elmer books since I read the first one... Who wouldn't love a nice bright elephant?  I bought this book and the plush and another elephant book to send to an unknown child for a book exchange.

Troubleshooting Guide
Need help troubleshooting your faucet problem? Follow our simple 4 step process to make a successful faucet repair. To begin troubleshooting a problem you need to clearly identify what product you're using and what is currently wrong with that product. After determining what the problem is you may need to replace a part. You can obtain the necessary replacement parts through the Pfister Parts Online Store or by calling Customer Service at 1-800-PFAUCET (1-800-732-8238).
Step One: Identify Your Product

The first step to faucet repair is to identify the product you are working with. The product model number (usually an 8 digit code, ie. F-529-7AYY) is displayed on the product package and on the instruction manual right below the product name.

Below are examples of where to find a model number: 




 Package:

 Instruction Manual:





If you do not have the original packaging or are not able to locate the model number, you can identify your product through several characteristics. For help identifying your product if you don't have the model number, click here.

Step Two: Find the Source of the Problem
Once you've identified your product you can use our Technical Document Search to locate installation manuals, maintenance guides, and parts explosions for your product. These documents show you how to clean the aerator, a common cause of low water pressure, and how to take apart the handle. You can also review the installation manual to make sure your faucet is installed correctly.
Step Three: Order Replacement Parts
Once you have identified the source of your problem, you may need to obtain replacement parts. If your product is covered by our Lifetime Warranty, please contact our customer service team for your product parts:
1-800-PFAUCET (1-800-732-8238). You can also order replacement parts online through our partner, Faucet Direct: Pfister Parts Online Store.

 Trusted since 1910, Pfister has been a leader in quality plumbing products. Style, beauty, and durability are what give Pfister faucets the edge over other manufacturers’ products and when combined with the decorative and wear resistant finishes, you are assured years of trouble-free service.  All faucets are backed by our Pforever Warranty®, covering finish and function for as long as you own your home. Following the warranty information below you will find important details on how to maintain the quality of your new faucet.
Downloadable Warranty

Proof of product purchase or of original home ownership is required in order to obtain any of the benefits set forth below. (Commercial applications limit duration of warranty, as provided below)
Limited Warranties: Pfister warrants that for as long as the original purchaser owns the home in which the Pfister product (the “Product” excluding the electronic sensor, control box,  power unit, GE filter manifold and GE filter cartridges) is originally installed, the Product will be free of all defects in material and workmanship that would impair the intended and proper use of the Product.

Pfister warrants against deterioration of the Product’s finish for as long as the original purchaser owns the home in which the Product is originally installed. If the Product is installed in a commercial application, the above finish warranty for Products that do not contain the Pforever finish shall be limited to a period of five (5) years from the date of purchase.
Exclusive Remedy: In the event of any defect in the Product that breaches the foregoing warranties, Pfister, at its option, will have you send, prepaid, the defective part or product to us for inspection, or we may elect to send the replacement part.

  			Get the Bathroom of Your Dreams with the Ideal Bath Fixture
  		










			Bath fixtures are the crown jewels of any bathroom. From bath faucets to showerheads, The Home Depot has a wide collection of styles & finishes that are both durable and functional. Not every bath faucet will work with every sink. When selecting bathroom faucets for your home, it is critical to make sure that the bath faucet installation type is compatible with your sink. A bathroom faucet is a simple change that can give a whole new look to your bathroom, and set the tone for your entire lavatory design and style. While bathroom faucets are a critical component of any bath, one of the more important parts of your bathroom aside from the sink, is the bathtub & shower. A bathtub faucet comes in an array of shapes and finishes. These bathtub faucets should be coordinated with the shower faucet and the finish of other faucets in the room for a coordinated bathroom decor.   
A rainfall shower head will add a great feeling of peace and tranquility to any shower. Bring your own raincloud to your bath and turn any shower from ordinary to awesome. Featuring a rain-like spray for total body coverage, this type of shower matches up with a bathroom faucet giving you a spa-like experience and leaving your body feeling rejuvenated. While a bathroom sink faucet and bathtub fixtures are of upmost importance in your design, it is also important to choose high quality fixtures that are built to last. At The Home Depot, we have a variety of high-quality bathroom fixtures and a faucet for you, including a bath faucet and bathtub faucet that not only look good, but offer durability & quality at great prices. Our professional associates can guide you through the wide range of bathroom faucets & fixtures available for your bathroom and assist in the narrowing down of your choices to help you find the perfect fixture and faucet for your bath. At The Home Depot, we can offer you the top bathroom faucet and bathtub faucet brands to go with an unbeatable assortment of styles & designs that will coordinate your bathroom and put the finishing touches on your bath.

 Educational Background



Graduate 
Class of 1986 


Yale University - Yale Law School

                  Located in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale Law School is one of the world’s premier law schools. It offers an unmatched environment of excellence and educational intimacy in the form of world renowned faculty, small classes, limitless opportunities for clinical training, and strong encouragement of public service. The Law School is small by design; its impact on the world is measured by its accomplished graduates and its ongoing scholarship and outreach through numerous centers and projects.

For students, the experience is unparalleled. The faculty-student ratio supports a vast array of courses and opportunities for independent research and student-organized seminars. Students get practical training by representing real clients in clinics starting in their first year.

Throughout, a spirit of collaboration reigns. All first-term courses are ungraded, and subsequent classes are graded honors/pass/low pass. 

Yale Law School is unique among law schools in that it produces leaders in all walks of life: distinguished deans and faculty members at law schools across the country and the world; industry CEOs and corporate counsels; founders of nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit entities; entrepreneurs; government servants in federal, state, and local offices and the judiciary--just a few areas in which our alumni's talent and passion and dedication have made a difference. Among the School’s graduates are U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices; and among its far-reaching projects, the Information Society Project and the China Center.                




Bachelor of Arts with Honors in Economics, summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa 
Class of 1983 


Lake Forest College

                  Lake Forest College is a four-year coeducational private liberal arts college in Lake Forest, Illinois, on Chicago's North Shore. Founded in 1857 as Lind University by Presbyterian ministers, the college has been coeducational since 1876 and an undergraduate-focused liberal arts institution since 1903. Lake Forest enrolls approximately 1,600 students representing 47 states and 81 countries. Lake Forest offers 30 undergraduate major and minor programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and features programs of study in pre-law, pre-medicine, communication, business, finance, and computer science.The majority of students live on the college's wooded 107-acre campus, which is located a half-mile from the Lake Michigan shore.

Florida Bar Association

                  The Florida Bar is the integrated bar association for the state of Florida. It is the third largest such bar association in the United States. Its duties include the regulation and discipline of attorneys.

As elsewhere in the United States, persons seeking admission to the bar must pass a moral character screening, in this case administered by the Florida Board of Bar Examiners. Admission to the bar includes passing a background investigation, the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, and the bar exam, which tests both the common law through the Multistate Bar Examination and Florida law through written state essays and state-specific multiple-choice questions. The Florida Bar is home of one of the nation's premier board certification programs. Over 5,000 members of the bar are certified in one or more of 24 legal specialty areas including civil trial, business litigation, labor and employment, and marital and family law. Board certified attorneys must submit to a rigorous peer review process, prove substantial involvement and education in the specialty field, and pass a written examination.

The Florida Bar's headquarters building and annex are located in Tallahassee, three blocks from the Florida State Capitol.
