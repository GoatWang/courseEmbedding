Paid Time Off


Each full-time employee is allotted hours for Paid Time Off (PTO) based on position and years of service. This time can be used for vacation, sick leave, or any other time the employee needs to be away from the office.


Holidays


Exactech’s policy includes eight paid holidays and one floating holiday. The paid holidays include New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day & the day after, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The floating holiday can be used on any day of the year. Employees starting after August 1st, do not receive a floating holiday until the following year.


Insurance


Exactech offers group medical insurance. You will be eligible to participate in the plan the first day of the month following the completion of thirty days employment. Health Insurance is available for all employees working a regular schedule of 30 hours or more a week employees through Florida Blue.

We offer flexible spending and health savings accounts, which allow you to have money deducted on a pre-tax basis for payment of medical and dependent care expenses.
Exactech offers employees the opportunity to purchase dental, vision and short-term disability insurance.
Exactech provides long-term disability to you.
Exactech provides $50,000 of life insurance.  You have the option to purchase additional life insurance coverage.



Retirement Benefits


Exactech offers a 401(k) to all full-time employees who have completed 90 days of service. The company will match 100% of the first 5% of the employee’s annual base salary contributed to the plan.


Employee Stock Purchase Plan


Employees are given the opportunity to share in Exactech’s success through stock ownership. Exactech offers employees the option to purchase Exactech stock at a 15% discount via payroll deduction. Employees are eligible to participate at the beginning of any quarter.


Profit Sharing Plan


All regular employees in good performance standing are eligible to participate in Exactech’s profit sharing plan during the first full quarter of employment. In each quarter that Exactech achieves its upper guidance for Earnings Per Share (EPS), all eligible employees will receive a profit sharing payment in the amount of 2% of their quarterly salary; if we exceed the upper end of the guidance the amount of the profit sharing payment will become 3% of the eligible employee’s quarterly salary.
Because profit sharing is dependent upon the company’s performance, it is not a component of regular pay. Since the inception of the program, we have had quarters in which payments were made and quarters for which no payment was possible.

Medical Devices Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Medical devices are durable and disposable in nature.  These devices can be used for a wide variety of conditions for surgical procedures, home health care, clinical settings or in the medical office setting.  A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent or anything similar which can be used to diagnose, prevent or treat a disease within the body.  It can be as simple as a tongue depressor, medical thermometer or disposable gloves.  It can also be as complex as a computer which can assist in medical testing, an implant like a stent or a prosthesis.  Globally, the medical device market is over $209 billion.  
 Medical devices are classified in one of three regulatory classes, the classification is dependent on the intended use of the device and indications for use.  The US accounts for approximately 38% of the global medical device market.  China, Japan, Russia and Brazil have the most stringent regulatory compliance for medical devices. Research can be found within market research industry reports which will further outline economic industry trends, device regulation globally and challenges facing medical device leaders.
