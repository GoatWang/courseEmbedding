A Child Is Born in Bethlehem (Puer Natus in Bethlehem)
arr. David H. Sargent

Organ Solo









   








A Child Is Born in Bethlehem (Puer Natus in Bethlehem)
A Child Is Born In Bethlehem for Organ Solo was commissioned by Douglas Bush for one of his  European performance tours.  He requested a Baroque style piece because he would be  performing on Baroque organs.  Their tuning requires the use of a limited harmonic palette.  Sections of the piece include a straight forward chorale statement, decorated melody, a fugato section, and has a majestic ending. Even though it begins in c minor, it is in a minor.

Abide with Me Tis’ Eventide (Parkinson, Violin)
arr. Kelly Clark Parkinson

Violin


















Abide with Me Tis’ Eventide (Parkinson, Violin)
Kelly Clark-Parkinson has chosen a number of traditional and religious tunes, and she works the material from the inside, never overshadowing the melodies but instead seeking their highest, purest form. Ms. Clark-Parkinson is a tremendous instrumentalist. Here, she serves the material, letting the beauty of the melodies she has chosen take the forefront, rather than spoiling the mood with unnecessary pyrotechnics and flourishes (of which she would certainly be more than capable.) The arrangements aren’t simple or dumbed-down, they are just right.
This is track 06 from Kelly Clark Parkinson’s album:  “How Sweet the Sound”

Ms. Clark-Parkinson is a tremendous instrumentalist. Here, she serves the material, letting the beauty of the melodies she has chosen take the forefront, rather than spoiling the mood with unnecessary pyrotechnics and flourishes (of which she would certainly be more than capable.) The arrangements aren’t simple or dumbed-down, they are just right.
This is track 07 from Kelly Clark Parkinson’s album:  “How Sweet the Sound”

An Irish Blessing
Rock Oakeson

An Irish Blessing
An Irish Blessing, TTBB a cappella (1997)
Rock Oakeson served for several years as Pianist for the Salt Lake Men’s Choir, and during this time was often asked to arrange and compose pieces for the group.  At one point he was asked to create a “signature” piece to be used at concerts and church performances, often as the encore.  The result was this setting of the traditional Irish prayer, familiar to many.  Slow and mellow, with a wandering sense of harmony, this piece is ideal both for the concert hall and church service.  It is intermediate in difficulty.

Angels on Tiptoe
Kathleen Holyoak

Vocal Solo


















Angels on Tiptoe
“Angels on Tiptoe,” a contemporary Christian and title song for Kathleen’s album, was written in the effort to comfort a family who lost their teenager in a tragic accident.  In Kathleen’s own words:
“I wanted to write a song that would help a grieving family to know that we have angels, seen and unseen, who lighten our way and whose presence is with us each step of the way.“  
 
Since then, young and old have found comfort with words that touch the heart and soul:
 
“Upon wings of silence, they watch through the day.
Your guardian angels will show you the way.
They tiptoe beside you, enfold you with love.
They play on your heart strings the songs from above.”

Angels We Have Heard on High (Piano Solo – Tonioli)
Angels We Have Heard on High – arr. Jason Tonioli
This is one of my mother’s favorite songs.  She sang in a choir as a teenage girl.  For one of their concerts, choir members stood on a platform shaped like a Christmas tree during a holiday concert.  Singing with the choir, the harmony of the “Gloria In Excelsis Deo” chorus reminds her of how the hosts of heaven singing must have sounded.

Another Christmas Carol (pdf book)
Another Christmas Carol (pdf book) – Daniel Carter, author
 
In Another Christmas Carol, Daniel Carter shares his experiences of the true meaning of Christmas—and of love—and the power of hope. This heartwarming novella of brotherly love and the determination to keep a dream alive is sure to become a treasured favorite.  In this true story, Daniel faces constant opposition as he works to realize his dream of becoming a professional musician.  A childhood accident left him with 9.5 fingers, but he didn’t let that stop him from composing.  In college, although his parents want him to major in something more practical than music, they show their support by giving him the family piano.  But his college professors dismiss his composition and performance skills and scoffed at his dream. Finances become so tight that to pay his tuition, he decides he must do the unthinkable and sell his piano.  Selfdoubt and academic probation continue to plague him. Then on a cold, snowy December night, his spirit re-ignites with an unexpected gift.

Away in a Manger (SSAA – Nielsen)
arr. Matthew B. Nielsen

SSAA with Soloists and Optional Instruments









   








Away in a Manger (SSAA – Nielsen)
One of my favorite musical inventions of the 21st century is the “mash-up.”  Used mostly in popular music styles, the general idea of the technique is to take two or more songs and combine them, intertwining their musical themes and rhythmic ideas to create new musical ideas.  I enjoy using this pop music technique in my works for the concert hall.  In this piece, you’ll hear this used mostly in the second verse. While the sopranos sing the melody, the altos sing an altered version of the hymn “The Lord Is My Shepherd” as a counter melody.  Meanwhile, the accompaniment borrows from “Joseph Dear, Oh Joseph Mine,” “The Wexford Carol,” and “Mary’s Lullaby.” Combined with the “Coventry Carol” transition between the first and second verses, there are five different songs and carols that will be heard.
While the piano accompaniment illustrates the musical borrowing, the pastoral nature of this setting is best heard when using the instrumental accompaniment. The original arrangement is scored for flute, oboe, guitar, and piano. The parts are included here, with an alternate piano/vocal score for when the instruments are being utilized. Feel free to use any C instrument that works for your choir. The guitar is optional, but I highly recommend it, as it really adds to the overall sound.
It was a joy to write this arrangement, and I hope you enjoy performing it.

Duet, Two-Part Vocal









   








Away in a Manger (Two-part vocal – Leavitt, John)
I love this arrangement of “Away in a Manger” by John C. Leavitt for Two-part vocal, violin and piano.   It is just lovely.   I was sold on this piece the first time I heard it.
In this moving and tender setting of the favorite Christmas song Away in a Manger, there is a great feeling of love and liberation. The piano part gently flows along like water, the violin climbs and soars in quartal steps, and the two women’s voices lovingly describe the scene of the birth of Christ. Notice that the tone and tempo of the last verse change and become as still and reverent as the prayer that it recites. A simple arrangement, but one that contains a deep and moving spirit. Great for a duet, or a two-part women’s chorus!

SATB









   








Be Not Afraid
Be Not Afraid (SATB) – Janice Kapp Perry and Ann Kapp Andersen, composers/arrangers
This motivating anthem is a powerful treatise on walking by faith through all of the challenges and trials of our lives. No stranger to trials himself, John V. Pearson penned these poignant lyrics a few years before his passing at an early age. Combined with the music of Janice Kapp Perry and now the choral arrangement by Ann Kapp Andersen, it stands as a strong testimony of how we must trust God’s way in every aspect of our lives. It would enhance any church meeting and could especially fortify missionaries as they depart.

Be Thou My Vision (Piano Solo – Tonioli)
Be Thou My Vision – arr. Jason Tonioli
The music for this song is an Irish folk song entitled, “Slane”.  David Evans combined the old Irish text written in the 6th century with the folk melody and it was first published in the 1927 edition of the Church of Scotland’s Hymnary.  It is now sung in churches around the world and is widely known as “Be Thou My Vision.”
A popular arrangement of this melody has been performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in which they combine the folk melody Slane, with the text “Take Time to be Holy” which was written by William D. Longstaff.
I decided to include this arrangement in this Christmas book because even though it may not be considered a traditional Christmas carol, the message of a Savior in this song is clear and is certainly fitting for the Christmas Season.

Beautiful Savior   – Alexander and Aubrey Woods, arrangers
With Beautiful Savior we tried to create the sincerity and genuine love of Jesus through a child’s eyes.  Perhaps you will see the beautiful light that surrounds us, or maybe hear birds singing.  Maybe even a music box on the second verse.  Whatever you hear, we hope to express the perfect beauty of our Savior.

Beautiful Savior (Piano Solo – Tonioli)
Beautiful Savior – arr. Jason Tonioli
Of all the traditional Hymns that refer to the Savior, I felt like this one captured the Christmas Spirit.  I included this in this Christmas book because it has always reminded me of a lullaby you would sing to a baby.  What better way to recognize the baby Jesus, than with this music that was written for Him.
This song is also entitled “Fairest Lord Jesus.”  The music and lyrics were written by German Jesuits in the 17th Century and is known as a Silesian folk song.  The version most people are familiar with was arranged by Richard S. Willis in 1850.

Beautiful Zion (SATB – Strobel)
Beautiful Zion – Robert Strobel, composer
My setting of George Gill’s “Beautiful Zion” reflects the exciting and celebratory feelings that happen when one thinks about the millennium or Zion. I also envisioned a nod to those who came before us who sacrificed so much (and went so far) for religious freedom.  Overall, the setting would thrive in a light conducting style. The melody is lyrical and free flowing and leaps often giving a sense of exultation. While the first two verses are rather upbeat, the final verse is a climax that peacefully concludes into a restful cadence.

Behold the Lamb of God
Kathleen Holyoak

SATB, organ









   








Behold the Lamb of God
Behold the Lamb of God, by Kathleen Holyoak, won the first place award in the Church Music Submissions in 2002 and a standing ovation in concert.   Arranged for mixed Chorus (SATB) and organ,  it is a wonderful choice for the opening or closing title for a Christmas worship service or concert. Written in a Classical style for choir but enhanced with dissonance and modern rhythms  in the organ accompaniment, the music builds to an exciting and glorious ending. The first verse, with words written by Lawrence Lee, is as follows:
 
            Break forth into joy, oh Israel,
            Behold the Lamb of God.
            He comes to earth this joyous day
            to spread His light abroad.
            Angel voices raise their song,
            Join in praise with Heaven’s throng.
            Break forth and sing, “Hosanna,
            Hosanna to our King.”

By Acts of Faith
By Acts of Faith – Janice Kapp Perry, composer;  Ann Kapp Andersen, arranger
 
This piece is a masterful treatise on faith beginning with an intriguing description of Jesus walking on the water (in Matthew 14:25-33):
“By acts of faith the heart may know
the truths the eye can’t see.
Where reason fails, the Lord prevails
and walks across the sea.
By acts of faith the spark of hope
is fanned into a flame.
And God will show His miracles
by faith in Jesus’ name.”
This new choral arrangement could be sung in any religious setting.

Christmas Solos – Book (printed hardcopy)
Daniel Carter

Vocal Solo









           








Christmas Solos – Book (printed hardcopy)
Christmas Solos – Book (Hardcopy) – Daniel Carter, composer
Here is a book of Christmas songs for soloists.  A few of these songs have been around for quite a while but most are fairly new.  “Shine for Me Again, Star of Bethlehem” has been around since 1981, but this version is transposed a little higher and has a different accompaniment.  There are also a couple of other pleasant surprises.
You will note that there are two songs I did not write.  When songs as beautiful as these come to my attention, I find it irresistible in sharing them with others.  I know you will love them as I do.  My friend Rebecca Berg, who wrote them, is a gifted songwriter and singer.  I hope that people will find and sing more and more of her beautiful contributions.
I hope you will enjoy singing, celebrating and proclaiming the Savior’s birth with this collection of songs!  – Daniel Carte
A New Star, A New Hope
As with Gladness
(Imagine) The First Time Mary Held Him
The Christmas Story
From Regions of Glory
Shine for Me Again, Start of Bethlehem
The Songs They Sang that Night
Was I There?
A Heavenly Shepherd
He Who Built the Starry Skies
What Does Christmas Mean?
My Best Gift.

Come Thou Fount / If You Could Hie to Kolob (Violin Solo – Parkinson)
arr. Kelly Clark Parkinson

Violin









 








Come Thou Fount / If You Could Hie to Kolob (Violin Solo – Parkinson)
Kelly Clark-Parkinson has chosen a number of traditional and religious tunes, and she works the material from the inside, never overshadowing the melodies but instead seeking their highest, purest form. Ms. Clark-Parkinson is a tremendous instrumentalist. Here, she serves the material, letting the beauty of the melodies she has chosen take the forefront, rather than spoiling the mood with unnecessary pyrotechnics and flourishes (of which she would certainly be more than capable.) The arrangements aren’t simple or dumbed-down, they are just right.
This is track 03 from Kelly Clark Parkinson’s album:  “How Sweet the Sound”

Testimonial 



















HI Frank, I can't tell you how happy I am with the counter and with Mike. The look of this kitchen has totally changed for the better. Love the color and the job is perfect. All in all, everything turned out great and we are very pleased. Can't thank you and Holyoke Millwork enough for taking care of us. Please tell Gary how happy we are. See you soon!

P. Rigali ~ Countertop installed in South Hadley
 
 
Thank you again for your patience! I absolutely love the floors. Chris' work was excellent on all accounts, the tile, the wood, and reinstalling the baseboard. Thanks to Dan too! It looks like a totally new place!
You can count on my very high recommendations to others who might ask for a reference for flooring! The service and workmanship exceeds!
 
N. Georgantis~ Tigerwood Hardwood and Tile installed in Chicopee
 
Hi Frank! 
Word of mouth is the BEST and LEAST expensive advertising. Everything looks great, done in a timely fashion, with experienced installers. Thank you so much!
M. Welch~ Hardwood and Vinyl Tile with Grout installed in Holyoke.
 
Gary,  "We  compliment the great products and service Holyoke Millwork provided us  on our master bath & bedroom renovation through our contractor Ron  Gnatek. We are very pleased we chose HMW for our tile and flooring  products. From the beginning of the process, Frank made our tile and  carpet selection easy and pleasurable, treating us like friends he has  known forever. Chris Weaver did an awesome quality job in tiling  the  shower and floor. Really impressive work! The carpeters completed the  bedroom and hall in only 2-hours from start to finish, leaving us a  seamless and tight carpet. The Adura flooring we choose for our entry  and dining room is gorgeous! Manny really is a 'craftsman' leaving a  floor with a beautiful impression to all that enter our home. Thank you  and please pass our "Job Well Done" on to all your staff.
~B. Bowden~ tile, vinyl, and carpet installed in Belchertown.
Frank,
I Would like you to know how pleased we are with our new carpet installation. The crew, Kurt and Mike, were first rate and lived up to your endorsement. They were on time every day, professional and careful of our belongings. The results show—the carpet looks great. A quality experience from beginning to end.
Special mention is deserved for Kurt and Mike’s care and concern when we had a plumbing emergency. Had it not been for their quick reaction the damage could have been worse. We would welcome both men into our home anytime.
Our thanks to you personally and Holyoke Millwork for job well done.
~R. Kessler~ Carpet installed in Longmeadow
 
When it comes to doing home improvement projects in our house our first thoughts are HOLYOKE MILLWORK. We’ve used them in the past for several projects. We’ve found them to be friendly, professional, and very helpful in choosing products. Their workmanship is always of the highest caliber. With their professionalism, many fine products and their impeccable workmanship, the end result ALWAYS out does our expectations.
~E. and P. Moriarty~ carpet installed in Holyoke
 
Frank- carpet looks amazing! Installers were prompt, professional, cleaned up after themselves and worked quickly.
Thanks for all of your help!
~J. Rome~ Carpet installed in Longmeadow
 
Thank you for installing such beautiful carpet in my front hallway, staircase and large basement room. Your staff is always professional, courteous, and efficient. I will gladly recommend Holyoke Millwork to anyone considering home projects.
~F. Gillon~ Carpet installed in Holyoke
Hi Gary,  "Annette called me today and was just gushing about how much she loves her new floor.  She is thrilled!  What impressed her so much is the fantastic job you did.  She sang your praises to high heaven saying that everything was so neat and clean and the installation didn't impact her life at all.  You really made a friend when you hooked her VCR back up.  She said that she is telling everyone she knows who needs flooring to go to you.  In fact, she has a friend who was supposed to stop down at your store on Friday.  By the way, I told her that the reason I recommended you to begin with was your high quality work and your professionalism.  So congrats on a very satisfied customer."~ L. Dupont~ Carpet installed in Chicopee   Dear Gary,  "We would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Frank, John and the rest of your associates for the incredible work recently completed for our kitchen project.  The laminate floor has gotten so many positive comments and people are convinced it is tile.  You guys truly outdid yourselves on the counter top as it came our way beyond our expectations.  The quality and workmanship that went into both projects left us completely satisfied and in awe.  What a difference working with a professional company and staff that truly cares about it's customers.  We would not hesitate to recommend Holyoke Millwork to anyone that is thinking of having counter top or floor work done to their home.  Thanks again to you and all your staff."~ D. and B. Belisle~ Countertop and laminate floor installed in Chicopee    Frank,  "John installed the carpet for both the down stairs room and the upper bedroom.  On the first day he came he brought breakfast for himself with a thermos of coffee.  Even though it was his breakfast, he was selfless and offered both the bagels and coffee to my wife and daughter.  After the install of carpet, he fixed the strip that connects the hardwood floor to the carpet by gluing it down ( a safety hazard ).  That was not part of the initial job and in my opinion was above and beyond. When the second room was installed, before he left he noticed the carpet was "fluffy" (lifting) near the stairs.  Instead of ignoring the issue, he mentioned to my wife the possible tripping hazard, and he corrected the issue.  In my opinion he again, went above and beyond. Not only did he do the above items, he did a great job on the install, it looks great.  THAT is how to keep business. Great work ethics John!!! Because of the great service from Holyoke Millwork, I see myself being a customer for life.  Thank you for a job well done.  "~ P. Bovat Jr.~ installed carpet in Enfield, CT    Gary & Crew, "Thanks again for the great job.  I love the floor and was very impressed with the professionalism and speed of all of you.  Thanks Again."~ R. LaBelle~ vinyl installed in South Hadley    Dear Gary, "Thank you so much for the great job you and your workers did on our counters - They look great!"~ M. and A. Cashman~ Countertop and vinyl in Westfield  Frank, "Paula and I are very happy with the purchase and installation of the congoleum.  The installer was excellent.  We cannot say enough about his workmanship and attitude.  Our whole experience starting with you was excellent.  We will gladly recommend you to anybody."~ A. Huot~ carpet installed in Westfield    "I wanted to let you know that I am very pleased with the work your employees Jon and Tim did laying the tile in my bathroom.  They were pleasant and courteous, and did a very good job cleaning up after the work was all done.  Thank You"~ J. Brochu~ ceramic tile installed Granby    Gary & Co.  Thank you so much for changing my kitchen from the 80's to 2009.  I love it!  The sink and faucet are in too.  Loved the professional job you and Tom did."~ M. Crochiere~ Countertop installed in Ludlow  Hi Gary,  "Thank you.  The new carpet looks great and the guys did a wonderful job."  ~ Liz ~ Carpet installed in LongmeadowFrank,  "Once again your crew has come through in a timely and professional manner.  Thank you for your patience in helping us along the way. We are very pleased with the color choice and the way in which it enhances the room. We will enjoy it for many years." ~ A. and P. Flood~ Carpet, Laminate Floor, and Countertop installed in Chicopee    Frank and the Millwork Crew,  "Thank you so much for the wonderful job on our office and break room floor.  It was truly a pleasure to work with a conscientious and pleasant group of people such as yourselves.  Thanks you again."~ B. Powell Jr.~ Vinyl tile installed in SpringfieldDear Gary & John,  "I want to thank you for the wonderful job you did installing my new wood floor.  Most of all I want to thank you for making my life easier.  You took care of it all for me and I am grateful." ~ A. Grace~ Hardwood installed in Westfield     Frank, Sales Representative,  "I would like to extend my appreciation to you for the excellent level of customer service that I received from your company. In addition, I must acknowledge the outstanding work ethic and professional expertise of Manny  the professional master vinyl installer.  I look forward to enjoying the enhancements made to my kitchen for years to come." ~ S. Stanley~ Vinyl installed in Springfield     Gary,  "How can we thank you enough for the outstanding and professional service your company conveyed to us.  We had our backs up against the wall with the timing of our move, and you met the demands beyond our expectations. Your installers are to be commended and please offer our sincere thanks to them.  They worked endlessly to complete the job in one day.  We Love the carpet!"  ~ K. LaValley~ Carpet installed in South Hadley
