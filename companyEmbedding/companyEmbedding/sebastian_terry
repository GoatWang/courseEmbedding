Published on Jul 7, 2014Sebastian Terry - "Selflessness - Put On Your Oxygen Mask First"After the loss of a close friend, Sebastian Terry decided to create a bucket list, detailing all of the things he wanted to experience or accomplish before he died - no matter how odd or seemingly impossible. In the process of ticking those items off of his list, he inadvertently created a global movement, challenging the world with the question, "What's On Your List?" In this inspiring and poignant talk, he shares his humorous and humbling experiences with PTTOW! and challenges us to create our OWN list - because you never know whose life you may change in the process of changing your own.PTTOW! is an invite-only, member network and summit that brings together inspiring leaders from the world's most innovative companies, along with cultural icons, to showcase game changing projects and fuel transformational media partnerships shaping today's culture. :: http://www.pttow.com

Product Description

        Have you ever allowed yourself time to think about what's really important to you? Something you have always dreamed of doing? In a moment of reflection after the loss of a friend, Sebastian Terry's answer is a list of 100 things, the things he's always wanted to do. Sebastian embarks on an incredible adventure which sees him Get Shot in Colombia, Crash the Red Carpet at the Cannes Film Festival and Cycle Through Cuba - all in an effort to ensure he lives a life without regrets. Now more than halfway through his list, Sebastian has realised that his journey is part of something so much bigger . . . 100 Things is a humorous, action-packed story for anyone who's ever dreamed about living every day like it was their last.

100 Things
A Helping Project Powered by the Poo~Pourri Community



We believe in magic. Why shouldn't we? We have the power to make stinky situations better.
Poo~Pourri is proud to partner with 100 Things—a global movement inspiring others to set and achieve goals. Our goal is to make someone in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area's dreams come true. And we need your help.







If you or someone you know could use our help making a wish come true, email us at [email protected].
We’ll choose one person and together we’ll make magic!







Everyone has at least one thing they want to do in life – some even have a list. But how many goals and dreams on your list have you actually achieved? Inspired by the death of a close friend, Sebastian Terry created a list of 100 Things to do. The crazy thing is, he did them. One man’s no-holds barred adventure to find purpose has grown into a global movement of people chasing their dreams and helping others do the same. We are driven by the desire to help people and spread positivity throughout the community. We want to test the limits of the notion, “What can one person do?”
How does this work?
There are five steps to our 100 Things Project:

Nomination - We’re calling on you, the Poo Community, to nominate someone in the Dallas/Ft. Worth who deserves some help with a goal or a dream.
Selection – We’ll review the nominations and contact nominees we believe we can help for more information.
Call Out – We’ll announce our selection and call out to the Poo Community, for volunteer, donors and support to make this dream come true.
Action – We’ll plan, coordinate and ultimately make someone's dream come true.
Reveal – We’ll show you, the Poo Community, the journey!

What is the 100 Things Project?
The 100 Things Project is a helping project powered by the Poo Community. Our aim is to make a dream come true and encourage others to achieve their own dreams.
How did the 100 Things Project begin?
For Sebastian Terry, the death of a close friend combined with a naturally abstract view on life led him to create a list of 100 things he wanted to accomplish.
When will the 100 Things Project be chosen?
The deadline for nominations is June 30th. We’ll review the nominations and contact nominees we believe we can help for more information. We’ll announce the final selection the week of July 10th – stay tuned! 
What kind of nominations are you accepting? 
We need you to nominate someone who needs help—including yourself! We are focusing on experience-based wishes and therefore, will not consider monetary requests.
How will you fulfill the wish? 
Wishes are only made possible by the generous support of our local community.
How do I start my own 100 Things list?
Join Seb or learn more about his 100 Things Movement at 100Things.com/au.

For more information on the 100 Things Project or to submit a nomination, please email [email protected].

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Create Your Next Big Thing










Sebastian Terry – 100 Things 
By Geoff McDonald on November 6, 2014 in Book Reviews, Manifesto 

When are you most alive? What are the most weird and most cooky things you’ve ever done?
Whilst this is one-way to look at Sebastian Terry’s book 100 Things it’s probably not the most useful frame.
Let’s try this instead…
What are the things that you’ve done in your life that made you feel most alive?
Stop and have a think about this. I think it’s a great life question.
For instance, have you been on a scary roller coaster ride that put you on the edge of your seat? Have you become a parent and watched with joy and admiration as your child stumbled, stood up and then shined? Or, consider the pride you felt at completing that special something that you didn’t think you could.
Feeling fully alive is a super powerful question that builds on what Todd Henry is talking about in Die Empty.
Ten Things by Sebastian Terry
If you want some suggestions as to some activities that would make you feel fully alive then consider this list of ten things:

Marry a stranger in Las Vegas
Deliver a baby – and not yours!
Break a world record
Get shot! Yes, deliberately set out to get shot.
Perform a marriage ceremony. Yes, a legal marriage ceremony
Walk across a country, eg France
Get a tattoo
Appear as a sports mascot
Crash the red carpet at Cannes Film Festival
Stay silent for an entire week

100 Things
These ten outrageous things are all part of Sebastian Terry’s 100 Things list. It’s a bucket list of things to achieve. And, yes, there are 90 others amazing things on his list! His journey started at the crossroad between completing college and starting a job. Added to this was the sudden death of a close friend. It sparked a rethink of life for Seb.
He asked himself this question:
If I knew I was going to die, would I change anything?
Perhaps, right now is a good time to stop and reflect on this question. Are you ready to die?


Seb asks a great question: If I knew I was going to die, would I change anything? via @Seb100Things

Manifesto
My point is not death. It’s life. And Seb’s point is not doing crazy stuff. It’s life. In particular, it’s doing things that bring you to life. That brings you fully alive!
And, my interest in this is two-fold. I want to feel more fully alive. And, in writing about manifestos I have the tool to do it. A bucket list of 100 things is a form of manifesto. It’s a super simple way to express your intent in the world and make a public declaration about it. It says, ‘Here’s what I want accomplish in my life’.
The Power of Public Declarations
And, Sebastian Terry’s story is a fantastic example of what might happen if you go public with your declarations. As he started his adventure he shared it publicly by blogging about it. And, along the way he attracted a strong following that built a momentum of help and support. It reached a point where people were emailing him to help complete his list. And, this opened up a host of doorways to complete things that seemed impossible or unlikely otherwise. For Seb, sharing his list in public was akin to drinking Red Bull. It gave him wings!
My Top 10
Here’s my top ten…

Grow a Forest – 100 acres planted with food and other native flora.
Start a Research Centre
Publish a Book – done that x 4, now aiming for 10 books
Present at TED
Receive an honorary Doctorate
Speak French – at least have a reasonable conversation in French.
Get married.
Exhibit my art and create a sellout show.
Earn a million dollars – if you knew my bank balance right now you’d be laughing at this thought!
Spend a month in Paris painting and visiting the Musee Picasso – 2015!

What’s on your list?
One of Sebastian Terry’s 100 Things was to write a book. And, that’s what we’ve been talking about here. It’s an engaging story with short sharp chapters making it an easy read. I gobbled it up in two days. Inspiring stuff!
So, the obvious question is this…
What’s on your list? What are you the things that you could take on to inspire you to be fully alive?
