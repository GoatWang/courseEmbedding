DataTrace Pro Software
3 Reasons to Use DataTrace Pro





Powerful Reporting Capabilities



In the food processing industry, we need lethality data to know whether the product is safe to eat. Autoclave customers processing for sterilization will need reporting capabilities to display pass or fail criteria for their process. All of this information can now be graphed and displayed all on one report with just one extra click for a quick, easy-to-read review of the process for anyone to check the results. The robust reporting capabilities of the DT Pro software provide beautiful reports with graphs and calculations such as lethality, pre- and post-calibration verification displays of loggers before and after the process, and a placement view of the data loggers. This is an efficient solution for a reporting engine with no post-processing required. Time and energy spent post-processing data in excel or other calculation software can be put elsewhere while the DT Pro software does that work for you.





In Software Pre- and Post- Calibration Verification



There is a requirement to perform As Found results before use in EO, because once the gasses have affected the sensor, you need to prove that it was in calibration the next time it is used, right before use. Being able to do pre- and post-calibration on your own saves a lot of time and hassle.
The software offers a “set it and forget it” type of calibration with industry standard controls and the ability to assess to a certain specified tolerance. It can calibrate loggers directly in the software and communicate with industry standard or leading metrology equipment. This saves time and energy while giving you the control over the calibration to determine which data points are being checked and verified. Your loggers will be kept within tolerance while removing hassle from the equation. Please note, it is still recommended that you receive factory calibration once per year, but performing it in house simplifies the process.





21CFR Part 11 Compliance



When it comes to 21CFR Part 11 compliance, if you are not compliant, you cannot use the data loggers and software, so it is imperative to know what regulations you need to meet and whether your software is compliant. 21CFR Part 11 compliance is great for pharmaceutical communities with regulatory compliance needs under the FDA that need to show they are meeting requirements on a regular basis. DT Pro software is 21CFR Part compliant and has the ability to maintain regulatory compliance while processing and handling data.

Inside Data Loggers





Data Loggers Overview



A data logger is an electronic device used to record data over time in a particular position or placement. Data loggers are designed to measure a wide variety of conditions and processes and selecting a proper data logger for a particular process can become somewhat challenging. As data loggers have evolved over time, their design has become much more specialized and their construction much more robust and customized. Programmable data loggers can be used to gain a lot of information about a process. The user dictates the intervals in which a reading is logged and, as is the case with DataTrace, can even dictate how and when the logger communicates it data to the server/software. Used in conjunction with its powerful reporting software, DataTrace Pro (DT Pro), DataTrace data loggers can be extremely useful for identifying cold spots, establishing sterility assurance or validating new equipment or processes.





Data Logger Placement



In order to record the most accurate data, placement of data loggers is of the utmost importance. The closer a data logger can be positioned to the actual product/items being monitored, the more accurate the data is and the more information you have about the product itself as it is processed. Because of this, DataTrace MPIII and MPRF data loggers have been designed so that they can retrieve data from within a container or within the product itself.





Temperature Data Loggers



Many data loggers are designed to measure temperature. Some measure ambient temperature, as in a room or warehouse, while others are intended to measure temperature in processes that are much more extreme such as a lyophilization process or inside an autoclave. Processes even reaching higher in temperatures (such as depyrogenation) are monitoring with data loggers, but not every data logger can monitor any process. DataTrace data loggers are engineered specifically for extreme environments such as steam, ethylene oxide and other various sterilization processes and chambers, heat tunnels, retorts, smokehouses, food processing and more. Autoclaves/steam sterilization, retort sterilization, dry heat ovens and tunnels, curing processes, food pasteurization and several other processes rely on accurate temperature measurements to ensure product/patient safety, product integrity and process reliability. Though critical to many applications, temperature data logging is not the only crucial parameter that DataTrace data loggers can be useful for.





Humidity Data Loggers



Humidity data loggers must be able to accurately record RH across the full humidity spectrum. Accuracy for humidity data logging is often of prime importance as humidity can alter or negatively impact product, it can be detrimental to equipment or materials, and can drastically alter the effectiveness of other processes. In Ethylene Oxide sterilization processes for instance, there are a number of factors to monitor. Certainly levels of EO are important as well as the temperature inside of the process or vessel. Central to the effective delivery of an ethylene oxide insult, humidity must be monitored closely to ensure that the sterilization process is successful. Typical EO sterilization processes require humidity levels to be near 50%, while humidity levels near 30% may be low enough to cause process failure.





Pressure Data Loggers



Recording the pressure data from a canning, pouch or other food process is vital to ensure the safety of the items and the efficacy of the process. Pressure data loggers must be rugged to withstand the environment while also accurate enough to detect the smallest variances when monitoring food processing, supply lines, and other various industrial applications. A complete data logging system consists not only of high quality data loggers, but also incorporates software to collect, read, graph and report on the data after or, in the case of DataTrace RF, during the process itself. DT Pro gives the user the flexibility to fully customize reporting, data analysis and to program data loggers and logger groupings.

Inside Biological Indicators





Overview



According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a biological indicator is a test system containing viable microorganisms providing a defined resistance to a specified sterilization process. Biological Indicators (BIs) have been in use for several decades and are used in hospitals, food processing, tattoo parlors, dentist offices, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing, ambulatory surgical centers and anywhere else where validation and verification of an adequate sterilization cycle is required.
BIs come in many different shapes, sizes and configurations. Spore Strips have been in use for several decades and are still very widely used for a variety of sterilization processes. Self-Contained Biological Indicators (SCBIs) have become much more popular over the past 30 years, as they are more user friendly and often offer reduced incubation times. For situations where typical BIs are not appropriate, suspensions are widely used to directly inoculate product/substances and Mesa’s line of industrial use BIs are available to test the lethality of a sterilization cycle in a very specific area of a product or load.





Steam Indicators



Steam sterilization is the most popular type of sterilization and Mesa offers several different indicators to monitor the wide variety of items that are sterilized in steam. The variety of items being monitored is what has predicated the development of the variety of indicators that Mesa offers. Porous items (towels, hard goods, etc…) are easily monitored with Spore Strips while the use of test packs with SCBIs is ever increasing. Ampoule indicators are best utilized in liquid loads sterilization (bottles, media, etc…) and offer a variety of sizes for flexibility. Mesa also offers a complete line of Chemical Indicators including Class 5 (Integrators) and Class 6 (Emulators), Bowie-Dick type test packs and more.





Gas/ Ethylene Oxide Indicators



Ethylene Oxide sterilization is one of the most common sterilization methods for medical devices including specialty device kits used for specific surgical procedures. EO sterilization is most useful due to the fact that it uses a reduced amount of heat and is therefore safe for heat sensitive materials and devices.  Because of this, a completely separate type of biological indicator must be used for sterility assurance testing and monitoring. Utilizing a different species than our steam products, Mesa’s offers EO BIs as spore strips, SCBIs, test packs, suspensions, custom BIs and chemical indicators as well.





Dry Heat Indicators



Dry heat sterilization requires longer cycle times, higher temperatures and specialty biological indicators. Spore strips can be used in dry heat sterilization however as temperatures rise, charring becomes an issue and the indicator itself burns. Mesa offers a couple alternatives to spore strips with stainless steel discs and with its product DriAmp. DriAmp is an ampoule containing sand inoculated with spores which can withstand extreme temperatures. Additionally, Mesa offers chemical indicator labels for use with this process.





Specialty Indicators



Mesa has created a host of biological indicators for specialty sterilization processes including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), low-temperature steam with formaldehyde (LTSF), gamma irradiation, propylene oxide and more.

Inside Dialysis





Dialysis



Dialysis is based on the diffusion and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. As blood flows past one side of a semi-permeable membrane, dialysate flows by the other side. Fluid and smaller solutes and pass through the membrane, but larger substances (e.g. large proteins and red blood cells,) are blocked by the membrane, mimicking the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys.





Hemodialysis



Hemodialysis works by removing waste and water from circulating blood by filtering it outside the body through a dialyzer which contains a semi-permeable membrane. Blood and dialysate flow in opposite directions, contributing to the concentration gradient that allows the maximum amount of urea and creatinine to be removed from the blood.





Dialysate Solutions



Dialysis solutions contain similar levels of certain minerals (e.g. calcium, potassium) as healthy blood. The blood of dialysis patients contains higher levels of potassium and urea than the dialysate so constant replacement of the dialysate through the dialysis process maintains this imbalance ensures that undesired solutes are removed from the patient’s blood. For bicarbonate, the level is set slightly higher than healthy blood to encourage diffusion. Individual patient needs dictate the concentrations of the components of dialysate, typically prescribed by a nephrologist.





Digital Dialysate Meters



To ensure patient safety, Mesa offers several digital dialysate meters to help the nephrology technician verify that the dialysis machine is functioning properly. The pHoenix, HYDRA and NEO-STAT test various parameters utilizing Mesa’s easy to use syringe style concept which is small in size and offers a host of advantages including a large, digital display, one-touch calibration and an auto-off battery saving feature.
In addition to these syringe style digital dialysate meters, Mesa offers its 90XL technician meter which can be used to test and calibrate all types of delivery systems and water purification systems.





Calibration



Mesa Labs maintains a sophisticated calibration lab for all of its instrument products, including its line of digital dialysate meters.
Mesa’s in-house calibration is far more extensive than the user calibration options available to our customers. Mesa’s dialysate meters, in general, have two sets of calibration coefficients. A set that is exposed to the customer/user and is used to make minor adjustments to the accuracy of the device and a set that is exposed, in general, only to Mesa’s in-house calibration software.
Also, Mesa’s Calibration lab has the N.I.S.T. traceable standards at the facility to calibrate the meters to. A typical user doesn’t have access to N.I.S.T. traceable standards.
Lastly, if there is an issue with the function of the meter, Mesa has the OEM parts to correctly service, repair and re-certify a customer’s meter. Should an instrument or meter need repair, it can only be accomplished at our factory.

Inside Dialysis





Dialysis



Dialysis is based on the diffusion and ultrafiltration of fluid across a semi-permeable membrane. As blood flows past one side of a semi-permeable membrane, dialysate flows by the other side. Fluid and smaller solutes and pass through the membrane, but larger substances (e.g. large proteins and red blood cells,) are blocked by the membrane, mimicking the filtering process that takes place in the kidneys.





Hemodialysis



Hemodialysis works by removing waste and water from circulating blood by filtering it outside the body through a dialyzer which contains a semi-permeable membrane. Blood and dialysate flow in opposite directions, contributing to the concentration gradient that allows the maximum amount of urea and creatinine to be removed from the blood.





Dialysate Solutions



Dialysis solutions contain similar levels of certain minerals (e.g. calcium, potassium) as healthy blood. The blood of dialysis patients contains higher levels of potassium and urea than the dialysate so constant replacement of the dialysate through the dialysis process maintains this imbalance ensures that undesired solutes are removed from the patient’s blood. For bicarbonate, the level is set slightly higher than healthy blood to encourage diffusion. Individual patient needs dictate the concentrations of the components of dialysate, typically prescribed by a nephrologist.





Digital Dialysate Meters



To ensure patient safety, Mesa offers several digital dialysate meters to help the nephrology technician verify that the dialysis machine is functioning properly. The pHoenix, HYDRA and NEO-STAT test various parameters utilizing Mesa’s easy to use syringe style concept which is small in size and offers a host of advantages including a large, digital display, one-touch calibration and an auto-off battery saving feature.
In addition to these syringe style digital dialysate meters, Mesa offers its 90XL technician meter which can be used to test and calibrate all types of delivery systems and water purification systems.





Calibration



Mesa Labs maintains a sophisticated calibration lab for all of its instrument products, including its line of digital dialysate meters.
Mesa’s in-house calibration is far more extensive than the user calibration options available to our customers. Mesa’s dialysate meters, in general, have two sets of calibration coefficients. A set that is exposed to the customer/user and is used to make minor adjustments to the accuracy of the device and a set that is exposed, in general, only to Mesa’s in-house calibration software.
Also, Mesa’s Calibration lab has the N.I.S.T. traceable standards at the facility to calibrate the meters to. A typical user doesn’t have access to N.I.S.T. traceable standards.
Lastly, if there is an issue with the function of the meter, Mesa has the OEM parts to correctly service, repair and re-certify a customer’s meter. Should an instrument or meter need repair, it can only be accomplished at our factory.

Thank you so much for the data! It looks really nice and is a vast improvement over the testing from the other company we used. I really appreciate your effort and quick turnaround! We will definitely be using Ebatco for future testing. I am very impressed.

Turnaround and response time were excellent. The report was professional and well-written. I would definitely recommend us this service again.

Your previous service allowed us to prove that our supplier was not performing to specifications and were able to recover an enormous loss due to bad product.

Ebatco offers quality analytical services with a remarkable turnaround time. As a subcontractor, Ebatco has expanded the offerings of our company’s services which has enabled us to grow revenue with new contracts.

With your help of DLS and Zeta potential measurement, we have published our paper in Advanced Functional Materials.


― Lina Niu, Ph.D., at a Major University ― 







We could successfully utilize the characterization data provided by you in interpreting our research results in the area of nanodispersions.
