Gary L Ellis's Experience
Title: Member
               Company: Project Management Institute
Job Details
               Performance Motorsports Inc was created from a vision of the Dover Corporation to define an umbrella company that contained the best of the best in the Automotive/Powersports worlds. This umbrella company would allow the separate companies to share engineering and technological resources to further expand market share and provide a superior product for our customers. The vision of combining such companies also allows each company to share in the financial backing of Dover, which will allow the companies to invest in the latest engineering and manufacturing resources. Wiseco Piston Inc. was the first acquisition by Dover in 1998 to begin building the framework for a larger company to dominate the performance Automotive/Powersports aftermarket. Wiseco Piston Inc. was founded in 1941 and is currently the #1 market leader in the USA for high performance pistons in the Powersports market (i.e. motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATVâ€™s and personal watercraft). Wiseco has since expanded its base and now offers much more than just pistons; which makes them a one stop shop for aftermarket performance parts in the Powersports arena. Wiseco has also begun to expand into the automotive market and continues to gain share on custom and off the shelf pistons for import and domestic automotive applications. Realizing the future opportunities in the European market, Wiseco and its management team pursued ProX Inter BV based in Amsterdam within six months of joining Dover. This would allow the future PMi Company to expand easily across the world and gain even more market share in a fast growing foreign market. ProX was founded in 1975 and brought its extensive line of cast pistons, connecting rod kits, bearings, and clutch baskets to the table. Their buying power and business knowledge of the US and European markets would make the ProX team a valuable asset to the future organization. Having laid the groundwork for the Powersports market, Wiseco and their new management team put in place by the Dover Corporation set out to further expand in the Automotive market and were presented with an opportunity to acquire JE Pistons based in Huntington Beach California. JE Pistons was founded in 1947 and is the #1 market leader in the USA for high performance forged pistons in the automotive aftermarket. JEâ€™s reputation in the automotive and racing industry made them a very valuable asset. This acquisition united the market leaders from Powersports and Automotive under one umbrella, providing a significant advantage over all competitors. Along with the acquisition of JE came the creation of Performance Motorsports Inc. in June of 1999. While each company within PMI will continue to operate independently, they are bound by a common strategy and an intense focus on serving customer needs in the performance aftermarket. The PMI story is not unique within Dover but is an excellent example of how a focused management group with a clear strategy has been able to build up a group of complementary businesses into a cohesive business unit providing an overall system solution to a growing customer base. K1 Technologies, which offers top quality Connecting Rods and Crankshafts at an affordable price was brought onboard in 2008. This arrangement will allow PMi to expand into the rotating assembly sector and provide a top quality alternative for our customers. The acquisition of Innovate Motorsports in 2009 announced our entry into electronic tuning market. Based in California, Innovate Motorsports develops and manufactures universal digital tuning tools for nearly all internal combustion engines. The companyâ€™s core technologies are patent-pending digital circuits that greatly improve upon current analog designs. With the growing trend of EFI in both the automotive and powersports markets, this venture will allow us to lead the way in tuning these state of the art engines.

The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issues over fifty separate license classifications to contractors. Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring Gary Lee Ellis



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring Gary Lee Ellis



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring Gary Lee Ellis



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Timeless Lee Jeans for Women
Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
