How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Johnson, Matthew R carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Johnson, Matthew R currently holds license JOHNSMR862MT (Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Johnson, Matthew R



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Johnson, Matthew R



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Overview

Speaking Engagements



Most of my work is with clients in all phases of real estate projects. I help negotiate construction contracts and resolve disputes when they arise. Once the building construction is complete, I represent real estate agents, buyers, and sellers in the purchase, sale, and leasing of residential and commercial properties.   
 
Individuals, businesses, and organizations of all sizes come to us for legal help with real estate matters. Those clients include public and private owners, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers. I am counsel to the New Hampshire Realtors Association and advise the organization and its members on risk management issues and current legal issues. My experience also involves loan workouts, foreclosures, and bankruptcies.
 
I believe strongly in being an active member of the community. I am the chair of the Manchester City Library Foundation and serve on the Board of the Associated Builders and Contractors NH/VT Chapter. Also outside of work, I enjoy tennis, skiing, and cooking. Time with my family is especially important to me. Until my kids outgrew my skill, I coached Bedford Athletic Club youth soccer teams, and you can watch me on stage most years in the Bedford Dance Center Nutcracker performance with my three girls. My family and I are members of Bedford Presbyterian Church.

  Johnson Matthey Piezo Products manufactures technical ceramics, focusing on the development and production of piezoceramic components and systems   




Piezoceramic actuators manufactured by Johnson Matthey






	Johnson Matthey has more than 40 years of know-how in the production and application of piezoceramic materials, and has produced more than 100 million units to date.

The piezo effect

	The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain crystalline materials to convert mechanical stress into electrical signals and vice versa.


Sensor effect – generates electrical tension by deforming the shape of the ceramic.
Actuator effect – changes the ceramic's shape, creating movements and forces, by receiving electrical tension.

Applications

	Piezoceramic sensors are used where something has to be measured or controlled, for example where signals or knocks have to be detected or counted. It is also possible to use piezoceramic sensors as energy harvesting generators for creating electrical tension.


	Piezoceramic actuators are used in applications that require relatively small movements and forces. Johnson Matthey supplies piezoceramic actuators for automotive applications, textiles manufacturing, medical devices and industrial products.


	Piezoceramic actuators can also be used to create ultrasonic waves for atomising fluids used in a variety of applications, including medical aerosols and cooling fluids.
