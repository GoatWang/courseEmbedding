979-779-3400 for seamless rain gutters and more!





Overview
Directions



Overview
Directions





 Your gutters are one of the
least-praised but most important parts of your home.  They
transfer rainwater from your roof and siding harmlessly to the
ground.  Without gutters, your foundation and landscaping
could be damaged by excess rainwater, your siding might be
strained, and you could find rot or mold around your doors and
windows.
Prevent this damage: call
Seamless Home Products, LLC, at 979-779-3400 to have customized
seamless gutters created and installed for your home.
Seamless Gutter
Systems
 Why should you choose seamless gutters?
It’s true that conventional gutters are better than no
gutters at all, but conventional gutters have built-in weak points
in the seams where the gutters are joined together.  Any one
of these can break to form a damaging leak.  But seamless
gutters are completely smooth all around your home; there are no
built-in weak spots where leaks can occur.  With the
unpredictable weather we can get here in Bryant and College
Station, TX, isn’t it better to be safe than
sorry?
You can’t choose a safer
company than Seamless Home Products.  Their business has been
in continuous operation for over thirty years, and they’ve
been under the current management for the past five.  They
make sure to only hire full-time employees (no picking up workers
the day a job is supposed to start), and altogether, these
employees have a combined thirty years experience. 
They’re a BBB Accredited Business with an A+ rating. 
And every job they do comes with a one-year warranty for the
installation.
Screened Porches and
More
 Seamless Home Products wants to do more
than just make sure your home is safe from the worst of the rain;
they want to make sure you can enjoy your outdoor spaces even in
inclement or buggy weather.  That’s why they provide
screened-in porches and insulated patio covers.  These
products can greatly increase the usability of your outdoor
spaces.
With them, you can have all your
friends over for a barbeque, even if it’s raining, or enjoy
time outdoors while protecting yourself and your family from
mosquitoes and other pests.
Call Today!
Today is the day you should
invest in seamless gutters for your home.  They’re
affordable, reliable, and come in a variety of colors and
styles.  Not only will your home be safer from the damaging
effects of rain, it’ll look great.  But none of this
will happen unless you call Seamless Home Products, LLC.  Call
979-779-3400 today, and enjoy a modern, worry-free gutter system
tomorrow.



Products & Services

and 6" half round), Gutter installation, Collector box

About


Our Philosophy
Founded in 2013, WholeMe was created by two women dedicated to developing nutrient-dense, delicious, convenient foods. Like many, their lives were busy and chaotic. WholeMe was created using real ingredients to fuel their active lifestyle. A real alternative to the preservative-filled, sugar-laden snacks that surround us.

 Our Story
WholeMe is the partnership of Krista Steinbach and Mary Kosir. Two smart, passionate women who realized the power that food has on their daily lives and want to make eating real, delicious food convenient and easy.
Earlier in 2014, we successfully launched a Kickstarter campaign and raised over $40,000.  Matt Jasper created an amazing video.  You can view it  here.


Mary Kosir
The Kosir family thought they were healthy. But when Mary’s husband was diagnosed with Type I diabetes, it was time to re-evaluate.
The Kosirs kicked it up a notch. They embraced a healthier lifestyle, entering races together and adopting a grain-free diet. It began working wonders – everyone felt better and had more energy throughout the day.
But Mary wanted a snack once in awhile – one that was whole food-based, healthy, grain-free, and truly tasty. After a few red wine-laced brainstorming sessions, some crazy recipe ideas, and late night baking sessions, DateMe was born.


Krista Steinbach
You wouldn’t think that one of the founders of a company devoid of grains and white sugar would be a pastry chef in a former life – but at WholeMe, we like the “wild” things. Prior to WholeMe, Krista owned and operated a bakeshop and was head pastry chef at a top restaurant in the country.
While she still appreciates the craft of all; she follows a whole foods-based diet that is constantly evolving. After all, life is not black and white, and is best enjoyed (in her opinion) finding the balance that is right for you individually.
Krista and Mary met lifting heavy weights at CrossFit St. Paul. After the debut of DateMe from Mary’s kitchen, it didn’t take long for Krista and Mary to join forces to bring WholeMe to fruition and never look back!

Our Food


WholeMe creates nutrient-dense, delicious, convenient foods. We offer an alternative to the current, preservative filled and sugar-laden snacks that surround us.

What We're Made Of
Healthy fats
Fats have been given a bad rap in the past. But we love fat at WholeMe! Not only is it a dense source of energy to fuel you for hours on end (vs. its carbohydrate friend—sugar—which will leave you crashing and burning soon after), it is also critical to many metabolic processes in the body that regulate hormones and brain function, to name a few.
The fat in our products come from nuts, seeds and organic coconut oil. These are super healthy fats and our favorite is coconut oil. This type of fat can be used immediately by the body for energy without having to be broken down, converted, and stored like other types of fats.
We use only real sweeteners
You won’t find any “high fructose” ingredients in our products. We believe in sweetening with real food – honey, dates, and vanilla, so you can enjoy the added vitamins and minerals from these foods.  When combined with healthy fats (which slows the absorption of carbs in the bloodstream, thus stabilizing blood sugar), our sweeteners provide a longer and steadier source of energy.
No preservatives
Do you really want to eat that bar that can sit on a shelf for years and taste the same as the day you bought it? Think about it. The only preservative we use is the refrigerator because real food is perishable. We believe in ingredients you can pronounce and trust. And that’s what you’ll find in all of our products. Short shelf life, long human life, right?!
No worries
All of our products are grain-free and gluten-free and many of our products are dairy-free and soy-free. By creating products without these common allergens, WholeMe is committed to creating universally healthier foods. For a complete list of ingredients in each product, visit our shop.

About


Our Philosophy
Founded in 2013, WholeMe was created by two women dedicated to developing nutrient-dense, delicious, convenient foods. Like many, their lives were busy and chaotic. WholeMe was created using real ingredients to fuel their active lifestyle. A real alternative to the preservative-filled, sugar-laden snacks that surround us.

 Our Story
WholeMe is the partnership of Krista Steinbach and Mary Kosir. Two smart, passionate women who realized the power that food has on their daily lives and want to make eating real, delicious food convenient and easy.
Earlier in 2014, we successfully launched a Kickstarter campaign and raised over $40,000.  Matt Jasper created an amazing video.  You can view it  here.


Mary Kosir
The Kosir family thought they were healthy. But when Mary’s husband was diagnosed with Type I diabetes, it was time to re-evaluate.
The Kosirs kicked it up a notch. They embraced a healthier lifestyle, entering races together and adopting a grain-free diet. It began working wonders – everyone felt better and had more energy throughout the day.
But Mary wanted a snack once in awhile – one that was whole food-based, healthy, grain-free, and truly tasty. After a few red wine-laced brainstorming sessions, some crazy recipe ideas, and late night baking sessions, DateMe was born.


Krista Steinbach
You wouldn’t think that one of the founders of a company devoid of grains and white sugar would be a pastry chef in a former life – but at WholeMe, we like the “wild” things. Prior to WholeMe, Krista owned and operated a bakeshop and was head pastry chef at a top restaurant in the country.
While she still appreciates the craft of all; she follows a whole foods-based diet that is constantly evolving. After all, life is not black and white, and is best enjoyed (in her opinion) finding the balance that is right for you individually.
Krista and Mary met lifting heavy weights at CrossFit St. Paul. After the debut of DateMe from Mary’s kitchen, it didn’t take long for Krista and Mary to join forces to bring WholeMe to fruition and never look back!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
