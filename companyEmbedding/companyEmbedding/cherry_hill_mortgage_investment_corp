Loan Type:

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Town House

Co-op



Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

There’s a mortgage product to meet almost any need
From first-time buyer programs to reverse mortgages to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), today’s lenders offer products that allow borrowers to:

Buy property with a low (or no) down payment
Build a house
Exchange home equity for cash
Purchase rental housing
Refinance to a better interest rate
Supplement monthly income
Renovate their residences











 



Types of mortgage programs
Consumers should discuss their options with mortgage lenders to come up with the program that best meets their needs. Home mortgages can be classified in several ways:

Fixed rate or adjustable rate
Conforming or jumbo loan amount
Government or conventional
Purchase or refinance
Prime or sub-prime
Traditional (forward) or reverse
Construction or permanent
First or second mortgage
















What to do before applying for a mortgage loan?
Once they have selected a program, borrowers should compare mortgage rates and terms. That’s easy to do online with sites like LendingTree.com. When comparing mortgage programs, consumers should get the same information from each lender. This includes interest rate, duration of interest rate (Does it adjust? When? By how much?), loan term (15 year, 30 year, etc.), lender fees and 3rd party charges, APR, features like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties, and mortgage insurance or funding fees.
It’s important when shopping for a mortgage to get all home loan quotes at approximately the same time. Mortgage interest rates change constantly, because they are affected by the prices of bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are bought and sold like stocks. Global economic news, Treasury auctions and decisions by the Federal Reserve can cause mortgage rates to move up and down very suddenly. Just as stock prices change all day long, so can mortgage rates. This means a quote from Lender A on Monday can’t reliably be compared to one from Lender B on Wednesday. LendingTree allows consumers to easily compare real-time quotes from competing mortgage lenders, helping them make informed choices and save money.

Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT is a company that owns, and in many cases, operates income-producing real estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Some REITs also engage in financing real estate. The shares of many REITs are publicly traded but this is not a requirement for qualification as a REIT.

To qualify as a REIT, a company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to its shareholders annually. A REIT is allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders from its corporate taxable income. Therefore, most REITs distribute at least 100 percent of their taxable income to their shareholders and thus owe no federal corporate tax. Taxes are paid by shareholders on the dividends they receive and any capital gains. Most states honor this federal treatment and also do not require REITs to pay state income tax. Like other businesses, but unlike partnerships, a REIT cannot pass any tax losses through to its investors.

About Us



About Us
Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (NYSE:CHMI) is a real estate finance company that acquires, invests in and manages a portfolio of excess mortgage servicing rights, agency residential mortgage backed securities and other residential mortgage assets.
We are externally managed by Cherry Hill Mortgage Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
Our Goal
Cherry Hill’s principal objective is to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividend distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to attain this objective by selectively constructing and actively managing a targeted portfolio of Excess MSRs, Agency RMBS and other cashflowing residential mortgage assets.
Our Corporate Structure
Cherry Hill has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. We generally are not subject to federal taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT.
Our Manager
Cherry Hill is externally managed and advised by Cherry Hill Mortgage Management, LLC (our "Manager" or "CHMM"). CHMM is responsible for our investment strategies and decisions and our day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors.

Investment Strategy
Targeted Investments
Hedging & Risk Management Strategy


Investment Strategy
We utilize an opportunistic strategy to seek to provide investors with attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns by:

 allocating a majority of our equity capital, on an unleveraged basis, to the acquisition of Excess Mortgage Servicing Rights (or MSRs) through flow purchases from or bulk purchases with mortgage servicers;
							 taking advantage of opportunities in the Agency RMBS market by acquiring Agency RMBS on a leveraged basis; 
							 over time, as the market for prime jumbo mortgage loans grows, taking advantage of opportunities in this market by purchasing these assets from, or potentially in partnership with, Freedom Mortgage; and
							 opportunistically mitigating our prepayment, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, credit risk by using recapture agreements and a variety of hedging instruments.
						
Our strategy is adaptable to changing market environments, subject to compliance with the income and other tests that we must satisfy to qualify as a REIT and maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. As a result, although we intend initially to focus on the acquisition and management of Excess MSR assets on an unleveraged basis and Agency RMBS on a leveraged basis, our acquisition and management decisions will depend on prevailing market conditions and our targeted asset classes may vary over time in response to market conditions.

Targeted Investments
Our asset acquisition strategy focuses on acquiring a diversified portfolio of residential mortgage assets that attempts to balance the risk and reward opportunities. We expect to allocate a majority of our equity, on an unleveraged basis, to the acquisition of Excess Mortgage Servicing Rights (or MSRs). We also intend to acquire Agency Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (or RMBSs) on a leveraged basis and, as the market for prime jumbo loans grows, we expect our portfolio to include this asset class as well. In addition, we may also invest opportunistically from time to time in other residential mortgage assets.
Hedging & Risk Management Strategy
We opportunistically manage our interest rate risk by using various hedging strategies. Subject to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT and maintaining our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may utilize certain derivative financial instruments and other hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk we expect to arise from our repurchase agreement financings associated with our Agency RMBS.
The interest rate hedging instruments that we use include interest rate swaps (floating-to-fixed, fixed-to-floating, or more complex swaps such as floating-to-inverse floating, callable or non-callable); CMOs; TBAs; U.S. treasury securities; swaptions, caps, floors and other derivatives on interest rates; futures and forward contracts; and options on any of the foregoing.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.00      Net Money Flow ($)  1,057    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

					Full Description



Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation, incorporated on October 31, 2012, is a residential real estate finance company. The Company is focused on acquiring, investing in and managing residential mortgage assets in the United States. Its principal objective is to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for its stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividend distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation. The Company focuses on attaining this objective, subject to market conditions and availability and terms of financing, by selectively constructing and managing a targeted portfolio of Servicing Related Assets, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), prime mortgage loans and other cashflowing residential mortgage assets. The Company operates its business through segments, including investments in RMBS; investments in Servicing Related Assets, and All Other. The Company's targeted asset classes include servicing related assets consisting of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and Excess MSRs; RMBS, including Agency RMBS, residential mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) (interest-only security (IO) and inverse IOs) and to-be-announced (TBA), and prime mortgage loans. The Company is externally managed by Cherry Hill Mortgage Management, LLC.The Company also may generate MSRs through the purchase of prime mortgage loans. Its RMBS strategy focuses primarily on the acquisition and ownership of Agency RMBS that are whole-pool, residential mortgage pass-through certificates. However, from time to time, the Company invests in CMOs, including IOs and inverse IOs. Its RMBS strategy includes selective investments in non-Agency RMBS, including government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) risk-sharing securities.

Loan Type:

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Potential for Mortgage Rates to Move Significantly Today, But Which Way?

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

There’s a mortgage product to meet almost any need
From first-time buyer programs to reverse mortgages to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), today’s lenders offer products that allow borrowers to:

Buy property with a low (or no) down payment
Build a house
Exchange home equity for cash
Purchase rental housing
Refinance to a better interest rate
Supplement monthly income
Renovate their residences











 



Types of mortgage programs
Consumers should discuss their options with mortgage lenders to come up with the program that best meets their needs. Home mortgages can be classified in several ways:

Fixed rate or adjustable rate
Conforming or jumbo loan amount
Government or conventional
Purchase or refinance
Prime or sub-prime
Traditional (forward) or reverse
Construction or permanent
First or second mortgage
















What to do before applying for a mortgage loan?
Once they have selected a program, borrowers should compare mortgage rates and terms. That’s easy to do online with sites like LendingTree.com. When comparing mortgage programs, consumers should get the same information from each lender. This includes interest rate, duration of interest rate (Does it adjust? When? By how much?), loan term (15 year, 30 year, etc.), lender fees and 3rd party charges, APR, features like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties, and mortgage insurance or funding fees.
It’s important when shopping for a mortgage to get all home loan quotes at approximately the same time. Mortgage interest rates change constantly, because they are affected by the prices of bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are bought and sold like stocks. Global economic news, Treasury auctions and decisions by the Federal Reserve can cause mortgage rates to move up and down very suddenly. Just as stock prices change all day long, so can mortgage rates. This means a quote from Lender A on Monday can’t reliably be compared to one from Lender B on Wednesday. LendingTree allows consumers to easily compare real-time quotes from competing mortgage lenders, helping them make informed choices and save money.

Quicken Loans Ranks Highest in Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction for Seventh Consecutive Year


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 10 Nov. 2016 — Overall satisfaction scores have increased year over year, but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study,SM released today.The study shows that 21% of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender, and 27% of first-time home buyers regret their choice. Among customers who regret their decision, there are two distinct situations.The first situation is customers having a poor experience (overall scores below 600 on a 1,000-point scale), which includes an above-average incidence of problems, lack of communication and unmet promises. While this group’s responses aren’t unexpected, they are often vocal about their displeasure, making an average of 9.0 negative comments, compared with the study average of 0.7.The second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high. This group tends to be very price-focused and frequently obtains multiple quotes. Among customers who regret their lender selection, 72% indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product. Their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons, such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm (e.g., checking account with direct deposit).“This ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear,” said Craig Martin, director of the mortgage practice at J.D. Power. “Like a lot of consumers, they are happy with a good deal, but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal. In the end, they may not fully understand exactly what they got, and the longer-term risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future.”One potential contributing factor to this condition could be TRID (TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure[1]).  Over the past two years, much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements, which became effective in October 2015. Lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction. While various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process, findings of the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study show little change in the perceived speed of the process. Improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions.“Whether it is a new regulation, shifting rates or new technology, lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change,” Martin said. “Regardless of what comes, if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers.”Following are some of the key findings in this year’s study:A higher percentage of customers in 2016 indicate their loan representative always called back when promised, compared with last year (85% vs. 81%, respectively), and their loan closed on the desired date (81% vs. 79%).Satisfaction is significantly higher among customers buying a home (840) than among those refinancing (821). In the 2014 and 2015 studies, the levels of satisfaction in these groups were nearly identical.Technology is becoming increasingly important, with 28% of customers indicating they completed their detailed application online, up from 22% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. Study RankingsQuicken Loans ranks highest in primary mortgage origination satisfaction for a seventh consecutive year, with a score of 869. Quicken Loans performs particularly well in the application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; and onboarding factors.CitiMortgage moves up three positions from fifth in 2015 to second this year, with a score of 851.  Ditech Financial, new to the study in 2016, ranks third with a score of 849.Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (+52 points) and Nationstar Mortgage (+50 points) post the most significant year-over-year improvements in overall satisfaction.Advice to ConsumersPlan ahead when researching mortgage options. Satisfaction among customers who wait until they find a home to look into mortgage options is 92 points lower than among those who look into mortgage options before their home search.Take the time to obtain more than one quote. Among the 32% of customers who received just one quote, overall satisfaction is 19 points lower than those who get multiple quotes. Satisfaction is 38 points lower among first-time buyers only getting one quote vs. those who get multiple quotes.Choose a lender based on their merits, not just price or affiliation. Customers who say they chose their lender primarily because of price/rate or based on the recommendation of a realtor/builder are significantly less satisfied than those whose choice is based on other reasons.About the StudyThe 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study measures customer satisfaction with the mortgage origination experience in six factors (listed alphabetically): application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; onboarding; and problem resolution. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.The study is based on responses from 5,182 customers who originated a new mortgage or refinanced within the past 12 months, and was fielded in July–August 2016.For more information about the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, visithttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-primary-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
