Piedmont Natural Gas, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Piedmont Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC, joins Williams Partners L.P.  and Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation  as a 24 percent equity participant in the joint venture, and will invest an estimated $180 million in the new project.Thomas E. Skains, Piedmont’s Chairman, President, and CEO commented on the Company’s involvement, “Piedmont’s equity participation in the Constitution Pipeline project aligns very well with our strategic focus on expanding our investments in complementary energy-related businesses as a means of enhancing shareholder value.”  Skains continued, “We are excited about making an investment in strategic pipeline infrastructure in the Marcellus supply basin that will transport clean, low cost natural gas supplies to premium East Coast markets and provide substantial benefits for both natural gas producers and consumers.  We are equally excited to be joining such strong joint venture partners as Williams Partners and Cabot Oil and Gas, as both are outstanding companies and widely respected in our industry.”An affiliate of Williams Partners will construct, operate, and maintain the new 30-inch, 121-mile long transmission pipeline that is being designed with sufficient capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day (a quantity of natural gas that can serve approximately 3 million homes) from established Marcellus production areas in Susquehanna County of northern Pennsylvania.   The pipeline will connect with the Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, New York and is already fully contracted with long-term commitments from established natural gas producers currently operating in Pennsylvania; Piedmont will not be a customer of Constitution Pipeline.  Williams Partners will maintain a 51 percent ownership share, Cabot Oil and Gas a 25 percent share, and Piedmont Natural Gas, through its wholly owned subsidiary, a 24 percent share in the pipeline venture.“Williams Partners enjoys a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship with Piedmont as a customer on our Transco pipeline system and as a joint venture partner in existing pipeline and storage infrastructure projects in North Carolina. We are delighted to expand that relationship with Piedmont as a new partner in the Constitution Pipeline,” said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners.  “Constitution is a key component of the Susquehanna Supply Hub that Williams Partners is expanding to connect Marcellus Shale producers like Cabot and Southwestern Energy with the highest-value markets.“The Constitution Pipeline is a great example of the kind of leadership and investment –from energy-infrastructure providers like Williams Partners, utilities like Piedmont and producers like Cabot – that we believe is key to building the foundation our nation needs to realize the full benefits of the new abundance of long-lived, clean-burning natural gas supplies in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale and elsewhere in North America.”The Constitution Pipeline project was first announced in February 2012 by Williams Partners and Cabot Oil and Gas. Construction of the new pipeline is expected to begin in April 2014 with an in-service date of March 2015. Constitution Pipeline is currently in the pre-filing process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the federal agency charged with the regulation of interstate pipelines.  Constitution Pipeline plans to file a formal certificate application with the FERC in the spring of 2013.  More information about the Constitution Pipeline project can be found at www.constitutionpipeline.com.Read More: http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/13/4981407/piedmont-natural-gas-announces.htmlReceive New Posts via Email  Email Address         CategoriesAC MitigationAllentownAnodesBrand Energy & InfrastrucureBridgesCanadaCanister AnodescareersCathodic ProtectionClose Interval SurveysCommunityConcreteCorrosionCorrosion Industry EventsCP MastersDelawareDoDDOTDoylestownFloridaGashorizontal directional drillingHoustonIndiaInfrastructureJeff Didaslinear anodesMarcellusMarineMATCORMixed Metal OxideNACENatural GasNewsNuclearOffshoreOhioOilOil SandsPennsylvaniaPhiladelphiaPipelinePipeline IntegrityPipingPower PlantRefineryRegulationSafetySan BrunoShaleStorage TanksTexasTransportationUncategorizedUnited Arab EmiratesUticaUtilitiesWWIIArchivesJune 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017December 2016November 2016October 2016September 2016July 2016May 2016April 2016February 2016November 2015August 2015July 2015June 2015May 2015April 2015March 2015January 2015December 2014November 2014September 2014August 2014July 2014June 2014May 2014April 2014March 2014February 2014January 2014December 2013November 2013October 2013September 2013August 2013July 2013June 2013May 2013April 2013March 2013February 2013January 2013December 2012November 2012October 2012September 2012August 2012July 2012June 2012May 2012April 2012March 2012February 2012January 2012December 2011November 2011October 2011September 2011August 2011July 2011June 2011TagsAging Infrastructure Alaska Alberta BP Bridge Bridges Calgary California Canada cars Cathodic Protection Concrete Corrosion Drinking Water Enbridge Energy engineering Environment Gas infrastructure Keystone XL Marcellus Shale MATCOR NACE Natural Gas NTSB Nuclear Ohio Oil oilsands PG&E PHMSA Pipeline Pipeline Explosion Pipeline Integrity Pipeline Safety Regulations Safety San Bruno TransCanada Transportation travel UK Utilities Washington DC   all services     all products       Follow Us      ©  MATCOR, Inc.  |  Privacy Policy  |  EU - US Privacy Shield
