Todd Asset Management believes Price/ Intrinsic Value ("P/IV") is the most effective fundamental calculation to determine the true valuation of a stock. We believe investing in stocks with attractive valuation, improving fundamentals, and market acceptance of those characteristics increases the probability of outperformance. Combining them in a comprehensive, disciplined process with risk controls should result in a portfolio that consistently outperforms the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 Value over full market cycles.




Screening Process
Screening is a fundamentals-based, bottom-up process that is formalized in the combination of the firm's P/IV philosophy and proprietary Multi-Factor Ranking Model. Fundamental research, using corporate financial reports, Internet sites, quantitative evaluations, Wall Street research and government reports, is a vital and ongoing part of the process.

The Large Cap Intrinsic Value strategy is bottom-up in nature. The screening process starts with a universe of 4,500 domestic stocks which is narrowed to approximately 1,300 that have a market cap >$1 billion and an internal minimum quality rating of B-. We then identify a universe of attractively priced stocks using our Price/Intrinsic Value calculation; generally this universe is the least expensive third. 

Following the P/IV screening, we rank the available universe of about 250 stocks according to our proprietary Multi-Factor Ranking Model. A stock must have an attractive P/IV to be considered for our portfolio, but we also examine several additional factors. The process combines:


Valuation: P/IV and Trailing 12-month P/E
Fundamental Strength: EPS Revisions, Momentum and Share Repurchase
Market Recognition: Relative Strength and Accumulation/Distribution


The Multi-Factor Ranking Model assigns each stock a composite ranking score that reflects in a single number all of the factors above that we believe are most critical to identifying a stock's true future potential. The composite scores allow stocks to be accurately compared, regardless of sector. 

Before finalizing a portfolio, we verify each of the model inputs with a thorough fundamental review of each stock. We examine normal earnings to determine if they are appropriate, depending on the cyclical nature of the company. The long-term growth rate is scrutinized and compared with competitors and sustainable IRR growth rates, while keeping in mind the company's products and market placement. We review the internal quality rating to make sure it appropriately illustrates the type of risk/reward premium a stock needs for our valuation calculation. We also evaluate the company's fundamental outlook to assure there is an investment rationale for inclusion in the portfolio. Then, we determine whether the stock is being accumulated or distributed in the marketplace by viewing its relative strength and upside/downside volume. Finally, a stock must have an identifiable fundamental prospect for growth that would cause an increase in its valuation. After considering these factors and validating our model inputs, we assemble a portfolio by selecting what we believe are the most attractive stocks that offer the largest potential upside, highest quality, and maximum diversification for our clients.

The time-valued judgement and nearly 30 years of average industry experience of our portfolio managers focuses the inputs of our process with guidance as to which market conditions and research carry more or less importance. While holdings in the portfolio are formally reviewed by our portfolio managers each week, informal discussions take place almost daily and changes are made as needed.




Portfolio Construction Methodology
 The Large Cap Intrinsic Value portfolio holds on average 40-60 stocks balanced across industry sectors. The S&P 500 serves as the foundation for all sector decisions; sector weightings may not exceed the comparable S&P 500 sector weightings by ±10%. All major sectors of the S&P 500 are represented, but we may choose not to participate in sectors with weightings less than 3%. We do not employ any type of derivative strategies.

Most of the stocks in the portfolio are assigned a weighting of 1% to 3%. Occasionally, a stock is given a higher weighting if we have a great deal of conviction about its near term outlook. Sectors with the larger number of holdings will generally contain stocks with 1% to 2% weightings while sectors with fewer holdings will contain stocks with 2% to 3% weightings. Stocks with a stronger track record and ones we have used successfully before may also warrant a larger weighting, while new names may start out at 1%. The largest holding may be 3% at initial cost, and 5% at market. This strategy can be managed according to client investment guidelines, and can be measured against the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000 Value.





Risk Management
An experienced portfolio management team, sharing a common set of core beliefs and having the ability to recognize the underlying drivers for growth and value in individual stocks, are the centerpiece of our strategies. We couple this with buy and sell disciplines based on valuation and fundamentals for all of our strategies to limit the risks inherent in stock selection. Approximately 35% of the portfolio’s risk is controlled by the P/IV factor; the remaining 65% is controlled through diversification and sector decision rules. 

                                Our buy-side risk control measures include:
                                
Attractive P/IV
High-quality, large-cap portfolio
Broadly diversified portfolio of 40-60 stocks avoids single issue risk
Economic sector guidelines
Maximum issue weightings of 3% at cost and 5% at market
Multi-factor composite rankings that help us avoid value traps


Together, these measures are designed to support our underlying discipline of buying companies that are attractively valued, have improving fundamentals and have market acceptance of those factors to generate outperformance. 

In addition to identifying attractive buy opportunities, our multi-factor ranking is designed to identify weakening holdings through a declining multi-factor composite ranking score, so we diligently monitor these scores. We have found that stocks with high intrinsic value tend to be more volatile and underperform the market in subsequent periods, and we adjust the portfolio accordingly. 

Our sell discipline is also a vital risk control measure. There are two levels of urgency for selling that can best be described as discretionary and mandatory:


A stock is reviewed for potential sale or position reduction when its P/IV is greater than 1.3x the S&P 500, the multi-factor composite ranking falls below the midpoint of 8 or the fundamentals of a company/industry are perceived to have weakened.  
A stock is a mandatory sale when its P/IV exceeds 1.5x the S&P 500 or the multi-factor composite ranking falls below 6. A stock is also sold immediately if a structural negative is identified or if we become concerned about the integrity of a company's accounting.

Approximately 35% of the portfolio's risk is controlled by the P/IV factor; the remaining 65% is controlled through diversification and sector decision rules.

                                Our buy-side risk control measures include:
                                
Attractive P/IV
High-quality, large-cap portfolio
Broadly diversified portfolio of 65-85 stocks avoids single issue risk
Economic sector and region diversification
Maximum issue weightings of 2% at cost and 3% at market
Multi-factor composite rankings that help us avoid value traps


Together, these measures are designed to support our underlying discipline of buying large-cap, high-quality companies that are attractively valued, have improving fundamentals and have market acceptance of those factors to generate outperformance. 

In addition to identifying attractive buy opportunities, our multi-factor ranking is designed to identify weakening holdings through a declining multi-factor composite ranking score, so we diligently monitor these scores. We have found that stocks with high intrinsic value tend to be more volatile and underperform the market in subsequent periods and we adjust the portfolio accordingly.

Our sell discipline is also a vital risk control measure. There are two levels of urgency for selling that can best be described as discretionary and mandatory:


A stock is reviewed for potential sale or position reduction when its P/IV is greater than 1.3x the MSCI ACWI-ex US, the multi-factor composite ranking falls below the midpoint of 8 or the fundamentals of a company/industry are perceived to have weakened.   
A stock is a mandatory sale when its P/IV exceeds 1.5x the MSCI ACWI ex-US or the multi-factor composite ranking falls below 6. A stock is also sold immediately if a structural negative is identified or if we become concerned about the integrity of a company's accounting.

                        101 South 5th St.
                        Suite 3100
                        Louisville, KY 40202
 


Todd Asset Management LLC was founded in 1998; however, its predecessor firms date back to 1967 when Bosworth Todd founded the Todd-Boston Company. 
In 1986, responding to changing markets and frustration with the static nature of standard value practices, the value products adopted its unique methodology using intrinsic value to identify a stock's true underlying value.
Today, with nearly 30 years of experience with the intrinsic value methodology, Todd Asset Management continues to believe Price/Intrinsic Value ("P/IV") is still the most effective method for determining the relative attractiveness of one stock versus another, regardless of economic sector.
P/IV Provides the Foundation for Five Large Cap Strategies:

Domestic Large Cap Intrinsic Value
Domestic Intrinsic Value Opportunity
International Intrinsic Value
Global Intrinsic Value Equity Income
International Intrinsic Value Opportunity

Combining P/IV with a Fundamentals-Based, Proprietary Multi-Factor Ranking Model:
P/IV is the foundation for each of our five strategies, but the process has evolved to include a fundamentals-based, proprietary Multi-Factor Ranking Model. We believe investing in stocks with attractive valuations, that also possess fundamental strength and market acceptance, increases the probability of alpha generation over the short and long term. 
Generally, our proprietary model provides a composite ranking by separately scoring the fundamentals relevant to a particular strategy based on inputs that are individually validated by our portfolio management team. The cornerstone of the process, P/IV, is double weighted. Since the composite ranking allows securities to be compared across sectors and regions based on their fundamentals, we are able to both build and monitor portfolios with this process.
Success Measured by Client Satisfaction:
We know that client satisfaction is the ultimate measure of a firm's success. Todd Asset Management strives to diligently execute our process each and every day.
Todd Asset Management expects to continue its tradition of utilizing the P/IV methodology and Multi-Factor Ranking Model to focus on large cap stocks worldwide to meet client needs for high conviction, alpha generating strategies.

*Annualized Total Returns. Please refer to the Performance Disclosure at the bottom of this page for futher information.



           The  LCIV  posted a  gain of 5.08%  (gross  of  fees)  in  the  quarter,  slightly  trailing  S&P 500 and Russell 1000 Value  returns of  5.24%  and  5.10% respectively  for the quarter.
           Year to date  and over the trailing year the LCIV is comfortably ahead of both indexes. 
          

          With the S&P gaining  a little  more than 7% year to date, we see a number of points investors should  be 
          aware of, including;
          

              The range of YTD  returns  by S&P 500 sector are as follows; Utilities  +18%, Energy +13%, Healthcare +11%, Info Technology  +9%, Materials +9%, Consumer Staples +5%, Financials 
              +5%, Industrial  + 4%, Telecom +4%, and Consumer Discretionary +1%.
            

              Range of YTD total returns  by asset class are  S&P  500  up 7.1%, S&P Midcap up 7.5%, S&P Smallcap up 3.2%, Russell 1000 Value +8.2%, Russell 2000 up 3.2%, and Barclays AGG ETF +3.7%.
            

              Profit taking in  the Consumer Discretionary and Industrial   stocks has been  one of the biggest drivers of performance in domestic markets, as investors saw harsh weather slow the economy.
            

              Rotation into  Utilities  and Energy defined the quarter. Healthcare also performed well as takeovers and safety spurred interest.  Geopolitical  uncertainty (think Ukraine and Iraq) has 
              caused oil  to rise, helping  energy shares.
            

              The Fed continues to taper, yet volatility has declined and many banks/capital markets players are suffering.
            

              Mergers and Acquisitions have surged, especially in Health Care, Technology and Media. Most are occurring close to our calculated intrinsic value.
            


          We are pleased with the performance of the strategy because even being underweighted in the sectors that have performed best, we are still  performing  well.  While  the Fed has been tapering their bond purchases, 
          the market has been rewarding the traditional  investment disciplines   based on valuations, fundamental and technical disciplines  and not simply  bidding  up  high beta stocks.
          

          We present our customary charts on what factors have  been  helping or hindering  performance for US stocks below.  While Beta was rewarded over the past year, it has shifted to the underperformers  in the 
          most recent quarter. Valuations favoring cash flow, returns to shareholders and a ccounting book value have helped performance over the past quarter,  along  with certain  momentum  measures. Most  other 
          factors that we consider attractive tended to detract from returns during the quarter, perhaps as a result of the extraordinary actions the ECB and Bank of Japan are undertaking. 
          







Chart 1 & 2


            Compared  to  the  S&P  500  during  the  quarter,  stock  selection  helped  our  performance  while  sector allocation  detracted. The net result was to slightly underperform the index  during the quarter. Our best 
            contributors  on  stock  selection  were  the  Consumer  Staples  and  Industrials.  Specific stocks that helped were Altria and Walgreens in the  Consumer Staples sector and United Rentals and Illinois Tool Works in 
            the  Industrials.   The  areas  that  cost  us  the  most  in  stock  selection  were  Financials  and  Materials. Specifically,  Bank  of  America  and  JP  Morgan  Chase   as  well  as CF Industries were laggards.  We did 
            remove  Bank  of  America  from  the  portfolio  during  the  quarter.   On  our  sector  weights,  we  were overweighted  the  Industrials,  Financials  and  Consumer  Discretionary  compared  to  the  S&P  500  and 
            underweighted the Staples, Energy and Materials sectors. Positioning in the Energy and Financial sectors cost us performance versus the S&P 500. 
          

            Compared  to  the  Russell  1000  Value,  stock  selection  cost us a modest amount, while sector weightings helped a bit.  Stock selections in the Consumer Discretionary and Technology sectors detracted  from 
            portfolio performance. Whirlpool and Macys were the laggards in Discretionary, while EMC and Oracle lagged the Tech group. Our choices in the Consumer Staples and Industrials helped our performance, and 
            the leaders and laggards are noted above. 
          

            Our  best  performing  stocks  were  Conoco  Phillips,  Intel,  Apple,  Covidien  and  Gannett  Company.  The laggards  were  Bank of America, Express Scripts, Whirlpool, JP Morgan and CF Industries.  Among the 
            leaders,  Covidien  was  the  beneficiary  of  a  takeover  bid  by  Medtronic,  while  Intel  and  Apple  both  are benefitting from  better expectations on technology device sales.  We have booked the profit and sold the
            Covidien shares.  They are both seeing upward revisions to estimates. Conoco Phillips is benefitting from better E&P results. Gannett is benefitting from higher operating earnings resulting from the acquisition of 
            AH Belo's broadcasting business. Bank of America and JP Morgan have both suffered from continuing concerns  about  government  actions  stemming  from  the  financial  crisis.   Express  Scripts  declined  after 
            weaker  results  in  the  first  quarter  prompted  a  reduction  in  estimates.   Whirlpool  saw  a  weaker  thanexpected Q1 as a result of the bad weather and CF weakened as commodity prices declined. 
          






          Our Multi -factor model continues to highlight the more economically sensitive sectors as attractive at this juncture. Capital spending  is firming up as we begin to see expenditures on technology  improving. 
          Additionally, we view the recent increase in mergers as a way for companies to increase capacity without having  to  resort  to  the  vagaries  of  actually  building  factories. This  could  be  a  precursor  to  increasing 
          demand  for  productive  capacity,  and  it  certainly  indicates  a  newfound  confidence  among  management teams.
          

Interesting charts from the US that we saw this quarter


          We  can  go  into  chapter  and  verse  about  the  quarter,  the  negative  GDP,  the  geopolitical  crises  or  any number of other items about recent market action, but the most important chart to look at is the rolling ten 
          year market returns.
          


Chart 3



Chart 4



Chart 5



Chart 6


            Charts  like  the  timeline  above  are  always  useful,  in  our  opinion.   Since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the market has reached new highs despite several notable economic and geopolitical headwinds. We thought 
            some pause was likely after the first quarter as   midterm elections are coming up in the US. As we look forward,  we  cannot  rule  out  a  pause,  but  having  shrugged  off  a  Russian  Invasion  of  the  Ukraine,  the 
            dissolution of Iraq as we know it and a hugely negative print on GDP  growth;  we're hard pressed to say what  is  likely  to  cause  this market to backtrack.  We believe the combination of a recovery in economic 
            growth and continued low short term rates in the US indicates the path of least resistance is still up for the S&P 500.

          appreciation. This goal is pursued by investing in a diversified portfolio of equity securities that TAM believes are trading at a discount to their 
          intrinsic value.

          the growth products founded under VAM, and changed its name to Todd Asset Management LLC. The firm continues to offer the sa me products 
          and strategies managed by the same individuals and process founded under TIA

          Value Index as the benchmark. Prior to April 1, 2010, this composite was known as the Relative Value Equity Composite; no changes in the 
          strategy were made in conjunction with the name change. All fee-paying, fully discretionary portfolios under our management are included in a 
          composite. Accounts are eligible for inclusion in the composite at the beginning of the first calendar quarter after the month of initial fund ing
