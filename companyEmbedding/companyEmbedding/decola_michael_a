1.      What
was your first job?  
I actually began working as a caddie at 14. I knew nothing about
golf, and as a kid, I didn’t get out enough to justify the long drive for my
mom to take me to the golf course. After about a month, I got a job as a busboy
at a pretty nice restaurant near my home.

 

2.      What’s
the best advice you have ever received?
Hard work always pays off.

 

3.      When
and where do you do your best thinking?  
In the early mornings, while on bike rides, runs or in my den.

 

4.      What’s
your favorite book of all time — about business or otherwise? 
Foundation
by Isaac Asimov

 

5.      What’s
your motto? 
Treat everyone with respect and dignity.

 

6.      What
characteristics do you look for in people? 

Integrity and drive.

 

7.      How do
you measure success?  
Through measurable impact — by leaving things better than I found
them.

 

8.      Which
natural talent would you most like to have? Why? 
I’d like to be a better guitarist. I was an aspiring musician when
I was younger, but clearly didn’t have the talent to make it a career (thank
God).

 

9.      What
do you consider your greatest achievements? 
Marrying way over my head and raising two phenomenal kids.

 

10.  What
music are you listening to lately? 
Mostly country, but my last download was “Uptown Funk.”

 

11.  What
do you do to manage your energy and remain balanced? 
I have a fairly disciplined workout schedule that both builds my
stamina and provides the mental downtime I need to recharge. My various civic
activities help me maintain focus on the need to improve the world, not just
HBM Holdings. I stay connected with my friends and family almost constantly,
thanks to technology. I have no delusions about being balanced. I’m not, and I
have a very understanding family.

 

12.  What
are your favorite causes? 
Darden and the United Way. Darden changed my life, and the United
Way changes the lives of millions of others. It's an honor to be able to give
some of myself to both institutions.

 

13.  What’s
your favorite food and beverage? 
Pizza and Diet Pepsi. I need portion control for both.

 

14.  What’s
next? 
Continuing to execute our new strategy at HBM Holdings and
preparing to transition the organization to a new leader. We’re simultaneously
transitioning the board from a generational standpoint. It’s very exciting and
challenging.

 

15.  Which
class at Darden impacted you the most? 
“Managing Change.”

 

16.  Which
Darden professor influenced you the most? 

John Colley, and he still does.

 

17.  What
was your favorite experience returning to Darden as a classroom speaker? 
I like getting input from current students about issues facing HBM
Holdings.

 

18.  What
do you most enjoy about being a class agent? 
I appreciate the opportunity to stay in touch with my classmates
and help them understand how they can contribute to Darden’s future.

 

19.  You’re
chair of the Centennial PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club in 2018. How
is the planning going? 
We are actually just getting started, but it is an amazing honor
for me and Bellerive. We intend on breaking every standing record for host
clubs, so it will be great.

 

20.  How
has your Darden MBA degree helped you with HBM’s strategy to provide strategic
expertise to its portfolio companies?  
In some ways, it is like being back in school. We are
investigating new markets and new industries every week. We have to learn
quickly and ask the management team the tough questions about where they want
to go and how to get there. It is very similar to working through a case.

ST. LOUIS (March 17, 2016)  ̶  Mike DeCola, chief executive officer of HBM Holdings, has been named the 2016-2017 chair of the board of directors for United Way of Greater St. Louis. DeCola most recently served as the 2014 campaign co-chair for United Way and has led the way in generosity as a strong United Way supporter for 12 years. DeCola succeeds W. Stephen Maritz, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Maritz Inc., who held the chair position for the past two years.
DeCola has served as the 2014 United Way campaign co-chair, raising more than $73 million to help people in our region, and he has been a United Way board of directors and executive committee member since 2015.
“United Way is an outstanding organization at the forefront of philanthropic giving and continues to focus on its mission to help people in our region live their best possible lives,” DeCola said. “It’s an honor to work alongside some of the most talented and generous leaders in the St. Louis region to continue helping United Way excel in excellent service to the community. I am eager to navigate the road ahead and be involved in a new aspect of United Way’s work as board chair.”
“It has been fantastic seeing Mike’s leadership in his own company and in the United Way campaign,” said Orvin Kimbrough, president and CEO of United Way of Greater St. Louis. “His passion for helping people shines through everything he does. I am excited for his leadership, innovation and enthusiasm for our region and to see where he will take us as we continue to help local people.”
