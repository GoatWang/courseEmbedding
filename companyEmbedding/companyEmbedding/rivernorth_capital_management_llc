Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a
                    guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance
                    quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your
                    shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You can obtain
                    performance data current to the most recent month end by calling (888) 848-7569. Total return
                    measures net investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments. All
                    performance shown assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions.

                    (RNHIX) and 1.60% (RNOTX) and only includes the direct expenses paid by shareholders from their
                    investment. The total expense ratio as disclosed in the Fund's prospectus dated 1.28.2017 is 2.56%
                    (RNCIX), 2.81% (RNCOX), 1.49% (RNSIX), 1.74% (RNDLX), 1.44% (RNHIX)

                    funds.
The adviser has contractually agreed to defer the collection of fees and/or
                    reimburse expenses, but only to the extent necessary to limit Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses
                    (excluding brokerage fees and commissions; borrowing costs, such as (a) interest and (b)
                    dividends on securities sold short; taxes; indirect expenses incurred by the Underlying Funds in
                    which the Fund invests; and extraordinary expenses) to  1.35% (RNHIX)

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective of current income and overall total return by allocating among two principal investment strategies: the Tactical Closed-End Fund Income Strategy, managed by RiverNorth, and the Opportunistic Income Strategy, managed by DoubleLine.  The Fund, as described in its prospectus, has flexibility to strategically allocate between these two strategies in order to select the best relative opportunities in different market environments. The Fund will provide diversification across numerous fixed income asset classes with careful regard to balancing credit and interest rate risk.

An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. For more information, please read the prospectus, call your financial professional or call 1-855-830-1222.
The fund is a closed-end fund and closed-end funds do not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market's value. 
Important Information and Risk Factors
Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in any investment company security involves risk, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before investing in the Common Shares, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in the prospectus.

Fund Update: RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP)
2.21.2017 - CIO Patrick Galley provides an update on RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP).





Fund Update: RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP)
11.10.2016 - CIO Patrick Galley provides an update on RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP).








Investment Objective & Philosophy
RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") seeks to provide current income and overall total return.
While RiverNorth Capital Management, LLC ("RiverNorth") believes markets are generally efficient, closed-end funds offer a unique structure whereby investors can purchase a diversified fund and potentially generate additional return through the change in the relationship between the closed-end fund's market price and Net Asset Value (NAV)1. RiverNorth also believes combining a closed-end fund strategy with a proven fixed income manager such as DoubleLine Capital LP ("DoubleLine®") provides an attractive investment vehicle for investors.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.



Investment Strategy
RiverNorth allocates the Fund's assets among two principal strategies: Tactical Closed-End Fund Income Strategy (managed by RiverNorth) and Opportunistic Income Strategy (managed by DoubleLine).



* Investments may include securities that have a rating that is below investment grade, including "high yield" securities. 
Target portfolio asset allocations are estimates made by the adviser and subject to change.
High yield bonds are subject to interest rate risk. If rates increase, the value generally declines.



Investment Rationale
RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. is a multi-manager closed-end fund that opportunistically invests in fixed income securities and tactically invests in closed-end funds in order to potentially provide:

Access to a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities and closed-end funds representing a wide array of underlying asset classes
Value from investments in both the closed-end fund and fixed income markets
Use of leverage in order to enhance current income and capitalize at times on market dislocations

The Fund also provides:

Contingent conversion by shareholder vote to open-end in 5 years
Active portfolio management by RiverNorth & DoubleLine, two award-winning
                    managers in their respective disciplines, who have worked together since 2010

Leverage is a speculative technique that exposes a closed-end fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not used. The use of leverage may cause greater volatility in the level of a closed-end fund's NAV, market price and distributions on its common shares. Leverage will also result in higher fees to the closed-end fund manager because the amount of assets under management will be included in the Fund's managed assets. There can be no assurance that a closed-end fund will use leverage or that its leveraging strategy will be successful during any period in which it is employed.

Therefore, before investing in the Common Shares, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in the prospectus.
More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not ensure a
            profit or guarantee against loss.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. For more information, please read the prospectus, call your financial professional or call 800.617.0004.
The fund is a closed-end fund and closed-end funds do not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market's value.

3 Estimated Duration: Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income
                investment to a change in interest rates. Duration is expressed as a number of years. Duration is estimated by
                the adviser based on certain assumptions from third-party data and is subject to change.
