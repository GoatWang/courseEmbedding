(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited)  Year ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2015 We expect revenue and expenses to increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties and to decrease to the extent that we dispose of properties. The following table sets forth the results of our operations (in thousands):   Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Revenues: Rental income $ 52,928 $ 14,661 Total revenues 52,928 14,661 Expenses: Rental operating 25,467 8,235 Acquisition costs 9,079 9,136 Management fees 9,235 2,435 General and administrative 9,272 3,690 Loss on disposal of assets 2,516 1,680 Depreciation and amortization expense 30,964 9,270 Total expenses 86,533 34,446 Loss before other income (expense) (33,605 ) (19,785 ) Other income (expense): Interest income 209 129 Insurance proceeds in excess of cost basis 185 - Interest expense (10,950 ) (2,516 ) Net loss $ (44,161 ) $ (22,172 )  Revenues: Rental income increased by $38.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of six additional properties since December 31, 2015, as well as the implementation of our investment strategy to increase monthly rental income and occupancy rates after renovating and stabilizing operations and was primarily comprised of:   Increase in Effective Monthly Revenue Rental Increase (in per Unit (in Multifamily Community thousands) Change in Occupancy % dollars) Adair off Addison $ 318 11.2 % 104 Overton Trails Apartment Homes 545 2.2 % 167 Uptown Buckhead 736 6.0 % 37 Crosstown at Chapel Hill 1,897 1.2 % 162 The Brookwood 2,164 3.3 % 10 Adair off Addison Apartment Homes 1,720 (2.5 )% 184 Montclair 2,194 (10.1 )% 532 1000 Spalding Crossing 2,576 (2.8 )% 64 Grand Reserve 5,451 (2.8 )% 240 Verdant Apartment Homes 4,051 (5.6 )% 279 Properties acquired in 2016 16,615 N/A N/A $ 38,267  Expenses: Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were from the ongoing operations of our business and the ownership of 16 operating properties and increased as a result of the acquisition of six additional properties since December 31, 2015.   Properties owned during both periods All other Total Depreciation $ 10,479 $ 6,271 $ 16,750 Amortization of intangibles (268 ) 5,212 4,944 $ 10,211 $ 11,483 $ 21,694  The overall increase in depreciation expense for properties owned both periods is due to the additional $31.3 million in capital improvements made during 2016 in accordance with our planned renovations.  anticipates that certain properties will serve as collateral for the debt we incur to acquire those particular properties and that we will seek to obtain nonrecourse financing for the acquisition of the properties. However, there is no guarantee that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining financing arrangements on a property-by-property basis and that the loans would be nonrecourse to us. Finally, we may also obtain seller financing with respect to specific assets that we acquire.   Capital deployed during the year ended Remaining capital December 31, 2016 budgeted Overton Trails Apartment Homes $ 2,131 $ 2,267 Uptown Buckhead 2,597 558 Crosstown at Chapel Hill 2,846 4,227 The Brookwood 3,946 2,995 Adair off Addison Apartment Homes 2,389 7,203 1000 Spalding Crossing 2,399 2,742 Grand Reserve 3,483 4,482 Verdant Apartment Homes 2,335 3,096 Arcadia Apartment Homes 3,514 5,261 Riverlodge 2,467 9,544 All other properties 3,227 29,363 $ 31,334 $ 71,738  Common Stock As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of 59,160,177 shares of $0.01 par value common stock outstanding, including the Advisor's additional purchase of 117,778 shares of common stock for $1.1 million, as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Shares Issued Gross Proceeds Shares issued through initial public offering 55,791,297 $ 556,197 Shares issued through stock distributions 246,365 - Shares issued through distribution reinvestment plan 3,280,313 29,247 Advisor's initial investment, net of 5,000 share conversion 15,000 150 Total shares redeemed and retired (172,798 ) (1,497 ) Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016 59,160,177 $ 584,097  Debt The following table presents a summary of our mortgage notes payable, net (in thousands): December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Deferred Deferred Outstanding Financing Costs, Carrying Outstanding Financing Costs, Carrying Collateral borrowings Premium, net net Value borrowings Premium, net net Value Overton Trails Apartment Homes $ 31,075 $ - $ (344 ) $ 30,731 $ 31,075 $ - $ (382 ) $ 30,693 Uptown Buckhead 20,200 - (284 ) 19,916 20,200 - (320 ) 19,880 Crosstown at Chapel Hill 32,000 - (373 ) 31,627 32,000 - (491 ) 31,509 The Brookwood - Key Bank 18,247 508 (239 ) 18,516 18,603 621 (293 ) 18,931 The Brookwood - Capital One 2,699 39 (41 ) 2,697 2,739 47 (50 ) 2,736 Adair off Addison and Adair off Addison Apartment Homes 25,500 - (464 ) 25,036 25,500 - (583 ) 24,917 1000 Spalding Crossing 24,600 - (289 ) 24,311 24,600 - (349 ) 24,251 Riverlodge 28,292 - (393 ) 27,899 - - - - Verdant Apartment Homes 37,300 - (345 ) 36,955 - - - - Arcadia Apartment Homes 40,200 - (379 ) 39,821 - - - - Grand Reserve 42,395 - (446 ) 41,949 - - - - Montclair Terrace 21,083 - (345 ) 20,738 - - - - Breckenridge 52,975 - (697 ) 52,278 - - - - Santa Rosa 45,700 - (643 ) 45,057 - - - - Windbrooke Crossing 38,320 - (490 ) 37,830 - - - - $ 460,586 $ 547 $ (5,772 ) $ 455,361 $ 154,717 $ 668 $ (2,468 ) $ 152,917  The following table presents additional information about our mortgage notes payable, net (in thousands, except percentages):   Annual Average Maturity Margin over Interest Monthly Debt Average Date LIBOR Rate Service Monthly Escrow Overton Trails Apartment Homes 1/1/2025 1.91 % 2.68 % $ 118 $ 155 (1) (3) (5) Uptown Buckhead 7/1/2025 2.22 % 2.99 % $ 78 $ 70 (1) (3) (5) Crosstown at Chapel Hill 7/10/2020 1.70 % 2.47 % $ 95 $ - (1) (4) (5) The Brookwood - Key Bank 11/1/2021 - 4.73 % $ 104 $ 27 (2) (7) The Brookwood - Capital One 11/1/2021 - 5.40 % $ 16 $ - (2) (7) Adair off Addison and Adair off Addison Apartment Homes 1/1/2021 1.55 % 2.32 % $ 87 $ - (1) (3) (5) 1000 Spalding Crossing 1/1/2022 - 3.88 % $ 108 $ 39 (2) (5) Riverlodge 5/1/2022 - 3.76 % $ 144 $ 130 (2) (7) Verdant Apartment Homes 5/1/2023 - 3.89 % $ 154 $ 26 (2) (5) Arcadia Apartment Homes 5/1/2023 - 3.89 % $ 167 $ 19 (2) Grand Reserve 6/1/2023 2.57 % 3.34 % $ 185 $ 88 (1) (3) (6) Montclair Terrace 6/1/2023 2.45 % 3.22 % $ 93 $ 21 (1) (3) (7) Breckenridge 7/1/2023 2.36 % 3.13 % $ 213 $ 54 (1) (3) (5) Santa Rosa 9/1/2026 2.11 % 2.88 % $ 146 $ 98 (1) (3) (5) Windbrooke Crossing 1/1/2024 2.69 % 3.46 % $ 194 $ 70 (1) (3) (5)  (1) Variable rate based on one-month LIBOR of 0.77167% (as of December 31, 2016) plus a fixed margin  (2) Fixed rate  (3) Variable rate hedged with interest rate cap cash flow hedge  (4) Fixed rate interest rate swap associated with the variable rate debt  (5) Monthly interest-only payment currently required  (6) Monthly fixed principal plus interest payment required  (7) Fixed monthly payment of principal and interest payment required  On August 21, 2015, we recorded a fair value adjustment, which represented the fair value of the debt assumed over its principal amount in connection with The Brookwood Apartment Home acquisition. The fair value will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related mortgages loans using the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2016, the net unamortized mortgage premium was $546,607 and was included as a component of mortgage loans payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Operating Properties As of December 31, 2016, our wholly-owned interests in multifamily properties were as follows: Apartment Subsidiary Complex Number of Units Property Location RRE Bear Creek Holdings, LLC, or Adair off Bear Creek Addison 152 Dallas, TX RRE Oak Hill Holdings, LLC, or Overton Trails Oak Hill Apartment Homes 360 Fort Worth, TX RRE Buckhead Holdings, LLC, or Buckhead Uptown Buckhead 216 Atlanta, GA RRE Farrington Holdings, LLC, or Crosstown at Farrington Chapel Hill 411 Chapel Hill, NC RRE Mayfair Chateau Holdings, LLC, or Mayfair Chateau The Brookwood 274 Homewood, AL RRE Fairways of Bent Tree Adair off Holdings, LLC, or Fairways of Addison Bent Tree Apartment Homes 200 Dallas, TX RRE Spalding Crossing Holdings, 1000 Spalding LLC, or Spalding Crossing Crossing 252 Atlanta, GA RRE Montclair Terrace Holdings, LLC, or Montclair Holdings Montclair 188 Portland, OR RRE Canterwood Holdings, LLC, or Verdant Canterwood Apartment Homes 216 Boulder, CO RRE Grand Reserve Holdings, LLC, or Grand Reserve Grand Reserve 319 Naperville, IL RRE Fox Ridge Holdings, LLC, or Arcadia Fox Ridge Apartment Homes 300 Centennial, CO RRE Riverlodge Holdings, LLC, or Riverlodge Riverlodge 498 Austin, TX RRE Breckenridge Holdings, LLC, or Breckenridge Breckenridge 357 Portland, OR RRE Santa Rosa Holdings, LLC, or Santa Rosa Santa Rosa 476 Irving, TX RRE Windbrooke Holdings, LLC, or Windbrooke Windbrooke Crossing Crossing 236 Buffalo Grove, IL RRE Woods Holdings, LLC, or The The Woods of Woods of Burnsville Burnsville 400 Burnsville, MN 4,855  As four of our multifamily properties are located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, three of our properties are located in the Atlanta area, two of our properties are located in Portland, Oregon and two of our properties are located in the Denver area, our portfolio is particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in these real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for multifamily rentals resulting from the local business climate, could negatively affect our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.

An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.
