(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion contains management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10�Q and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" following the Table of Contents. Unless otherwise noted, the figures in the following discussion are unaudited.  Overview  We are the global leader in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of performance-driven golf products, which are widely recognized for their quality excellence. Today, we are the steward of two of the most revered brands in golf-Titleist, one of golf's leading performance equipment brands, and FootJoy, one of golf's leading performance wear brands. We own or control the design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products. In doing so, we are able to exercise control over every step of the manufacturing process.  Our target market is dedicated golfers, who are avid and skill-biased, prioritize performance and commit the time, effort and money to improve their game. We believe that dedicated golfers are the most consistent purchasers of golf products.  Our net sales are diversified by both product category and mix as well as geography. Our product categories include golf balls, golf clubs, wedges and putters, golf shoes, golf gloves, golf gear and golf outerwear and apparel. Our product portfolio contains a favorable mix of consumable products, which we consider to be golf balls and golf gloves, and more durable products, which we consider to be golf clubs, golf shoes, golf gear and golf outerwear and apparel. Our net sales are also diversified by geography with a substantial majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 generated in five countries: the United States, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and Canada.  The following are financial highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net sales $ 433,615 $ 439,935 Net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. $ 38,114 $ 23,662 Adjusted EBITDA $ 78,462 $ 79,243  We have the following reportable segments: Titleist golf balls; Titleist golf clubs; Titleist golf gear; and FootJoy golf wear.  Table of Contents  Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations  There have been no material changes to the key factors affecting our results of operations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Key Performance Measures  We use various financial metrics to measure and evaluate our business, including, among others: (i) net sales on a constant currency basis,  Since 49% and 48% of our net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were generated outside of the United States, we use net sales on a constant currency basis to evaluate the sales performance of our business in period over period comparisons and for forecasting our business going forward. Constant currency information allows us to estimate what our sales performance would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is calculated by taking the current period local currency sales and translating them into U.S. dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period. This constant currency information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of constant currency information may not be consistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies.  We primarily use Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products, go to market execution and costs to incur across our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA in a manner consistent with the term "Consolidated EBITDA" as it is defined in the credit agreement, dated as of April 27, 2016, among Acushnet Holdings Corp., Acushnet Company, Acushnet Canada Inc. (the "Canadian Borrower"), Acushnet Europe Limited (the "UK Borrower") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the administrative agent, L/C issuer and swing line lender (our "credit agreement"). Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. adjusted for income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, the expenses relating to the Acushnet Company Equity Appreciation Rights Plan, as amended (the "EAR Plan"), share-based compensation expense, a one-time executive bonus, restructuring charges, certain transaction fees, indemnification expense (income) from Beam, (gains) losses on the fair value of our common stock warrants, certain other non-cash (gains) losses, net and the net income relating to noncontrolling interests in our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. as a measure of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items, or affected by similar non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp., see "-Results of Operations."  We also use Adjusted EBITDA margin, which measures our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, because our management uses it to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products, go to market execution and costs to incur across our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA margin as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. By presenting Adjusted EBITDA margin, we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between different periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items, or affected by similar non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Our definition and  Table of Contents  calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.  Lastly, we use segment operating income to evaluate and assess the performance of each of our reportable segments and to make budgeting decisions.  Components of Results of Operations  There have been no material changes to the components of results of operations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our results of operations. Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net sales $ 433,615 $ 439,935 Cost of goods sold 207,200 214,066 Gross profit 226,415 225,869 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 147,998 155,318 Research and development 12,507 11,130 Intangible amortization 1,622 1,649 Restructuring charges - 587 Income from operations 64,288 57,185 Interest expense, net 2,922 13,841 Other (income) expense, net (749) 1,383 Income before income taxes 62,115 41,961 Income tax expense 22,485 16,769 Net income 39,630 25,192 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,516) (1,530) Net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. $ 38,114 $ 23,662 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. $ 38,114 $ 23,662 Income tax expense 22,485 16,769 Interest expense, net 2,922 13,841 Depreciation and amortization 10,161 10,270 Share-based compensation(a) 3,847 - One-time executive bonus(b) - 7,500 Restructuring charges(c) - 587 Transaction fees(d) 94 3,701 Beam indemnification expense (income)(e) (93) (494) (Gains) losses on the fair value of our common stock warrants(f) - 1,879 Other non-cash (gains) losses, net (584) (2) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(g) 1,516 1,530 Adjusted EBITDA $ 78,462 $ 79,243 Adjusted EBITDA margin 18.1 % 18.0 %  Table of Contents  (b) In the first quarter of 2016, our President and Chief Executive Officer was awarded a cash bonus in the amount of $7.5 million as consideration for past performance.

(e) Reflects the non-cash charges related to the indemnification obligations owed to us by Beam that are included when calculating net income (loss) attributable to the Company.

(g) Reflects the net income attributable to the interest that we do not own in our FootJoy golf shoe joint venture.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Net Sales  Net sales decreased by $6.3 million, or 1.4%, to $433.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $439.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have decreased by $3.6 million, or 0.8%, to $436.3 million. The decrease in net sales on a constant currency basis was due to a decrease of $12.5 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs driven by lower volumes of wedges and irons which were in the second year of their two-year product life cycle. This net sales decrease was partially offset by an increase of $4.1 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls driven by the introduction of the new Pro V1 and Pro V1x models which were launched in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of $2.8 million in net sales of Titleist golf gear. The remaining change in net sales was due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments.  Net sales by reportable segment is summarized as follows:   Three months ended Constant Currency March 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 $ change % change $ change % change (in thousands) Titleist golf balls $ 134,192 $ 130,373 $ 3,819 2.9 % $ 4,097 3.1 % Titleist golf clubs 101,942 115,492 (13,550) (11.7) % (12,508) (10.8) % Titleist golf gear 42,390 39,552 2,838 7.2 % 2,775 7.0 % FootJoy golf wear 142,241 144,630 (2,389) (1.7) % (518) (0.4) %  For further discussion of each reportable segment's results, see "-Segment Results-Titleist Golf Balls Segment," "-Segment Results-Titleist Golf Clubs Segment," "-Segment Results-Titleist Golf Gear Segment" and "-Segment Results-FootJoy Golf Wear Segment" results below.  Table of Contents  Net sales information by region is summarized as follows:   Three months ended Constant Currency March 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 $ change % change $ change % change (in thousands) United States $ 223,115 $ 230,015 $ (6,900) (3.0) % $ (6,900) (3.0) % EMEA 68,009 73,315 (5,306) (7.2) % 571 0.8 % Japan 50,053 55,327 (5,274) (9.5) % (5,868) (10.6) % Korea 49,882 38,551 11,331 29.4 % 9,305 24.1 % Rest of world 42,556 42,727 (171) (0.4) % (665) (1.6) % Total sales $ 433,615 $ 439,935 $ (6,320) (1.4) % $ (3,557) (0.8) %  Net sales in the United States decreased by $6.9 million, or 3.0%, to $223.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $230.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease in net sales in the United States was due to a decrease of $6.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs and a decrease of $3.3 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear, partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls. Net sales in the United States were impacted by a reduced store count as a result of the retail channel disruptions in 2016 caused by the bankruptcy of the Sports Authority, Inc. and the reorganization efforts and ultimate bankruptcy of Golfsmith International Holdings LP.  Our sales in regions outside of the United States increased by $0.6 million, or 0.3%, to $210.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $209.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis, net sales in such regions would have increased by $3.3 million, or 1.6%, to $213.2 million, driven by an increase of $2.8 million in net sales of FootJoy golf wear, an increase of $2.2 million in net sales of Titleist golf gear, and an increase of $2.0 million in net sales of Titleist golf balls, offset partially by a decrease of $6.3 million in net sales of Titleist golf clubs. The remaining change in net sales was due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments.  More information on our sales by reportable segment and by region can be found in Note 13-Segment Information to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased by $0.5 million to $226.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $225.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Gross margin increased to 52.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 51.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit was largely driven by a $6.0 million increase in gross profit in Titleist golf balls as a result of a golf ball mix shift to the Pro V1 and ProV1x franchise, offset by a decrease of $9.7 million in gross profit in Titleist golf clubs. The remaining increase in gross profit was largely due to sales volume growth of products that are sold in regions outside the United States and that are not allocated to one of our four reportable segments. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the favorable mix shift to the Pro V1 and Pro V1x franchise.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $7.3 million to $148.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $155.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $7.5 million one-time executive bonus and $3.6 million in transaction costs related to our initial public offering, each recorded in the first quarter of 2016, and a reduction of $2.5 million related to promotional and selling costs related to golf club launches in the first quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million in share based compensation and an increase of $3.1 million due to higher consulting, legal and administrative costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $0.6 million.  Table of Contents  Research and Development  R&D expenses increased by $1.4 million to $12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to employee related costs, including share based compensation, and additional experimental costs to support new product introductions. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, R&D expenses were 2.9%, up from 2.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Intangible Amortization  Intangible amortization expenses were $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, unchanged, compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Restructuring Charges  There were no restructuring charges for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.6 million restructuring changes for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Interest Expense, net  Interest expense decreased by $10.9 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $13.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of the conversion of our 7.5% convertible notes to common shares prior to the closing of our initial public offering and the redemption of $34.5 million of the principal of our outstanding 7.5% bonds using the proceeds of the exercise of a portion of our outstanding common stock warrants in July 2016. In addition, the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was lower during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Other (Income) Expense, net  Other income increased by $2.1 million to income of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to an expense of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This change was primarily due to a loss recognized on the fair value of the common stock warrants of $1.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The warrants were fully exercised in 2016 and no warrants were outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense increased by $5.7 million, to $22.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate ("ETR") was 36.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 40.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in ETR was primarily driven by a decrease in non-deductible transaction costs, a reduction in non-cash fair value losses on common stock warrants which are not tax effected, offset by incremental tax expense associated with the settlement of vested restricted stock units and changes to the geographic mix of earnings.  Net Income Attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp.  Net income attributable to Acushnet Holdings Corp. increased by $14.4 million to $38.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $23.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily as a result of lower interest expense and higher income from operations, as discussed in more detail above.  Table of Contents  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $0.7 million to $78.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $79.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased slightly to 18.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 18.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Segment Results Net sales by reportable segment is summarized as follows: Three months ended Constant Currency March 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 $ change % change $ change % change (in thousands) Titleist golf balls $ 134,192 $ 130,373 $ 3,819 2.9 % $ 4,097 3.1 % Titleist golf clubs 101,942 115,492 (13,550) (11.7) % (12,508) (10.8) % Titleist golf gear 42,390 39,552 2,838 7.2 % 2,775 7.0 % FootJoy golf wear 142,241 144,630 (2,389) (1.7) % (518) (0.4) %  Segment operating income by reportable segment is summarized as follows:   Three months ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2017 2016 $ change % change (in thousands) Segment operating income(1) Titleist golf balls $ 21,080 $ 15,499 $ 5,581 36.0 % Titleist golf clubs 11,364 19,582 (8,218) (42.0) % Titleist golf gear 7,292 5,456 1,836 33.7 % FootJoy golf wear 21,103 19,655 1,448 7.4 %  More information on our net sales by reportable segment and segment operating income can be found in Note 13-Segment Information to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Titleist Golf Balls Segment  Net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment increased by $3.8 million, or 2.9%, to $134.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $130.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis, net sales in our Titleist golf balls segment would have increased by $4.1 million, or 3.1%, to $134.5 million. This increase was driven by a sales volume shift due to the introduction of the latest generation of Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls, which have a higher average selling price than our performance golf ball models, which experienced a sales volume decline as a result of being in their second model year.  Titleist golf balls segment operating income increased by $5.6 million, or 36.0%, to $21.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $15.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was driven by higher gross profit of $6.0 million primarily as a result of a golf ball mix shift to the Pro V1 and ProV1x franchise. Operating expenses were up slightly, driven by an increase of $1.4 million in the segment allocation of . . .  May 12, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
