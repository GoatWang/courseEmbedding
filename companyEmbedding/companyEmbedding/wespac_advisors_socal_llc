Market Outlook 

Our Views


Fifteen years ago, Wespac Advisors set out to develop a new approach to investment management to cope with what we saw as the new market reality – the boom and bust cycle from 1995-2002. The world had changed, and Wespac felt that investment management had to change to continue to generate the returns and safety that our clients expected. Since we developed our new approach, we were tested with yet another boom cycle from 2003-2007, the bust cycle in 2008, and now another boom cycle from 2009 through today. Our returns for our clients demonstrate the success of our new approach across some violent markets.
The environment after the 2008 Crisis has continued to change. The link between economic and earnings fundamentals and the markets has become stretched. Central banks around the globe are shamelessly targeting asset prices with monetary policy. Corporations are indulging in financial engineering and stock buybacks, clouding earnings performance. The markets are buffeted daily by the micro boom and bust cycles caused by high frequency trading. The environment is getting even more challenging.
The uncertainty and volatility of the markets over the past 20 years calls into question conventional investment management. Most investment management strategies are based on predictions of the future and speculation about how securities will behave in that context. Wespac Advisors believes that a more flexible and adaptive processes is required to safely deliver market beating returns in this environment.

Manager Commentary 

 


WESPAC Advisors, LLC - Portfolio Update June 2016
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on July 8th, 2016


June was a busy month in the news and in the markets - there was a lot to digest on many dimensions.   Donald Trump received enough delegates to become the presumptive Republican nominee on May 27th.   Hillary Clinton received enough delegates to become the presumptive Democrat nominee on June 6th.    The Federal Reserve, as a commentary in the Wall Street Jou 

 


WESPAC Advisors, LLC - Portfolio Update May 2016
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on June 3rd, 2016


Much like in November 2015, May 2016 was mostly about backing and filling after the big run from the February 2016 lows.  And, like November 2015, May 2016 recovered early losses in the month with two dramatic up days.  The S&P 500 was up a modest +1.5% in May, finishing only 1.6% away from its all-time high and essentially even with its February 2015 close.  The S&P 500  

 


The Normal, The Odd, and The Supernatural
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on May 23rd, 2016


In a much too familiar movie, the Fed is once again signaling that all is well and they will resume their tightening cycle at the June meeting; having watched this movie 4-6 times a year for the last several years, I think we have a pretty good idea what the ending will be.

Manager Commentary 

 


The Earnings Recession Continues
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on February 23rd, 2016


With over 83% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings for fourth quarter 2015, it is clear that the bullish reversal to 2014 earnings levels has failed.   This post explores the earnings picture that continues to disappoint and some of the valuation issues that have developed.  

 


Price Action : Then and Now 
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on February 19th, 2016


The failure of earnings to reverse course to the upside after peaking in 3Q14 puts the equity markets at fundamental risk.
The rolling corrections starting in the summer of 2015 have set up a trading pattern that has some analogies to the patterns seen in late 2007 and early 2008. 

 


Peak Oil, the Resource Curse and the Green Paradox
Submitted by Wespac Advisors, LLC on February 7th, 2016



A decade ago, the notion of Peak Oil had become everyday reading – Peak Oil, or Hubbert’s theory, was the point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached after which it is expected to enter terminal decline.  Most of the older forecasts called for peak oil to occur somewhere in the 2000-2010 time-frame, forever creating a seller’s mar

Our Approach 


Our Strategy
Wespac Advisors has developed a sophisticated systematic approach to implementing tactical asset allocation across asset classes and across investment horizons. This approach helps us identify market leadership to keep our portfolios allocated to the right asset classes and the right securities at the right time. We participate in asset classes that are leading the market, and, when safe assets lead, we tactically shift our allocations to that new leadership. The Wespac approach is not a process based on academic research, predictions, and speculation – it is a disciplined process that has been deployed across all types of market environments.


Tactical Asset Allocation


Most investment management strategies are based on predictions of the future and speculation about how securities will behave in that context. Given the difference in performance between the leaders and the laggards across all markets, there are substantial risks in holding the wrong positions at the wrong time. Tactical asset allocation helps you participate in what the markets are actually doing, as opposed to what someone thought the markets should do. When applied across asset classes and investment horizons, tactical asset allocation can deliver the best of what all markets have to offer. If you are uncomfortable with the performance of your investments, and you feel there should be a real alternative to conventional portfolio management, that is good thinking.


Relative-Strength Investing


Relative-strength investing is a sophisticated systematic approach to implementing tactical asset allocation and active management. The technology behind relative strength investing helps us identify market leadership across asset classes and investment horizons to keep you allocated to the right asset classes and securities at the right time, including safe assets in times of market distress. If you thought your investment solution should be more transparent, flexible and adaptive to today’s market reality, that is good thinking.
 
 
 


Performance for Clients

Wespac is dedicated to providing sophisticated investment solutions in your own account with full transparency. You can decide how close you want to be to the investment process – we are always available to be your trusted partner in managing your investment portfolio as things change in the markets and in your life. Wespac’s clients are not just assets-under-management to us – the people of Wespac care deeply about your investment performance. We care, because we invest in the same portfolios that you do. If you want a real partner in implementing your investment plan, think about Wespac.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
