Company History
I started, Robert W. Speirs Plumbing Company in 1961 with Marian W. Speirs and myself as sole proprietors. I graduated from the University of Utah in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting and economics. During my college years, I worked part time in plumbing and wet heating. I became licensed as a Journeyman Plumber and obtained a contractors license for Utah State Plumbing and Wet Heating. We started our business with our 1939 white Ford coupe as our first vehicle. I worked alone for our first nine years in business doing small repairs and new construction. I began building a small clientele in Davis and Weber counties including three small home building contractors that remained loyal to us until they retired. Most plumbing companies were using pick-up trucks as their day-to-day work vehicles. I bought a small black metro van and installed pipe racks on the side. It made a change that became a very popular style among work vehicles.
In 1974 we had three employees and rented one of the first buildings available at the Freeport Center in Clearfield, Utah. The Freeport Center was previously the US Naval supply depot. We incorporated in 1979 and became ROBERT W. SPEIRS PLUMBING, INC. Marian and I became the sole stockholders. Constant train traffic in and out of the Freeport Center became time consuming. We looked around our various city business base and bought a building in Kaysville, Utah in 1975. Mornings at this location were a beehive of activity as our seven vans loaded materials from our own warehouse. Our company had expanded to include all sizes of plumbing projects including; residential plumbing, radiant heating, service, repair, and commercial projects.
In 1982, we experienced major competition between union and non-union shops. Ogden, Utah’s first major mall was under construction. As various tenant spaces were leased, other general contractors invited us to bid on tenant improvements. We were awarded several contracts. When the union found out, we were boycotted. Within a few days, support for the boycott fizzled out and we went on with these projects. I feel that over the years we have gained respect from union plumbing companies. Utah is a right-towork state that keeps this competition alive.

Our company had expanded to include all sizes of plumbing projects including; residential plumbing, radiant heating, service, repair, and commercial projects.Leak Detection/RepairMany water leaks come from toilets that are misaligned or the tank components are worn out. Harsh water conditions, including toilet tank cleaners, cause components to break down. A toilet that continues running after the tank has refilled wastes 5-10 gallons of water per hour. That’s 44,000-88,000 gallons of wasted water per toilet, per year. Newer toilets conserve water by only using 1.6 gallons per flush instead of 3.5 gallons per flush. The average person flushes their home toilet 5 times per day. A simple update on your toilet can save nearly 3,500 gallons of water per person, per year.Faucet Repair/ReplacementHydro JettingPlumbing InspectionEmergency ServicesWater Heater Repair/Replacement24/7 ServiceIf your basement or crawl space is flooding because you need a sump pump or if your sump pump is broken, there is no time to waste.
