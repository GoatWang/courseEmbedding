Business Wire




May 4, 2016 4:08 PM EDT













 


















































  As of March 31, 2016, five portfolio companies had an investment rating of "3," with a total cost basis of approximately $95.9 million and a fair value of approximately $51.7 million.   As of March 31, 2016, one portfolio company was on non-accrual status and had an investment rating of "4", with aggregate cost basis of approximately $1.6 million and an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.4 million.  NMFC Senior Loan Program II LLC  On March 9, 2016, the Company and SkyKnight Income, LLC ("SkyKnight") entered into a limited liability company agreement to establish a joint venture, NMFC Senior Loan Program II LLC ("SLP II"). The Company and SkyKnight have committed to provide $79.4 million and $20.6 million of equity, respectively, with a closing date of April 12, 2016. The purpose of the joint venture is to invest primarily in senior secured loans issued by portfolio companies within the Company's core industry verticals. All investment decisions must be unanimously approved by the investment committee of SLP II, which has equal representation from us and SkyKnight. As of March 31, 2016, no capital contributions had been made. SLP II obtained financing and began to invest during the second quarter of 2016.  Recent Developments  The Company has had approximately $51.4 million of originations and commitments since the end of the first quarter through May 2, 2016. This was offset by approximately $81.7 million of repayments and $8.6 million of sales during the same period.  On April 12, 2016, SLP II closed its $275.0 million revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association which matures on April 12, 2021 and bears interest at a rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.75% per annum.  On May 3, 2016, the Company's board of directors declared a second quarter 2016 distribution of $0.34 per share payable on June 30, 2016 to holders of record as of June 16, 2016.

Designed by famed Douglas engineer Ed Heinemann, the F3D Skyknight was a twin-engine night fighter.  A product of the early jet era, the F3D was equipped with the J34 turbojet, and boasted a powerful radar system to locate targets in the shadow of midnight. The XF3D-1 test bed first flew in 1948.  In total, 265 Skyknights would be in service before production ceased in 1952. The Skyknight had an illustrious combat career for both the Navy and Marine Corps. During the Korean War F3Ds flew as bomber escorts during nighttime raids, and as interdiction aircraft.  They downed more enemy planes than any
other aircraft in that conflict.  They continued to serve in the Vietnam War as ECM platforms.  Some Skynights continued to fly as test aircraft into the 80s. Originally printed by Douglas and the U.S. Navy, this handbook provides a fascinating glimpse inside the cockpit of 
this incredible plane.  The manual was recently declassified and is here reprinted in book form.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
