John C Reich's Experience
Title: Member
               Company: State Bar of California
Job Details
               The State Bar created the Justice Gap Fund to benefit the over 270,000 Californians served by civil nonprofit legal aid organizations. The Justice Gap Fund directly benefits the most vulnerable Californians in legal crisis. At heart, legal aid organizations, like class actions, are about making access to justice a reality for those who otherwise could not obtain the protections of our court system. Not only does the Justice Gap Fund fall squarely within the parameters of CCP §384, but it is a worthy and appropriate beneficiary for residual funds:Expand Justice without Conflicts. The State Bar's mission is to "preserve and improve our justice system in order to ensure a free and just society under the law. In this role, the State Bar does not represent parties in court, therefore leaving little possibility for a conflict of interest for either the Court or the Defendant. Benefit a Broad Spectrum of Communities. Undistributed residuals designated to the Justice Gap Fund will be distributed to the network of 95 legal aid organizations that provide free civil legal services to low-income Californians in every county across a wide substantive spectrum. Legal aid organizations step in when families are in crisis to prevent the costly spiral of social problems arising from homelessness, wage loss, deficient healthcare, domestic violence, and more.
Title: Senior Vice President
               Company: Merchant & Gould P.C
Job Details
               Merchant & Gould values our client relationships, and actively partners with clients to understand, build, and implement technology and intellectual property driven strategies that add bottom-line business value. The depth and breadth of our legal and technical knowledge coupled with years of experience in helping clients create and strategically manage global intellectual property assets uniquely positions us to be a valued member of the client team. Technical Expertise: Our attorneys have substantial technical expertise to serve the needs of our clients. A number of attorneys have advanced degrees, including Ph.D.s in their areas of expertise. In addition, the firm employs staff engineers, patent agents, legal assistants and drafting personnel to provide a full range of cost-effective intellectual property legal services. Our Clients: The firm represents a broad spectrum of clients, including individual inventors, emerging companies, Fortune 500 corporations, governmental bodies and academic institutions. Clients represent diverse industries and technologies including chemistry, biotechnology, computer hardware and software, medicine and manufacturing. Connecting Outside the Firm: Giving to the communities in which Merchant & Gould has offices is a core value of the firm. That brand of volunteerism applies to the legal communities as well as to the neighborhoods and cities where the firm's families live.  Merchant & Gould's attorneys are actively involved in various organizations, including the Volunteer Lawyers Network (VLN), American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), Minnesota Intellectual Property Law Association and American Bar Association. Many attorneys have taught at local law schools, been guest lecturers and served in various capacities in moot court activites.  A number of attorneys, in a long-standing collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development, have written and published several editions of A Guide to Intellectual Property Protection, A Legal Guide for the Software Developer and A Legal Guide to the Internet for free distribution.  Any cross-section of the firm will show generous community service. The firm's employees are members of local public radio boards, they volunteer at the Natural History Museum, Minnesota Zoo, Humane Society, American Cancer Society, Habitat for Humanity and Meals on Wheels and they coach and serve as Girl Scout leaders.
