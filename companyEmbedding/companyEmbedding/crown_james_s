Who We Are
Since its entry into the material handling equipment industry in 1960, Crown has earned a reputation as a leading innovator in world-class forklift and material handling equipment.
Crown designs and manufactures up to 85 percent of its lift truck components, including key parts like motors, drive units, and electronic modules. When it says Crown on the outside, it's a Crown on the inside.































































What We Do
From our smallest hand pallet truck to our highest lifting turret truck, Crown designs, manufactures, distributes, services and supports material handling products that provide customers with superior value.
Our broad global dealer network provides a wide variety of quality material handling equipment, storage solutions and support services. 





















Product Development

Design that revolutionizes the way people work. When it comes to forklifts, it’s all about the experience. With a focus on the operator, Crown’s human-centered designs are created to improve productivity, comfort and safety. 








                    Innovation in Action
                




Crown’s approach to industrial product design builds upon advanced ideas for lift truck operator productivity, safety and product life span. Our dedication to researching the human-to-forklift relationship produces forklifts designed with the highest capacities and speeds. Incorporating direct operator feedback into our innovative development process, we can address the issues that matter most to our customers.










                    Infusing Technology
                




At Crown, we harness the power of technology and embed it directly into our product design. Crown-designed automation and fleet management technologies are revolutionizing the material-handling industry. Examples include:

InfoLink, our wireless operator and fleet management solution that puts the power of accurate, up-to-date, business metrics right at your fingertips. 
QuickPick Remote order-picking technology that simplifies workflow to increase productivity and reduce operator fatigue. This advanced technology helps reduce the number of steps order selectors take on and off a forklift’s platform by up to 70 percent.











                    Ergonomics
                




At Crown, we understand the operator costs associated with forklifts. That’s why we design products to make the operator as productive and comfortable as possible while operating our lift trucks. For example, our X10 Handle for walkie pallet and stacker forklifts allows users to complete lifting, traveling and horn functions simultaneously and comfortably with one hand, right or left. These easy-to-use features improve performance and minimize hand and wrist movements.










                    Safety in Focus
                




In all stages of product development, your safety is an integral part of Crown’s forklift design. To help you protect your operators and improve productivity in your workplace, Crown lift trucks are designed with built-in safety features that help keep your operators safe.

























































Where We Are
Crown has an extensive global production, sales and service network to meet customer needs anytime, anywhere. Our strategic locations worldwide offer reliable, flexible and responsive support including sales, service, regional training centers and much more.

Well-Established Roots
Since 1945, Crown has grown from a one-room operation in rural Ohio to one of the top five largest lift truck manufacturers in the world.
 
A History of Innovation
Crown’s history began when two brothers, the late Carl H. Dicke and Allen A. Dicke, founded the company in New Bremen, Ohio, in 1945. Today, the fourth generation of the Dicke family continues to lead Crown.
Production of a line of high-quality lift trucks for intermediate-duty use began in 1960. Crown soon became the fastest-growing material handling company in its range of products. Crown lift trucks have earned a reputation as safe, reliable and productive by customers throughout the world, and the innovative spark that fueled Crown’s past success is still alive today. Crown products continue to receive recognition for design excellence, having earned more than 80 prominent design awards.
Today, Crown manufactures a wide variety of electric and Internal Combustion lift trucks and components in 18 facilities throughout the world. Product sales and service are handled by the company's network of Crown-owned and independent dealers located in key markets. Dealer and sales personnel are factory-trained in all disciplines and backed by advertising.

360 Gold Crown Brush

The New and Amazing 360 GOLD's patented curved design contours to your head allowing more of its extra long bristles to remain in contact with your hair; resulting in deep, continuous, natural waves with far less brushing.  With one use you will see and feel the difference, good for all hair textures. Four rich colors to choose from. High gloss finish.
 


360 Gold Caesar Brush

The 360 GOLD Caesar's compact size and extended side grips fits in the palm of your hand, making it suitable for grooming on the go. Four rich colors to choose from. High gloss finish.
