On target: Tyagarajan joined GE because he wanted a career, not just a job, and became an architect of the BPO business in India. Jayachandran / Mint 

Updated: Fri, Sep 11 2009. 09 11 PM IST

It’s 10.40am on a Friday, and the staff on duty at the Trident, Gurgaon, are beginning to get suspicious of me. 
I’ve been ambling about and shuffling a sheaf of papers for the past 10 minutes, circling one of the lobby’s corner sofas like a predator patrolling his territory. I’m a bit early for my breakfast meeting with N.V. Tyagarajan, the 48-year-old chief operating officer of the business process outsourcing (BPO) firm Genpact, and the staff would really appreciate it if I stopped wearing out the carpet in the interim, thank you very much. 
Dressed in a crisp dark grey suit, and wheeling a suitcase, Tyagarajan is the very image of the roving executive. His handshake is firm. “Hi. I’m Tiger,” he says by way of introduction. 

On target: Tyagarajan joined GE because he wanted a career, not just a job, and became an architect of the BPO business in India. Jayachandran / Mint The story of how “Tiger” became his prefix of choice (it’s even on his visiting card) takes him back nearly 40 years. “I went to a Catholic school in Mumbai, and in (the) second grade we came out of a poetry class, having just learnt Tiger, tiger, burning bright by William Blake,” he says. The name “Tyagarajan” was proving a little too phonetically complex for his Mumbai classmates, and “Tiger” filled that gap competently. “It’s not a bad name to have in the corporate world,” he says.
It is Tyagarajan’s approach to business that has undoubtedly made the name stick. “It’s the way you attack a problem,” he says softly, carefully measuring each sentence before speaking. “Break it down into parts, think about a logical, rational, step-by-step solution—that’s the way I think about a lot of things.” 
It’s an unnervingly precise mechanism for decision-making, but “unnervingly precise” is an accurate descriptor for Tyagarajan’s career, from his early days in Pond’s India to being the COO of the $1 billion (around Rs5,000 crore), 37,000-employee Genpact, which was previously called GE Capital International Services, or Gecis, and was a captive arm of General Electric. 
Tyagarajan orders a “strong” masala chai. “Drink of choice?” I ask. “Not really,” he says, his wispy moustache curling as he breaks into a grin. “But I’ve had two espressos since morning, so I thought I’d take a break from coffee.” 
The early proof-of-concepts for Gecis, the prototype for the Indian BPO industry, were beginning to float around in 1997-98, when Tyagarajan was working with GE Capital. He, along with other BPO pioneers Raman Roy and Pramod Bhasin, conducted pilots (“basic call centre stuff”) that became hugely successful. It excited then GE boss Jack Welch when he visited in 2000. Till 2004, Gecis remained moored to the GE port, providing BPO services only to in-house companies. Tyagarajan, meanwhile, left for the US in 2002 to work with GE Commercial Finance. He returned when Gecis became Genpact, an independent company. By then BPO had become a buzzword. 
“When you’ve built a company and a concept up from scratch, you look at your job, and your career, much differently,” he says. “We’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with BPOs,” he says. “I can see myself doing this particular job for at least 20 more years.”
A student of mechanical engineering at IIT Bombay in the early 1980s, Tyagarajan homed in on his interest early. “I didn’t see myself joining the engineering cadre and designing stuff,” he says. “Commercial decisions attracted me. Working with a team attracted me.” IIM Ahmedabad followed, and in 1985, Tyagarajan landed his first job as sales manager in what was then Pond’s India. “I was very clear that I didn’t want to join brands and product management to begin with. I wanted to hit the road, and hit the ground,” he says. 
Pond’s allowed him to do just that. “I loved the culture of the company. It was action-oriented, and gave far more importance to sales than to the brand. That attracted me. I’m older and wiser now, and I understand the importance of brands, but back then it was just wishy-washy stuff.” 
He joined the western region office in Mumbai, and within a week was on the road in Madhya Pradesh. Talcum powder was Pond’s star performer there, commanding up to 90% of the market share in certain areas. Tyagarajan quickly settled in, dealing with salespersons, stockists and other wizened veterans of the talcum powder trade. “I spent six-and-a-half years there, and loved every second of it,” he says. 
He moved to Citibank in 1991, joining its mortgage business in Chennai. After six months in sales and marketing, he decided to switch tracks to the operations side. “I thought operations was the gateway to a wider career,” he says.
Within a year, he got a chance to make that shift. “Someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘There’s a credit and collections job in the west (Mumbai). I think you should do it.’ I asked why, and they said, ‘It’s a mess. We’d like you to go and clean it up.’ That, to me, was an interesting comment to make to someone who’s never done that stuff before,” Tyagarajan says. 
After this stint in Mumbai, Tyagarajan was posted to Delhi. His wife Viji, then working for ABN Amro, and their son Abhinav, who was born in 1993, stayed on in Mumbai. “Three cities, six jobs, six portfolios. Four years. Typical Citibank career in those days.” 
In 1994, he left Citibank to join GE Capital, a company he’d been fascinated with since its entry into India. 

“With GE, I saw the opportunity to build a 25-year career,” he says. “I actually thought this way: I could be doing credit cards one day, and aircraft engines the next. Changing jobs without changing the company.”
He joined as risk head for GE’s joint venture with HDFC Ltd, called Countrywide. When Gecis started in 1997, he moved to Delhi. “And for the second time, I moved and my wife didn’t move!” he laughs. “Viji was working at Rabobank, and she joined me only after 18 months, when she moved to Aviva.”
In those 18 months, Tyagarajan immersed himself completely in Gecis, often drowning out the mutinous protests of his team, who wished he’d “move back to Mumbai”. “I worked like crazy,” he recalls. “But those were the formative years. Our target was 3,000 people (employees), and by the time I left (for the US) in 2002, we had 12,000.”
“Work is a big part of who I am,” he says. Tyagarajan spends almost 15 days a month travelling on business, a routine that leaves him with precious little time at home. “I probably do not spend enough time at home as I should,” he says. “It’s always a challenge.” He went recently on a 10-day vacation to China with his family, but admits that his ideal holiday would be staying put. 
But every workaholic has a weakness, and Tyagarajan is no exception. “I’m an unbelievably passionate follower of cricket,” he says. I ask him to describe just how big a fan he is. He replies almost immediately. “I would bunk work if there’s a good match on.”

Bhasin steps down as Genpact CEO

Running a company is not new to N V “Tiger” Tyagarajan, the newly-appointed CEO of the country’s largest business process outsourcing (BPO) company Genpact.
In his third stint, as he gears up to lead Genpact, once a GE subsidiary, he joins the ranks of the few chieftains of India Inc who have got the opportunity to lead different subsidiaries of the global giant as CEO more than once.
When his predecessor and founder of Genpact (a GE company till 2003), Pramod Bhasin, decided to hang his boots, Tiger was the obvious successor.
His name had been doing the rounds for quite some time and it was no surprise when Bhasin passed on the baton to Tiger.
But how is his third stint as CEO going to be different? For starters, when he left GE Capital International Services (GECIS) as CEO in 2002, it had only 12,000 employees. Now, in its independent avatar, Genpact employs over 45,000 people. Moreover, Tiger is taking over the reins of Genpact at a time when the BPO giant has already stepped on the growth accelerator. With the acquisition of Headstrong, which gave the company additional IT muscle, it is well placed to compete with the IT giants head on.
An MBA from IIM-Ahemedabad, Tiger started his career with a summer internship with Pond’s India Ltd. Even before he completed his MBA, he had an offer from Pond’s to be the area sales manager of the company. He spent the next six-and-a-half years with Pond’s before leaving the organisation in 1991 as a regional sales manager.
He joined Citibank as a vice-president and auto business director (global consumer banking) in 1991.
When he joined GE in 1994, little did he knew that he would spend the next 17 years leading different group companies and later, Genpact. According to him, the joy of working with GE was that you got to work on different businesses at the same time.
In 1996, he became the CEO for GE Capital’s global consumer and auto financial services operations in India.
During this time, Bhasin was busy convincing GE top bosses that they outsource part of the company’s business to India. In 1997, Bhasin founded GE Capital International Services (GECIS, now Genpact). It was under him that GE hired Raman Roy to spearhead the voice BPO in India. When Roy left the organisation to start his own venture, GE appointed Tiger as the CEO of GECIS in 1999.
According to Roy: “Tiger is a hardworking and a clear-headed person. He puts in a lot of effort, is a team player and a people’s man. All that augurs very well for Genpact now, especially after their Headstrong acquisition.”
Living up to his reputation of being a team builder, Tiger built a team of 12,000 in just three years. When he had joined GECIS in 1999, he was managing a team of 599. The vision was to have 3,000 people in the next five years, a target he surpassed.
Industry insiders also view Tiger as a good manager. While Bhasin is more of an entrepreneur, Tiger is a team man. Even Bhasin exudes confidence in him, saying: “He is the right person to take Genpact forward in its next stage of growth.”
He is hailed as one of the pioneers who transformed GECIS into a high-end business services and technology solutions company with over $1 billion in revenues, serving global enterprises in the banking & finance, insurance, manufacturing, transportation and business-services sectors.
In October 2002, he was transferred within GE to its multi-billion-dollar Commercial Equipment Finance division, Six Sigma and Global Operations, as a senior vice-president. The very next year, GECIS sold 60 per cent stake to General Atlantic Partners and Oak Hill Capital Partners in 2003 and was renamed Genpact.
Tiger rejoined Genpact in 2005 as an executive vice-president based in New York City, and was promoted to the position of COO in 2009.
The COO’s position was specifically created by Genpact to make the transition smooth. Genpact is one of the few companies that have been meticulously planning succession to its top leadership for years.
When Tiger is not expanding his territory, he is busy watching Captain Dhoni lead the Indian cricket team. An avid cricket fan, he tries not to miss any match that India plays. He loves the game in every form — 20-20, ODI or test match — and appreciates Dhoni for his leadership skills. He also loves reading and works out whenever he gets time.
He holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and an MBA in finance and marketing from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
Is his timetable going to change when he sits in Bhasin’s chair from next month, pat comes the reply “nothing is going to change from tomorrow… Just that the canvas has got a bit bigger.”

N.V. 'Tiger'  Tyagarajan
Visionary

Tiger is one of the pioneers of the business process management industry who transformed Genpact from a unit of GE in 1997 into a leading global business process and technology management services company. Tiger began his career with the Unilever Group in India where he spent seven years in sales and marketing. He then shifted to the financial services industry and spent three years with Citibank’s Consumer Financial Services businesses, where he earned a reputation for turning around inefficient businesses. He joined GE Capital in 1994 as Head of Risk in India and went on to become CEO for GE Capital's Global Consumer Finance and Auto Financial Services operations in India. In 2002, he was transferred within GE to the Global Commercial Lending Businesses in the U.S. as Global Head of Six Sigma and Global Operations. Tiger rejoined Genpact in 2005 and became President and CEO in June 2011. 
Tiger has a degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, and an MBA, majoring in Finance and Marketing, from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. By playing a key leadership role in the founding of Genpact, Tiger also spawned the business process management industry as a whole which has had an extraordinary positive impact on economic growth and workforce development in many emerging markets – opening doors to employment, training, and educational opportunities along with infrastructure and services. Genpact also indirectly contributes to the employment of an additional one million people who work in businesses that support the company and its employees.
Known for his extraordinary energy, frequent engagement with clients, and activity in social media forums, Tiger speaks at many industry and global business events including the World Economic Forum and the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. He and his wife have one son who is attending a university in the U.S.
PERSONAL JOURNEYDuring my career, I have believed in joining a company, not just taking a job. After great opportunities working in sales management for Unilever and consumer and commercial finance at Citibank, I read Jack Welch’s two books and decided that I had to work for GE. I interviewed for sales but ended up in risk management because I was so passionate about the company, and I still am. I also believe in continually taking on projects that challenge and stretch your capabilities. By doing this, you take the necessary risks that will bring you to the next level.
