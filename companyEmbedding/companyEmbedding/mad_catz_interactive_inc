The Next Generation of RATs | Mad Catz Gaming Mice

















 









game changing
The Next Generation of RATS











































































Precision Engineered 
Built to withstand
Every RAT in the range is designed from the ground up to be built from the best materials and components to deliver ultimate customization, enhanced gaming performance and reduced fatigue over marathon gaming sessions.
From the entry level RAT1 up to the ultimate $200 RAT PRO X+, hundreds of hours of design, prototyping and testing goes into every part of the product. For example the magnesium alloy chassis of the  RAT PRO X+ is cast in a precision mould to ensure that tolerances are perfect.
Ultra-reliable OMRON switches with an industry leading life of 50 million clicks ensure that even the highest Actions Per Minute (APM) gamers will never miss an attack.







Swappable scroll wheels, thumb rests, pinkie rests and palms rests offer up to 2700 different physical configurations.


Revolutionary Scroll Wheel System – Introducing lateral analog strafe. Wheel pivot adds an extra analog axis enabling pinpoint precision. Hot swap wheels and adjust the rotation tension.


Ultra-reliable OMRON switches with an industry leading life of 50 million clicks 


Magnesium alloy chassis that’s light and super strong. 


Swappable Sensors – Choose from multiple Interchangeable sensor modules 


Pro Slide Technology -  Teflon and ceramic skis for a choice of coefficient of friction.


Titanium screw fittings and a carbon fibre thumb-plate


Super hydrophobic coating
















Dynamic Ergonomics
Customize your RAT to enhance your playing style.
All gamers are different. You don’t have to worry about whether you have the right mouse for your preferred grip. Our RATs are precision engineered to be physically adjustable, so that one RAT can support all three common grip types


Palm

This style is referred to as the Palm grip due to the entire surface area of the palm and fingers being supported by the RAT. As the whole hand is supported, this grip provides reduced fatigue over long gaming sessions. Whilst this style provides plenty of precise movement control, reaction speeds may be fractionally lower than the twitchier fingertip and claw grips.




Claw

The claw grip reduces the points of contact on that RAT. It acts as a mid-point between the Palm and Fingertip grips. The gamers’ fingers are arched over the RAT, and the lower part of the palm supported by the palm rest. As a result, reaction times are increased due to buttons being actuated by only the fingertips, and with less of the weight of your hand resting on the RAT, movement speed increases. 




fingertip

The fingertip grip is the ultimate grip for high-speed twitchy response. This style relies solely on the fingertips of the hand as the only points of contact on the product. Without the weight of your palm on the product, you reduce all unnecessary mass that weighs the RAT down. Whilst providing the fastest response in game, it will also require the most practise to get the most out of the grip.













Kameleon RGB Lighting 
Intelligent lighting control - 16.8 million colors
Take the RAT to a new dimension of customization
with 3 independent RGB Illumination Zones. 
Fine tune your color and lighting to make your 
RAT the centre piece of your gaming rig.

Using the preset themes you can also control the speed of LED effects, such as breathing, heartbeat and color cycling – click on the icons and try them out here.

Flux interface
Powerful software to customize performance 
RAT customization goes beyond the physical. Regardless of your preferred 
genre or style of play, every aspect of the sensor, button output and lighting 
can be tweaked to enhance performance.

Profiles: Create and edit unlimited profiles for all your games and desktop software. Assign complex macro commands with timing accuracy to 1/1000th of a second to any of the programmable controls. 
Precision Aim : Increase or decrease the sensor speed with one button press, ideal for snipers. 
Sensor: resolution, lift-off height and USB report rate can also be tweaked to perfection.

Mad Catz developed flight simulation software through its internal ThunderHawk Studios, developed flight simulation and chess hardware under its Saitek brand, published games under its Mad Catz brand, and distributed games and video game products for third-party partners. The company was incorporated in Canada and headquartered in San Diego, California.[1] Mad Catz had offices in North America, Europe and Asia.[1]

History[edit]
1989–2000[edit]
Mad Catz was founded in 1989. It focused on accessories such as control pads, memory cards, connection cables, headphones and other human interface devices for the PC and various video game consoles. Mad Catz also published original software titles, such as Real World Golf 1 and 2, MC Groovz Dance Craze, and Pump It Up.
Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 25, 1993. The company was acquired in 2000 by the Toronto-based GTR Group, Inc. for a purchase cost of US$33.3 million, along with Games Trader (which collected and sold previously played and republished games) and ZapYou.com (which focused on e-commerce solutions).[2]
2000–2009[edit]
In 2000, Mad Catz released the MC2 Racing Wheel for the Sony PlayStation, which was awarded the Golden Award by Incite Video Gaming Magazine, and the Mario Andretti Racing Wheel, which GameSpy judged as the best peripheral of the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The company produced 12 licensed controllers for the launch of the Sega Dreamcast and also released Internet-related accessories such as the Panther DC and keyboard adapter.
In September 2001, GTR Group decided to capitalize on the strength of the Mad Catz brand and changed its corporate name to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc., closing its GamesTrader and ZapYou.com business units.[3] The year 2001 saw the release of Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Mad Catz offered products for these launches, such as the Control Pad Pro for GameCube, the Lynx Control Pad and the BeatPad (dancepad) controller for the PlayStation 2, the Game Boy FlipLight, and memory cards for the Xbox.[3]
In January 2003, Mad Catz acquired the GameShark brand, described as "the industry leader in video game enhancement software, [enabling] players to take full advantage of the secret codes, short cuts, hints and cheats incorporated by video game publishers into their game offerings,"[4] and associated intellectual properties from InterAct for USD$5 million.[5]
In September 2007, Mad Catz acquired UK-based company Joytech for USD$3.7 million.[6] In November 2007, Mad Catz further diversified into the videogame accessory market by acquiring European-based manufacturer Saitek for USD$30 million.[7]
In 2008, Capcom commissioned Mad Catz to produce a limited number of ArcadeSticks and six-button controllers, branded as “FightSticks” and “FightPads,” to coincide with the launch of their Street Fighter IV fighting game.[8] Due to the unanticipated demand for these products, production on these controllers was ramped up from their originally limited numbers. The FightStick remains a mainstay of the Mad Catz product line. In 2008, the FightStick's popularity spurred Mad Catz' involvement in the pro-gaming community, and Mad Catz has a strong presence at shows such as EVO, PAX, and San Diego Comic-Con. In 2009, Mad Catz released licensed controllers for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops.
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Mad Catz released officially licensed controllers for Rock Band 3, including a keyboard controller, a microphone controller, drum kits, and two guitar controllers (both the familiar five-button and the Fender Mustang “Pro” 102-button guitar).[9] That same year, Mad Catz acquired TRITTON Technologies, a San Diego-based gaming audio headset firm, in May 2010 for USD$1 million at closing.[10] In June 2010, Mad Catz announced an agreement with Major League Gaming (MLG) to produce the MLG Pro Circuit Controller for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Mad Catz sponsored MLG Pro Circuit Competitions.[11]
In 2011, Mad Catz’ Cyborg-branded R.A.T.7 Gaming Mouse was named “Best PC Accessory of 2010” by IGN.[12] The company returned to software distribution by publishing Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge, Damage Inc. Pacific Squadron WWII (a World War II flight simulation game with a custom joystick), and Rock Band 3. Mad Catz acquired certain assets of V Max Simulation Corporation, which designs, constructs, integrates and operates flight simulation equipment and develops flight simulation software.[13]
Mad Catz has continued its focus on peripherals and accessories, such as the range of R.A.T. gaming mice and TRITTON-branded gaming headsets. In January 2013, Mad Catz announced its "GameSmart" initiative, a range of products using the Bluetooth Smart stack featuring game and hardware independence, simplified setup, longer battery life and universal compatibility. Announced products include the R.A.T.M Wireless Mobile Gaming Mouse, the F.R.E.Q.M Mobile Stereo Headset, M.O.U.S.9 Wireless Mouse, and the C.T.R.L.R Mobile Gamepad.[14] The "GameSmart" initiative is intended to introduce an industry standardization to the mobile world.[15]
In June 2013, Mad Catz announced the M.O.J.O. Android Micro Console, described as "a supercharged smart phone with no screen that plugs into your flat screen TV to bring the living room experience to mobile gaming."[16] M.O.J.O. is designed to interact seamlessly with Mad Catz's GameSmart controllers, mice, keyboards, headsets, and the rest of its gaming peripherals.[16] In 2013, Mad Catz produced the Killer Instinct Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition 2, the first fighting game controller available for the Xbox One, the latest Microsoft gaming console, that started shipping in late November 2013.[17]
Mad Catz helped spur interest in the burgeoning field of eSports by sponsoring the inaugural ESL One at Madison Square Garden in October 2014, as well as sponsoring the Capcom Pro Tour featuring Street Fighter IV.[18]
In April 2015, Mad Catz announced that it would co-publish Rock Band 4 along with Harmonix, in addition to making the controllers for the game. Under the terms of the agreement, Mad Catz will be responsible for worldwide retail sales, promotion, and distribution for the Rock Band 4 game and its hardware bundles. Harmonix will handle Rock Band 4 digital sales and content.[19] Rock Band 4 was launched on October 6, 2015.
In August 2015, Mad Catz announced that it will work with Cloud Imperium Games to create licensed simulation products for its space simulation game Star Citizen.[20] These products, produced under Mad Catz's Saitek brand, were first unveiled at Gamescom 2015.[21]
On February 9, 2016, Mad Catz announced that it would lay off 37 percent of its workforce and stated that "Rock Band sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers."[22] This followed the resignations of company president and CEO Darren Richardson, senior VP of business affairs Whitney Peterson, and company chairman Thomas Brown the day prior.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech acquired Saitek, Mad Catz' simulation brand specializing in computer joysticks for $13 million.[24]
In March 2017, the New York Stock Exchange reported to the company that it was in the stages of delisting the company from the Exchange due to "abnormally low" stock value, which Mad Catz does not plan to appeal.[25]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Mad Catz ceased operations on March 30, 2017, and filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy code to initiate an orderly liquidation of its assets. [26]

I ordered the Mad Catz RAT4 mouse two days ago and when I opened the box it had a used M.O.U.S. 9 Wireless Mouse in the Rat 4 box. Guess they figured they had to send me something to meet the prime delivery date. So disappointed. I'm afraid to try again.

This buyout reflects the company’s strategy to fortify its Logitech G gaming product line.Saitek Under Logitech's WingIn particular, Logitech has acquired Mad Catz Interactive’s Saitek brand along with the Saitek line of flight, space and farm simulation game controllers. Mad Catz’s divested assets comprise specified trademarks, equipment & tooling, inventory and technical data. It also includes every other element required to design, market and distribute Saitek brand’s interactive simulation controllers.Mad Catz is in the midst of a portfolio-pruning drive to optimize growth. The company believes that divesting the Saitek portfolio will enable it to channelize resources to key growth areas, namely Mad Catz and Tritton video game accessories and headset brands. The company expects that Logitech’s profound expertise will aid Saitek in scaling new heights within the flight-simulation community.Buyout Conducive to Logitech G gamingThough Logitech has clarified that the Saitek buyout will not have a material impact on its quarterly or full-year financial results, there is no denying the fact that it will fortify the company’s position in the gaming domain. Logitech’s gaming business has emerged as one of its strongest growth drivers.LOGITECH INTL Price LOGITECH INTL Price | LOGITECH INTL QuoteDuring first-quarter fiscal 2017, it continued charting its robust growth trajectory and was up 29%, benefiting from product launches, marketing initiatives and growing trend of PC gaming in Asia-Pacific. The company expects the momentum in its Gaming category to continue in the quarters ahead on the back of a solid product portfolio. In this regard, the Saitek takeover will clearly boost the Logitech G gaming product portfolio, including G29 and G920 Driving Force steering wheels.Logitech currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Trading in the Company’s common stock on the NYSE MKT will be suspended immediately. NYSE Regulation has determined that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1003 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide, due to the abnormally low trading price of its common stock. The Company has a right to a review of staff’s determination to delist the common stock by a committee of the Board of Directors of the Exchange. The NYSE MKT will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the Company’s common stock upon completion of all applicable procedures, including any appeal by the Company of the NYSE Regulation staff’s decision.

Feb 23 17
Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. announced that on February 20, 2017, it received notice from the NYSE MKT indicating that, based on the Company’s stockholders’ deficit of $2.7 million as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company is not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) or 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (Company Guide). Section 1003(a)(i) of the Company Guide requires a company that has had losses from continuing operations in two of its three most recent fiscal years to have at least $2.0 million of stockholders’ equity. Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Company Guide requires a company that has had losses from continuing operations in three of its four most recent fiscal years to have at least $4.0 million of stockholders’ equity. The Company is required to and expects to submit a plan to the NYSE MKT by March 22, 2017 advising of actions it has taken or intends to take to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by August 20, 2018. If the Company fails to submit a plan by the deadline, or if the Company’s plan is not accepted by the NYSE MTK or it fails to regain compliance by the deadline, the NYSE MKT may commence delisting procedures. The Company’s common stock will remain listed on the NYSE MKT while it attempts to regain compliance with the above noted listing standards, subject to the Company’s compliance with other continued listing requirements.

Mad Catz® Announces Sale of Saitek® Simulation Product Line to Logitech




















September 15, 2016 17:30 ET

 | Source: Mad Catz Interactive, Inc.






SAN DIEGO, Sept.  15, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. (“Mad Catz” or “the Company”) (NYSE MKT:MCZ), a global provider of innovative entertainment products, today announced that it has sold its Saitek brand and the Saitek line of flight, space and farm simulation game controller assets to Logitech International S.A. (“Logitech”) (Nasdaq:LOGI) for $13 million in cash. On September 15, 2016, Mad Catz entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Logitech pursuant to which Mad Catz sold certain assets to Logitech for an aggregate cash purchase price of $13 million.  $11 million of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing and $2 million was deposited in escrow to fund any post-closing adjustments or claims. The assets sold by Mad Catz include specified trademarks, equipment and tooling, inventory, technical data and records, and other related documents necessary for the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of interactive flight, space, and farm simulation controllers presently marketed and sold under the Saitek brand.  Additionally, eight of the Company’s research and development employees accepted employment offers with Logitech. Karen McGinnis, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mad Catz, stated, "After a thorough and deliberate process, we believe this sale to Logitech brings Mad Catz attractive and certain value for the flight, space and farm simulation line of Saitek products.  We are pleased to find a company like Logitech that will lead Saitek into its next phase of growth and best support its strong acceptance within the flight simulation community while also allowing us to continue to leverage the world-class mice, keyboards and other products that were originally developed on the back of our acquisition of Saitek in 2007 and are now sold under the Mad Catz brand.” “Our Board and management team are highly focused on enhancing shareholder value and we believe this transaction is consistent with our ongoing efforts, enabling us to improve our financial position and working capital to better support and grow our Mad Catz and Tritton video game accessories and headset brands.  As we continue to evolve our business strategy to operate the Company more strategically while leveraging resources more efficiently, we are confident that the sale of the Saitek brand and product line, along with the other previously-disclosed Company-wide initiatives, will result in improved financial performance and shareholder value.” The transaction was recommended by a special committee of the Company’s Board of Directors consisting solely of disinterested directors and approved by the full Board of Directors. Wedbush Securities acted as financial advisor to Mad Catz in connection with the transaction and Stout Risius Ross Advisors rendered a fairness opinion. About Mad CatzMad Catz Interactive, Inc.

History[edit]
1989–2000[edit]
Mad Catz was founded in 1989. It focused on accessories such as control pads, memory cards, connection cables, headphones and other human interface devices for the PC and various video game consoles. Mad Catz also published original software titles, such as Real World Golf 1 and 2, MC Groovz Dance Craze, and Pump It Up.
Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 25, 1993. The company was acquired in 2000 by the Toronto-based GTR Group, Inc. for a purchase cost of US$33.3 million, along with Games Trader (which collected and sold previously played and republished games) and ZapYou.com (which focused on e-commerce solutions).[2]
2000–2009[edit]
In 2000, Mad Catz released the MC2 Racing Wheel for the Sony PlayStation, which was awarded the Golden Award by Incite Video Gaming Magazine, and the Mario Andretti Racing Wheel, which GameSpy judged as the best peripheral of the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The company produced 12 licensed controllers for the launch of the Sega Dreamcast and also released Internet-related accessories such as the Panther DC and keyboard adapter.
In September 2001, GTR Group decided to capitalize on the strength of the Mad Catz brand and changed its corporate name to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc., closing its GamesTrader and ZapYou.com business units.[3] The year 2001 saw the release of Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Mad Catz offered products for these launches, such as the Control Pad Pro for GameCube, the Lynx Control Pad and the BeatPad (dancepad) controller for the PlayStation 2, the Game Boy FlipLight, and memory cards for the Xbox.[3]
In January 2003, Mad Catz acquired the GameShark brand, described as "the industry leader in video game enhancement software, [enabling] players to take full advantage of the secret codes, short cuts, hints and cheats incorporated by video game publishers into their game offerings,"[4] and associated intellectual properties from InterAct for USD$5 million.[5]
In September 2007, Mad Catz acquired UK-based company Joytech for USD$3.7 million.[6] In November 2007, Mad Catz further diversified into the videogame accessory market by acquiring European-based manufacturer Saitek for USD$30 million.[7]
In 2008, Capcom commissioned Mad Catz to produce a limited number of ArcadeSticks and six-button controllers, branded as “FightSticks” and “FightPads,” to coincide with the launch of their Street Fighter IV fighting game.[8] Due to the unanticipated demand for these products, production on these controllers was ramped up from their originally limited numbers. The FightStick remains a mainstay of the Mad Catz product line. In 2008, the FightStick's popularity spurred Mad Catz' involvement in the pro-gaming community, and Mad Catz has a strong presence at shows such as EVO, PAX, and San Diego Comic-Con. In 2009, Mad Catz released licensed controllers for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops.
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Mad Catz released officially licensed controllers for Rock Band 3, including a keyboard controller, a microphone controller, drum kits, and two guitar controllers (both the familiar five-button and the Fender Mustang “Pro” 102-button guitar).[9] That same year, Mad Catz acquired TRITTON Technologies, a San Diego-based gaming audio headset firm, in May 2010 for USD$1 million at closing.[10] In June 2010, Mad Catz announced an agreement with Major League Gaming (MLG) to produce the MLG Pro Circuit Controller for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Mad Catz sponsored MLG Pro Circuit Competitions.[11]
In 2011, Mad Catz’ Cyborg-branded R.A.T.7 Gaming Mouse was named “Best PC Accessory of 2010” by IGN.[12] The company returned to software distribution by publishing Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge, Damage Inc. Pacific Squadron WWII (a World War II flight simulation game with a custom joystick), and Rock Band 3. Mad Catz acquired certain assets of V Max Simulation Corporation, which designs, constructs, integrates and operates flight simulation equipment and develops flight simulation software.[13]
Mad Catz has continued its focus on peripherals and accessories, such as the range of R.A.T. gaming mice and TRITTON-branded gaming headsets. In January 2013, Mad Catz announced its "GameSmart" initiative, a range of products using the Bluetooth Smart stack featuring game and hardware independence, simplified setup, longer battery life and universal compatibility. Announced products include the R.A.T.M Wireless Mobile Gaming Mouse, the F.R.E.Q.M Mobile Stereo Headset, M.O.U.S.9 Wireless Mouse, and the C.T.R.L.R Mobile Gamepad.[14] The "GameSmart" initiative is intended to introduce an industry standardization to the mobile world.[15]
In June 2013, Mad Catz announced the M.O.J.O. Android Micro Console, described as "a supercharged smart phone with no screen that plugs into your flat screen TV to bring the living room experience to mobile gaming."[16] M.O.J.O. is designed to interact seamlessly with Mad Catz's GameSmart controllers, mice, keyboards, headsets, and the rest of its gaming peripherals.[16] In 2013, Mad Catz produced the Killer Instinct Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition 2, the first fighting game controller available for the Xbox One, the latest Microsoft gaming console, that started shipping in late November 2013.[17]
Mad Catz helped spur interest in the burgeoning field of eSports by sponsoring the inaugural ESL One at Madison Square Garden in October 2014, as well as sponsoring the Capcom Pro Tour featuring Street Fighter IV.[18]
In April 2015, Mad Catz announced that it would co-publish Rock Band 4 along with Harmonix, in addition to making the controllers for the game. Under the terms of the agreement, Mad Catz will be responsible for worldwide retail sales, promotion, and distribution for the Rock Band 4 game and its hardware bundles. Harmonix will handle Rock Band 4 digital sales and content.[19] Rock Band 4 was launched on October 6, 2015.
In August 2015, Mad Catz announced that it will work with Cloud Imperium Games to create licensed simulation products for its space simulation game Star Citizen.[20] These products, produced under Mad Catz's Saitek brand, were first unveiled at Gamescom 2015.[21]
On February 9, 2016, Mad Catz announced that it would lay off 37 percent of its workforce and stated that "Rock Band sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers."[22] This followed the resignations of company president and CEO Darren Richardson, senior VP of business affairs Whitney Peterson, and company chairman Thomas Brown the day prior.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech acquired Saitek, Mad Catz' simulation brand specializing in computer joysticks for $13 million.[24]
In March 2017, the New York Stock Exchange reported to the company that it was in the stages of delisting the company from the Exchange due to "abnormally low" stock value, which Mad Catz does not plan to appeal.[25]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Mad Catz ceased operations on March 30, 2017, and filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy code to initiate an orderly liquidation of its assets. [26]

History[edit]
1989–2000[edit]
Mad Catz was founded in 1989. It focused on accessories such as control pads, memory cards, connection cables, headphones and other human interface devices for the PC and various video game consoles. Mad Catz also published original software titles, such as Real World Golf 1 and 2, MC Groovz Dance Craze, and Pump It Up.
Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 25, 1993. The company was acquired in 2000 by the Toronto-based GTR Group, Inc. for a purchase cost of US$33.3 million, along with Games Trader (which collected and sold previously played and republished games) and ZapYou.com (which focused on e-commerce solutions).[2]
2000–2009[edit]
In 2000, Mad Catz released the MC2 Racing Wheel for the Sony PlayStation, which was awarded the Golden Award by Incite Video Gaming Magazine, and the Mario Andretti Racing Wheel, which GameSpy judged as the best peripheral of the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The company produced 12 licensed controllers for the launch of the Sega Dreamcast and also released Internet-related accessories such as the Panther DC and keyboard adapter.
In September 2001, GTR Group decided to capitalize on the strength of the Mad Catz brand and changed its corporate name to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc., closing its GamesTrader and ZapYou.com business units.[3] The year 2001 saw the release of Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Mad Catz offered products for these launches, such as the Control Pad Pro for GameCube, the Lynx Control Pad and the BeatPad (dancepad) controller for the PlayStation 2, the Game Boy FlipLight, and memory cards for the Xbox.[3]
In January 2003, Mad Catz acquired the GameShark brand, described as "the industry leader in video game enhancement software, [enabling] players to take full advantage of the secret codes, short cuts, hints and cheats incorporated by video game publishers into their game offerings,"[4] and associated intellectual properties from InterAct for USD$5 million.[5]
In September 2007, Mad Catz acquired UK-based company Joytech for USD$3.7 million.[6] In November 2007, Mad Catz further diversified into the videogame accessory market by acquiring European-based manufacturer Saitek for USD$30 million.[7]
In 2008, Capcom commissioned Mad Catz to produce a limited number of ArcadeSticks and six-button controllers, branded as “FightSticks” and “FightPads,” to coincide with the launch of their Street Fighter IV fighting game.[8] Due to the unanticipated demand for these products, production on these controllers was ramped up from their originally limited numbers. The FightStick remains a mainstay of the Mad Catz product line. In 2008, the FightStick's popularity spurred Mad Catz' involvement in the pro-gaming community, and Mad Catz has a strong presence at shows such as EVO, PAX, and San Diego Comic-Con. In 2009, Mad Catz released licensed controllers for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops.
2010–2017[edit]

In June 2013, Mad Catz announced the M.O.J.O. Android Micro Console, described as "a supercharged smart phone with no screen that plugs into your flat screen TV to bring the living room experience to mobile gaming."[16] M.O.J.O. is designed to interact seamlessly with Mad Catz's GameSmart controllers, mice, keyboards, headsets, and the rest of its gaming peripherals.[16] In 2013, Mad Catz produced the Killer Instinct Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition 2, the first fighting game controller available for the Xbox One, the latest Microsoft gaming console, that started shipping in late November 2013.[17]

Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. was an American company that provided interactive entertainment products marketed under Mad Catz, GameShark (gaming products) and TRITTON (audio products). Mad Catz developed flight simulation software through its internal ThunderHawk Studios, developed flight simulation and chess hardware under its Saitek brand, published games under its Mad Catz brand, and distributed games and video game products for third-party partners. The company was incorporated in Canada and headquartered in San Diego, California.[1] Mad Catz had offices in North America, Europe and Asia.[1]

History[edit]
1989–2000[edit]
Mad Catz was founded in 1989. It focused on accessories such as control pads, memory cards, connection cables, headphones and other human interface devices for the PC and various video game consoles. Mad Catz also published original software titles, such as Real World Golf 1 and 2, MC Groovz Dance Craze, and Pump It Up.
Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on August 25, 1993. The company was acquired in 2000 by the Toronto-based GTR Group, Inc. for a purchase cost of US$33.3 million, along with Games Trader (which collected and sold previously played and republished games) and ZapYou.com (which focused on e-commerce solutions).[2]
2000–2009[edit]
In 2000, Mad Catz released the MC2 Racing Wheel for the Sony PlayStation, which was awarded the Golden Award by Incite Video Gaming Magazine, and the Mario Andretti Racing Wheel, which GameSpy judged as the best peripheral of the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The company produced 12 licensed controllers for the launch of the Sega Dreamcast and also released Internet-related accessories such as the Panther DC and keyboard adapter.
In September 2001, GTR Group decided to capitalize on the strength of the Mad Catz brand and changed its corporate name to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc., closing its GamesTrader and ZapYou.com business units.[3] The year 2001 saw the release of Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Mad Catz offered products for these launches, such as the Control Pad Pro for GameCube, the Lynx Control Pad and the BeatPad (dancepad) controller for the PlayStation 2, the Game Boy FlipLight, and memory cards for the Xbox.[3]
In January 2003, Mad Catz acquired the GameShark brand, described as "the industry leader in video game enhancement software, [enabling] players to take full advantage of the secret codes, short cuts, hints and cheats incorporated by video game publishers into their game offerings,"[4] and associated intellectual properties from InterAct for USD$5 million.[5]
In September 2007, Mad Catz acquired UK-based company Joytech for USD$3.7 million.[6] In November 2007, Mad Catz further diversified into the videogame accessory market by acquiring European-based manufacturer Saitek for USD$30 million.[7]
In 2008, Capcom commissioned Mad Catz to produce a limited number of ArcadeSticks and six-button controllers, branded as “FightSticks” and “FightPads,” to coincide with the launch of their Street Fighter IV fighting game.[8] Due to the unanticipated demand for these products, production on these controllers was ramped up from their originally limited numbers. The FightStick remains a mainstay of the Mad Catz product line. In 2008, the FightStick's popularity spurred Mad Catz' involvement in the pro-gaming community, and Mad Catz has a strong presence at shows such as EVO, PAX, and San Diego Comic-Con. In 2009, Mad Catz released licensed controllers for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops.
2010–2017[edit]
In 2010, Mad Catz released officially licensed controllers for Rock Band 3, including a keyboard controller, a microphone controller, drum kits, and two guitar controllers (both the familiar five-button and the Fender Mustang “Pro” 102-button guitar).[9] That same year, Mad Catz acquired TRITTON Technologies, a San Diego-based gaming audio headset firm, in May 2010 for USD$1 million at closing.[10] In June 2010, Mad Catz announced an agreement with Major League Gaming (MLG) to produce the MLG Pro Circuit Controller for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Mad Catz sponsored MLG Pro Circuit Competitions.[11]
In 2011, Mad Catz’ Cyborg-branded R.A.T.7 Gaming Mouse was named “Best PC Accessory of 2010” by IGN.[12] The company returned to software distribution by publishing Jonah Lomu Rugby Challenge, Damage Inc. Pacific Squadron WWII (a World War II flight simulation game with a custom joystick), and Rock Band 3. Mad Catz acquired certain assets of V Max Simulation Corporation, which designs, constructs, integrates and operates flight simulation equipment and develops flight simulation software.[13]
Mad Catz has continued its focus on peripherals and accessories, such as the range of R.A.T. gaming mice and TRITTON-branded gaming headsets. In January 2013, Mad Catz announced its "GameSmart" initiative, a range of products using the Bluetooth Smart stack featuring game and hardware independence, simplified setup, longer battery life and universal compatibility. Announced products include the R.A.T.M Wireless Mobile Gaming Mouse, the F.R.E.Q.M Mobile Stereo Headset, M.O.U.S.9 Wireless Mouse, and the C.T.R.L.R Mobile Gamepad.[14] The "GameSmart" initiative is intended to introduce an industry standardization to the mobile world.[15]
In June 2013, Mad Catz announced the M.O.J.O. Android Micro Console, described as "a supercharged smart phone with no screen that plugs into your flat screen TV to bring the living room experience to mobile gaming."[16] M.O.J.O. is designed to interact seamlessly with Mad Catz's GameSmart controllers, mice, keyboards, headsets, and the rest of its gaming peripherals.[16] In 2013, Mad Catz produced the Killer Instinct Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition 2, the first fighting game controller available for the Xbox One, the latest Microsoft gaming console, that started shipping in late November 2013.[17]
Mad Catz helped spur interest in the burgeoning field of eSports by sponsoring the inaugural ESL One at Madison Square Garden in October 2014, as well as sponsoring the Capcom Pro Tour featuring Street Fighter IV.[18]
In April 2015, Mad Catz announced that it would co-publish Rock Band 4 along with Harmonix, in addition to making the controllers for the game. Under the terms of the agreement, Mad Catz will be responsible for worldwide retail sales, promotion, and distribution for the Rock Band 4 game and its hardware bundles. Harmonix will handle Rock Band 4 digital sales and content.[19] Rock Band 4 was launched on October 6, 2015.
In August 2015, Mad Catz announced that it will work with Cloud Imperium Games to create licensed simulation products for its space simulation game Star Citizen.[20] These products, produced under Mad Catz's Saitek brand, were first unveiled at Gamescom 2015.[21]
On February 9, 2016, Mad Catz announced that it would lay off 37 percent of its workforce and stated that "Rock Band sell-through was lower than originally forecast resulting in higher inventory balances as well as lower margins due to increased promotional activity with retailers."[22] This followed the resignations of company president and CEO Darren Richardson, senior VP of business affairs Whitney Peterson, and company chairman Thomas Brown the day prior.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech acquired Saitek, Mad Catz' simulation brand specializing in computer joysticks for $13 million.[24]
In March 2017, the New York Stock Exchange reported to the company that it was in the stages of delisting the company from the Exchange due to "abnormally low" stock value, which Mad Catz does not plan to appeal.[25]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Mad Catz ceased operations on March 30, 2017, and filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of U.S. Bankruptcy code to initiate an orderly liquidation of its assets. [26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
