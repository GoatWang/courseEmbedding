CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 6  /PRNewswire/ -- Peptimmune, Inc., a privately held biopharmaceutical company announced today the appointment of Thomas P. Mathers, 37, as President.
Mr. Mathers has more than 12 years of executive management, sales and marketing experience in the life sciences and medical device industry.  Mr. Mathers served most recently as President and CEO of Cell Based Delivery, an implantable protein therapeutics delivery company focusing on the areas of hemophilia and cancer.  Prior to Cell Based Delivery, Mr. Mathers was Vice President and General Manager of Cardion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. where he had full P&L responsibility for the Boston based company and its therapeutics development programs for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

Prior to Cardion, Mr. Mathers was with the Genzyme Corporation for 7 years, as Vice President, Strategic Development.  In this capacity, Mr. Mathers was responsible for Genzyme's cardiovascular therapeutics development, business development, and marketing activities.
"Tom has extensive leadership skills and brings valuable strategic, operational and global business development experience to our team at a time of critical growth and development for the company," said Robert Carpenter, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors. "Tom will bring further operational focus and appropriate development intensity to our exciting portfolio of product candidates" added Carpenter.
During his career, Mathers has also held positions in medical device and pharmaceutical sales and marketing with Snowden-Pencer, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc.

About Peptimmune Inc.
Peptimmune, Inc. is a privately held biotechnology company developing specific immunotherapies for treating autoimmune and allergic diseases.  These therapies are designed to be safer and more effective than currently marketed products.
