Did You Know?


In 1960 Dr. Henry Singleton and Dr. George Kozmetsky formed a company called Teledyne.  Loosely translated, Teledyne means Power Through Communication.  Teledyne was formed to capitalize on the coming revolution in which digital technology would replace analog devices and systems in everything we could touch and imagine.

Teledyne has evolved considerably over the years. Today, Teledyne includes a focused set of complementary, high-tech businesses.

The Instrumentation segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, industrial and other applications, electronic test and measurement equipment and harsh environment interconnect products.

Our Digital Imaging segment includes high performance sensors, cameras and systems, within the visible, infrared and X-ray spectra for use in industrial, government and medical applications, as well as micro electro mechanical systems ("MEMS")

Our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment provides sophisticated electronic components and subsystems and communications products, including defense electronics, harsh environment interconnects, data acquisition and communications equipment for aircraft, and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications.

The Engineered Systems segment provides innovative systems engineering and integration, software development and manufacturing solutions for defense, space, environmental and energy applications.

Corporate Information 


Teledyne provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets. We have evolved from a company that was primarily focused on aerospace and defense to one that serves multiple markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. These markets include deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, oceanographic research, air and water quality environmental monitoring, electronics design and development, factory automation and medical imaging. 

Our products include monitoring and control instrumentation for marine and environmental applications, harsh environment interconnects, electronic test and measurement equipment, digital imaging sensors and cameras, aircraft information management systems, and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems. We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and company sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise.

Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation, digital imaging, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. Our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. We intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development. We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings. At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. 

Using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets.

Total sales in 2012 were $2.13 billion.  Teledyne's operations are primarily located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico.
