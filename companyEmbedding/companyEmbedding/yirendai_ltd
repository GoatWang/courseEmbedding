Yirendai Ltd. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter and Full Year 2017
May 22 17
Yirendai Ltd. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Total net revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB 1,021.6 million (USD 148.4 million), increased by 84% from RMB 556.4 million in the same period of 2016. The increase of total net revenue was mainly attributable to the growth of loan origination volume, increased service fees billed to investors and increased monthly fees billed to borrowers as remaining loan balance continued to expand. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB 350.9 million (USD 51.0 million), increased by 166% from RMB 131.7 million in the same period of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB 400.3 million (USD 58.2 million), compared to RMB 401.1 million in the previous quarter and increased by 94% from RMB 206.6 million in the same period of 2016. Diluted income per ADS in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB 5.81 (USD 0.84), compared to RMB 6.28 in the previous quarter and increased by 158% from RMB 2.25 in the same period of 2016. Net cash generated from operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB 564.5 million (USD 82.0 million), compared to RMB 836.1 million in the previous quarter and increased by 30% from RMB 434.3 million in the same period of 2016. The sequential decrease in net cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in loans generated from online channels, which feature a fee collection schedule with monthly payments in addition to the upfront portion. Income before provision for income taxes was RMB 418,648,000 against RMB 209,717,000 a year ago. 

For the second quarter of 2017, total loans facilitated will be in the range of RMB 7,700 million to RMB 7,900 million. Total net revenue will be in the range of RMB 1,070 million to RMB 1,090 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) will be in the range of 24% to 26%.

For the full year 2017, total loans facilitated will be in the range of RMB 33,000 million to RMB 35,000 million. Total net revenue will be in the range of RMB 4,400 million to RMB 4,600 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) will be in the range of 23% to 26%.

Yirendai Ltd., incorporated on September, 2014, is engaged in online consumer finance marketplace business in China. The Company conducts its business in China, through Yi Ren Heng Ye Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Heng Ye) and its consolidated variable interest entity, Heng Cheng Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Heng Cheng). Heng Cheng operates its Website, www.yirendai.com, and has an Internet content provider (ICP) license as an Internet information provider. The Company's online marketplace facilitates standard loan products, express loan products and vertical loan products to borrowers. Uses for these loan products include home remodels, durable good purchases, travel and continuing education.To apply for a standard loan, a borrower needs to complete an online application providing information, such as their People's Republic of China (PRC) identity card information, a bank statement with proof of monthly income and credit report from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), as well as the desired loan amount and term. FastTrack loans are an expanding product that is only available through its mobile applications. To apply for a FastTrack loan, a borrower completes an online application providing their PRC identity card information, e-commerce account information, mobile phone number and a credit card statement, as well as the desired loan amount and duration. This product offers near instantaneous credit approval, allowing borrowers to receive an initial decision in approximately 10 minutes. It offers vertical loan products to information technology (IT) professionals. IT professional loans are unsecured. To apply for an IT professional loan, a borrower needs to provide information, such as their employment information, PRC identity card information, a bank statement with proof of monthly income and a credit report from the PBOC, as well as the desired loan amount and term.The Company's online marketplace provides investors with various investing tools, such as automated investing tool and self-directed investing tool. With its automated investing tool, an investor agrees to invest a specified amount of money to borrowers through its marketplace for a specified period of time. Once an investor commits funds using the tool, his funds are automatically allocated among approved borrowers. Its automated investing tool automatically reinvests investors' funds, as soon as a loan is repaid, enabling investors to speed the reinvestment of cash flows without having to continually revisit its Website or mobile application. The Company's self-directed investing tool enables investors to personally select among the hundreds of lending opportunities to approved borrowers that are posted on its marketplace every day. After selecting a desired loan, the investor then agrees to lend a specified amount of money to a specific borrower through its marketplace for a specified duration, which must match the tenure of the borrower's loan. Its platform provides investors using its self-directed investing tool with the ability to use filters based on credit and application data, such as term, amount and interest rate, to screen loans on its platform for review.The Company maintains a secondary loan market on its marketplace where investors can transfer the loans they hold prior to maturity at the fair value of the remaining loans. This secondary loan market is liquid, with loans typically exchanging hands within the same day it is posted. This liquidity offers investors the opportunity to enter and exit their investments without waiting until maturity.The Company competes with Ren Ren Dai and Lufax.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

NEW YORK, August 29, 2016 – Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the California Central District Court on behalf of all persons or entities who acquired Yirendai Ltd. (NYSE: YRD) securities between May 11, 2016 to August 24, 2016 (the “Class Period”).
The filed complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was experiencing an increasing amount of fraud related to customer applications for its loan products; (2) that the implementation of new anti-fraud regulations by the Chinese government, in response to increasing fraud in the industry, could have a negative impact on the Company’s performance; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ statements about Yirendai’s business, operations, and prospects, were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
On August 24, 2016, Bloomberg reported that China imposed limits on peer-to-peer lending, citing authorities’ concern over defaults and fraud among the nation’s 2,349 online lenders. Specifically, Bloomberg reported that under the new regulations, lenders are barred from taking public deposits or selling wealth-management products, and must appoint qualified banks as custodians and improve information disclosure. Bloomberg also reported that individual borrowing is now limited to 1 million yuan ($150,000) from peer-to-peer websites, including a maximum of 200,000 yuan from any one site.
On this news, Yirendai’s share price fell $6.92 per share, or 22%, to close at $24.52 per share on August 24, 2016, on unusually heavy trading volume.
If you acquired Yirendai Ltd. securities during the Class Period, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters please contact J. Brandon Walker, Esq. by email at investigations@bespc.com, or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out the contact form below. There is no cost or obligation to you.
