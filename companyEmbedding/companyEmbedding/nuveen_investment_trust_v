Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.



Risk Considerations
					Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. The Environmental Social Governance (ESG) criteria used to select the Trust’s portfolio excludes securities of certain issuers for nonfinancial reasons, therefore the Trust may forgo certain market opportunities. There is no guarantee that the Trust’s underlying holdings will maintain ESG characteristics over the life of the Trust. Non-U.S. investments involve additional risks, including currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity and differing legal and accounting standards. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. The Trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, recent events such as the United Kingdom’s vote to withdraw from the European Union, and the European sovereign debt crisis and related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector or country may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors or countries. This Trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information. The Trust invests in a real estate investment trust (REIT).  The real estate industry is greatly affected by economic downtowns or by changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates, tax treatment, regulations, or the legal structure of the REIT. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 

					Nuveen Securities, LLC serves as the Trust’s sponsor and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC serves as the Trust’s evaluator and supervisor.  Teachers Advisors, LLC serves as the portfolio consultant responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for the Trust.  Nuveen Securities, LLC is a registered broker-dealer and Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC and Teachers Advisors, LLC are registered investment advisers.

Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.  There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objectives.  An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them.  Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.

      institutions as well as individual investors, is pleased to announce 
      three new additions to its unit trust client sales and support platform. 
      This latest action is a reflection of the strength of and market

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its 
      investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is 
      subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values 
      of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of 
      trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. 
      Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and 
      expenses of the unit investment trust(s) carefully before investing. The 
      prospectus contains this and other information about the unit investment 
      trust(s). To obtain a prospectus, please contact your financial advisor 
      or download one at the SEC’s EDGAR filing system (sec.gov/edgar.htm) or 
      on the www.incapital.com 
      offerings page. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

I. INTRODUCTION  This Code of Ethics (�Code�) is adopted by the subsidiaries of Nuveen Investments, Inc. (�Nuveen�) identified on Schedule I hereto, as may be amended from time to time (each a �Nuveen
Subsidiary� and, together with Nuveen�s other subsidiaries, �Nuveen Investments�) in recognition of their fiduciary obligations to clients and in accordance with Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Among other things, these rules require a registered investment adviser to establish, maintain and enforce a written code of ethics that includes:  �


�
�
�
Standards of business conduct designed to reflect the adviser�s fiduciary obligations as well as those of its employees (including persons who provide investment advice on
behalf of the adviser and who are subject to the adviser�s supervision and control) 


�
�
�
Provisions requiring employees/access persons to comply with applicable federal securities laws; 


�
�
�
Provisions designed to detect and prevent improper personal trading; 


�
�
�
Provisions requiring access persons to make periodic reports of their personal securities transactions and holdings and requiring the adviser to review such reports;



�
�
�
Provisions requiring employees/access persons to report any violations under the code of ethics promptly to the chief compliance officer or other designated persons; and



�
�
�
Provisions requiring the adviser to provide to each of its employees/access persons a copy of the code of ethics and any amendments and requiring employees/access persons to provide
a written acknowledgment of receipt.  Additionally, this Code is adopted by the Nuveen Defined Portfolios and, with respect to the provisions
addressing non-interested directors (as defined in Section VIII below), by the Nuveen Open-End Funds and Closed End-Funds, pursuant to Rule 17j-1.  This
Code designates all Nuveen Investments� employees �access persons� (as defined in Section VIII below).  Each Nuveen Subsidiary, through its
compliance officers, legal officers and/or other personnel designated on Schedule II hereto (�Designated Compliance or Legal Officers�) shall be responsible for the day-to-day administration of this Code with respect to those
employees/access persons under the direct supervision and control of such Nuveen Subsidiary.  �
1 


II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  This Code is designed to promote the following general principles:  �


�
�
�
Nuveen Investments and its employees/access persons have a duty at all times to place the interests of clients first; 


�
�
�
Employees/access persons must conduct their personal securities transactions in a manner that avoids any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of their positions of
trust and responsibility; 


�
�
�
Employees/access persons may not use knowledge about pending or currently considered securities transactions for clients to profit personally; 


�
�
�
Information concerning the identity of security holdings and financial circumstances of clients is confidential; and 


�
�
�
Independence in the investment decision-making process is paramount.  III. STANDARDS OF BUSINESS CONDUCT  A. Fiduciary Standards  Nuveen Investments strives at all times to conduct its investment advisory business in strict accordance with its fiduciary obligations. It is Nuveen Investments�
policy to protect the interest of each of its clients and to place the client�s interest first and foremost. Nuveen Investments� fiduciary responsibilities include the duty of care, loyalty, honesty, and good faith. It is therefore
imperative that employees/access persons provide full and fair disclosure of all relevant facts concerning any potential or actual conflict of interest, make investment decisions and recommendations that are suitable for clients, and seek best
execution for client transactions in accordance with each Nuveen Subsidiary�s best execution policies and procedures.  B. Compliance with Laws and
Company Policies  Nuveen Investments operates in a highly regulated business environment, and has adopted many policies and procedures applicable to
the conduct of its employees/access persons, including the Nuveen Investments, Inc. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Employees/access persons must respect and comply with all laws, rules and regulations which are applicable to Nuveen Investments
in the conduct of its business. Without limiting the foregoing, it is especially important that employees/access persons comply with applicable federal securities laws, which prohibit, among other things, the following:  �
2 




�
�
�
Employing any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a client; 


�
�
�
Making any untrue statement of a material fact to a client or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make statements made to a client, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading; 


�
�
�
Engaging in any act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a client; 


�
�
�
Engaging in any manipulative practice with respect to a client; and 


�
�
�
Engaging in any manipulative practice with respect to securities, including price manipulation.  C. Conflicts of Interest  Compliance with Nuveen Investments� fiduciary obligations can be achieved by avoiding
conflicts of interest and by fully disclosing all material facts concerning any conflict that does arise with respect to a client.  Conflicts of interest
may arise, for example, when an employee or access person favors the interests of one client over another (e.g., a larger account over a smaller account, an account compensated by performance fees over an account not so compensated, or an account of
a close friend or relative) without a legitimate reason for doing so. Employees/access persons are prohibited from engaging in inappropriate favoritism among clients that would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.  Conflicts may arise when an employee or access person has a material interest in or relationship with the issuer of a security that he or she is recommending or
purchasing for a client. Conflicts may also arise when an employee or access person uses knowledge about pending or currently considered securities transactions for clients to profit personally. Restrictions on personal securities transactions are
addressed in detail in Section V below.  Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut. Any employee or access person of a Nuveen Subsidiary who
becomes aware of a conflict of interest or potential conflict involving a client account should bring it to the attention of one of the Subsidiary�s Designated Compliance or Legal Officers.  D. Gifts and Entertainment  Employees/access persons are restricted
from accepting gifts from any person or entity that does business with or on behalf of Nuveen Investments or any client account. For this purpose, �gift� has the same meaning as in Rule 2830 of the National Association of Securities
Dealers Conduct Rules. Gifts received by an employee from any one person or entity may not have an aggregate market value of more than $100 per year. Employees/access persons may not accept gifts in an amount that exceeds $100 per year 
 �
3 



from any person or entity that does business with or proposes to do business with Nuveen Investments. Employees/access persons are also subject to the
restrictions in Rule 2830 with respect to accepting and providing non-cash compensation in the way of entertainment, including meals, golfing and tickets to cultural and sporting events. Employees/access persons are similarly restricted from giving
gifts others. Employees/access persons may not give gifts in an amount that exceeds $100 per year to any person or entity that does business with or proposes to do business with Nuveen Investments. For more information, refer to Nuveen
Investments� Cash and Non-Cash Compensation Procedures.  E. Outside Directorships and Business Activities  Employees/access persons may not serve on the board of directors of any publicly traded company or engage in outside business activities without prior written approval
from the General Counsel of Nuveen Investments or his or her designee.1 Employees/access persons must also obtain
prior written approval before serving as a member of the finance or investment committee of any not-for-profit organization or performing other investment-related services for such organization. Employees/access persons are required to report all
outside business activities on a periodic basis. If it appears that any such activity conflicts with, or may reasonably be anticipated to conflict with, the interests of Nuveen Investments or its clients, the employee or access person may be
required to discontinue the activity.  F. Protection of Confidential Information  Each employee/access person of a Nuveen Subsidiary must preserve the confidentiality of non-public information learned in the course of his or her employment, including nonpublic information about Nuveen
Investments� securities recommendations and client securities holdings and transactions. Employees/access persons may not misuse such information or disclose such information, whether within or outside Nuveen Investments, except to authorized
persons who need to know the information for business purposes. Employees/access persons must comply with all laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of client information including, without limitation, Regulation S-P. Please refer to
Nuveen�s Consumer Information Security Policy for more information.  �


1
Employees/access persons who receive authorization to serve as board members of publicly traded companies must be isolated through information barriers from those
persons making investment decisions concerning securities issued by the entities involved.  �

G. Payments to Government Officials and Political Contributions  No payment can be made directly or indirectly to any employee, official or representative of any governmental agency or any party or candidate for the purposes of
influencing any act or decision on behalf of Nuveen Investments. Employees/access persons are free to participate as individuals in political activities, but are prohibited from engaging in such activities as a representative of Nuveen Investments
and from using the name or credibility of Nuveen Investments in connection with political activities. Nuveen Investments will not reimburse any employee or access person for any political contributions or similar expenses.  IV. INSIDER TRADING  Nuveen Investments has adopted
Policies and Procedures Designed to Detect and Prevent Insider Trading and to Preserve Confidential Information. These policies and procedures prohibit employees/access persons from trading, either personally or on behalf of others, on the basis of
material nonpublic information in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently referred to as �insider trading.� Nuveen Investments� policies and procedures to prevent insider trading apply to every employee/access person and
extend to activities within and outside such individual�s duties at Nuveen Investments.  A. Insider Trading  The term �insider trading� is not defined in the federal securities laws, but generally is used to refer to the use of material nonpublic information to trade
in securities (whether or not one is an �insider�) or to communications of material nonpublic information to others. While the law concerning insider trading is not static, it is generally understood that the law prohibits:  �


�
�
�
Trading by an insider while in possession of material nonpublic information; 


�
�
�
Trading by a non-insider while in possession of material nonpublic information where the information either was disclosed to the non-insider in violation of an insider�s duty
to keep it confidential or was misappropriated; and 


�
�
�
Communicating material nonpublic information to others.  B. Insider
Status  The concept of an �insider� is broad. It includes officers and employees of a company or other entity such as a municipality. In
addition, a person can be a �temporary insider� if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of a company�s affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the company�s purposes.
A temporary insider can include, among others, a company�s attorneys, accountants, 
 �
5 



consultants, bank lending officers, investment advisers and the employees of such organizations.  C. Material Nonpublic Information  Trading on inside information is
not a basis for liability unless the information is material. �Material information� generally is defined as information for which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making his or
her investment decisions, or information that is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a company�s securities. Information that officers and employees should consider material includes, but is not limited to: dividend
changes, earnings estimates, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, major litigation, liquidation problems, and extraordinary management developments. Information is nonpublic
until it has been effectively communicated to the marketplace. One must be able to point to some fact to show that the information is generally public. For example, information found in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
appearing in Dow Jones, Reuters Economic Services, The Wall Street Journal or other publications of general circulation would be considered public.  D.
Identifying Inside Information.  Before trading for yourself or others in the securities of a company about which you may have potential inside
information, ask yourself the following questions:  �


�
�
�
Is the information material? Is this information that an investor would consider important in making his or her investment decisions? Is this information that would substantially
affect the market price of the securities if generally disclosed? 


�
�
�
Is the information nonpublic? To whom has this information been provided? Has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace?  E. Reporting Suspected Inside Information.  If, after consideration
of the above, you believe that the information is material and nonpublic, or if you have questions as to whether the information is material and nonpublic, you should take the following steps:  �


�
�
�
Report the matter immediately to a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer; 


�
�
�
Do not purchase or sell the securities on behalf of yourself or others; and 


�
�
�
Do not communicate the information inside or outside of Nuveen Investments, other than to a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer.  �
6 


After a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer has reviewed the issue, you will be instructed to continue the
prohibitions against trading and communication, or you will be allowed to trade and communicate the information.  Questions regarding Nuveen
Investments� policies and procedures to prevent insider trading should be referred to a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer.  V.
PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS  Set forth below are the restrictions on personal trading applicable to employees/access persons, including
�investment persons� (as defined in Section VIII below), of each Nuveen Subsidiary. A Nuveen Subsidiary may implement more restrictive requirements for employees under its direct supervision and control by adopting supplemental procedures
under this Section V. Also included are certain restrictions that apply to the non-interested directors of the Nuveen Funds.  A. Trading Restrictions
for All Employees/Access Persons  1. Stock of Nuveen Investments, Inc. No employee/access person of any Nuveen
Subsidiary may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has �beneficial ownership� (as defined in Section VIII below), any security issued by Nuveen Investments, Inc. (�JNC�) without prior
written approval as specified in subsection G below. This requirement does apply to certain transactions in JNC securities held in Nuveen Investments� 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plan.2 This requirement also
does apply to transactions in JNC securities in accounts over which an employee/access person has granted full discretionary authority.  2. Initial Public Offerings. No employee/access person of any Nuveen Subsidiary may purchase, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any security in an �initial public offering�
(as defined in Section VIII below).  �


2
The pre-clearance requirement applies to an initial allocation to the Nuveen Stock Pooled Account in the 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plan, any subsequent changes to that
allocation, and any transfers into or out of the Nuveen Stock Pooled Account. It does not apply to transactions that occur automatically once an allocation has been made and approved.  �
7 


3. Limited Offerings. No employee/access person of any Nuveen Subsidiary may purchase, directly or
indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, or outside such an account, any security in a �limited offering� (as defined in Section VIII below) without prior written approval as specified in subsection G
below.3  4. Other Securities. No employee/access person of a Nuveen Subsidiary may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any security without first pre-clearing such transaction
through PTA (as defined in Section VIII below) as specified in subsection G below.  5. Securities Being Purchased or Sold in Client
Accounts. No employee/access person of any Nuveen Subsidiary may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any security that to his or her actual knowledge is being purchased or
sold, or is actively being considered for purchase or sale, by a client of Nuveen Investments. This restriction, however, does not apply when the purchase or sale by the client account is a �maintenance trade� or an �unsupervised
trade� (as defined in Section VIII below).  B. Additional Trading Restrictions for Investment Persons  1. Securities Eligible for Purchase or Sale by Client Accounts. Except with prior written approval, no investment person of a Nuveen
Subsidiary may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any security eligible for purchase or sale by a client account for which such investment person has responsibility.4  2. Securities
Traded Within Seven Days Before or After a Client Transaction. In the event that a client account purchases or sells a security within 7 days preceding or following the purchase, or purchases or sells a security within 7 days preceding or
following the sale, of the same security by an investment person who has responsibility for the client account, the investment person may be required to dispose of the security and/or disgorge any profits associated with his or her transaction. Such
disposal and/or disgorgement may be required notwithstanding any prior written approval granted  �


3
A decision to grant approval will take into account, among other factors, whether the investment opportunity would be consistent with the strategies and objectives
of a client account and whether the opportunity is being offered to the access person by virtue of his or her position with Nuveen Investments.  �


4
 Written approval may be withheld unless it is determined that the transaction is unlikely to present an opportunity for abuse and there has been no
trade (other than a maintenance trade or unsupervised trade) in the same security during the 7 preceding days by a client account for which the investment person has some responsibility. 
 �
8 



pursuant to paragraph B.1 above, unless the purchase or sale by the client account is a maintenance trade or unsupervised trade.  C. Other Trading Restrictions  1. Transactions in
Common Shares of Certain Closed-End Funds and Similar Pooled Vehicles. No employee of a Nuveen Subsidiary either (a)�working in the Chicago office or (b)�working in Nuveen�s Closed-End Funds and Structured Products Group
(or any successor group) may purchase or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any common shares of a Nuveen Closed-End Fund (as defined in Section VIII below) or other closed-end fund advised or
sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary without prior written approval as specified in Subsection G below. This pre-clearance requirement will also apply to common shares of any other exchange-listed investment product sponsored by Nuveen that is not a
closed-end fund, such as the Nuveen Commodities Income and Growth Fund, and such product will be regarded as a Closed-End Fund for purposes of this Section V.C. and all related sections. In addition, no employee, officer or director of any Nuveen
Subsidiary who is subject to the provisions of Section�16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by reason of his or her position with a Nuveen Closed-End Fund or other closed-end fund advised or sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary may purchase
or sell, directly or indirectly for any account in which he or she has beneficial ownership, any common shares of such fund without prior written approval as specified in Subsection G below. These restrictions do apply to any such
transactions in accounts over which an employee/access person has granted full discretionary authority.  2. Non-Interested Directors of
the Nuveen Funds. A non-interested director of a Nuveen Fund is deemed an �access person� of the Fund under Rule 17j-1. Accordingly, in connection with his or her purchase or sale of a security held or to be acquired by the Fund, such
non-interested director may not: engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon the Fund; make any material misstatement or omission to the Fund; or engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund. Under this
Code, a non-interested director of a Nuveen Fund:  �


�
�
�
May not purchase or sell common shares of a Nuveen Closed-End Fund without prior written approval; 


�
�
�
May not purchase any security issued by JNC; 


�
�
�
May purchase or sell other securities which are eligible for purchase or sale by a Nuveen Fund, including securities in an initial public offering or limited offering, without prior
written approval unless such non-interested director has actual knowledge that the securities are being purchased or sold, or are actively being considered for purchase or sale, by the Nuveen Fund.  �
9 


3. Frequent Trading in Shares of Certain Open-End Funds. Employees/access persons of each Nuveen
Subsidiary must adhere to the restrictions on frequent trading set forth in the registration statement of any Nuveen Open-End Fund (as defined in Section VIII below) and any other open-end fund advised or sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary.
 4. Excessive or Abusive Trading. Excessive personal trading (as measured in terms of frequency, complexity of trading
programs, numbers of trades or other measures) and other personal trading patterns that involve opportunities for abuse are inconsistent with fiduciary principles and this Code. Accordingly, if the trading by an employee or access person in any
account, including but not limited to a 401(k) plan, appears to be excessive or otherwise abusive, the Designated Compliance or Legal Officers of the applicable Nuveen Subsidiary may place additional restrictions on such trading.  D. PTA System and Employee/Access Person Trade Monitoring  1. PTA. PTA is Nuveen�s pre-clearance monitoring system for employee/access person transactions. All personal transactions for such individuals must be pre-cleared through PTA. This means that all transactions must be
input into PTA for approval before any such transactions are executed. All of the information required by PTA must be supplied in connection with the transaction. Employees/access persons will receive training for PTA. Transactions effected
pursuant to an �automatic investment plan� (as defined in Section VIII below) must only be submitted for pre-clearance one time, prior to the first transaction under the automatic investment plan. The following trades are not required to
be submitted to PTA for pre-clearance:  �


�
a.
Purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to the extent such rights were acquired from
such issuers, and sales of such rights so acquired;  �


�
b.
Acquisitions of securities through stock dividends, dividend reinvestments, stock splits, reverse stock splits, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs, and other similar
corporate reorganizations or distributions generally applicable to all holders of the same class of securities; and  �


�
c.
Transactions that are non-volitional on the part of the access person, including transactions in managed accounts in which the employee/access person has no investment
discretion and the call by a third party of an option on securities owned by the access person.  �
10 


2. Employee/Access persons Accounts. Employees/access persons must maintain all brokerage
accounts at a PTA compatible broker-dealer. This includes all brokerage accounts for the employee/access person�s family members living in their home, the brokerage accounts of any domestic partner and any other brokerage account over which the
employee/access person has discretionary authority. The PTA compatible broker-dealers are listed on Schedule IV and may be updated from time to time by the Compliance Department. Certain accounts itemized in section D.3 below are excluded from this
requirement. Accounts that enable the employee/access person to engage in any transaction not specifically listed in Section D.3 below cannot be excluded and must be maintained at a PTA compatible broker-dealer.  3. Accounts That May be Maintained at Non-PTA Compatible Broker-Dealers. Employees/access persons may maintain accounts at broker-dealers
that are not listed on Schedule IV when the account in question only allows for transactions in any or all of the following categories:  a.
Transactions in securities over which a person has no direct or indirect influence or control;5  b. Transactions in securities issued by the U.S. Government, bankers� acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and high-quality
short-term debt instruments, including repurchase agreements;  c. Transactions in shares of registered open-end investment companies,
including open-end exchange-traded funds known as �ETFs� (other than the restrictions on frequent trading in shares of Nuveen Open-End Funds and other open-end funds advised or sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary);  d. Transactions in ETFs that are comparable to open-end ETFs but are formed as unit investment trusts; and  e. Transactions in shares of unit investment trusts that are invested exclusively in one or more registered open-end investment companies.  A Designated Compliance or Legal Officers may grant other exceptions on a limited case-by-case basis. The person seeking such exemption must make a request to the
Designated Compliance or Legal Officers and must receive prior written approval in writing before the exemption becomes effective. (See Section G below for approval process.)  �


5
This would include securities transactions in accounts over which a person has granted full discretionary authority to another party that does not have beneficial
ownership in the securities, such as a separately managed account for which a third party has full and exclusive discretion, provided that the Designated Compliance or Legal Officers receive written notice of such grant of authority. Note that such
grant of discretionary authority must be restricted as to JNC securities. Employees/access persons may not grant discretion to another party for purchases or sales of JNC securities which always require prior approval by legal as specified in
Subsection G below.  �
11 


E. Reporting Requirements  1. General Reporting Requirements. Nuveen Investments will deliver a copy of this Code, and amendments to this Code, to each employee/access person of a Nuveen Subsidiary. Shortly after receipt of a copy of

Agrees that he or she is legally bound by the Code; and 


�
�
�
Will comply with all requirements of the Code.  2.
Initial Holdings Report. Each access person of a Nuveen Subsidiary must submit through PTA a report of all holdings in securities within 10 days of becoming an access person. The report must include the following information current as

�
�
�

�
�
�
Name of any broker, dealer or bank with which the access person maintains an account; and 


�
�
�
Date on which the report is submitted.  3. Annual

 �


�
�
�
Title, type, exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, number of shares and principal amount of each security; 


�
�
�
Name of any broker, dealer or bank with which the access person maintains an account; and 


�
�
�
Date on which the report is submitted.  4. Quarterly
Transaction Reports. Access persons must submit through PTA transaction reports no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter covering all transactions in securities during the quarter. The report must include:  �


�
�
�
Date of transaction, title, exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity date (if applicable), number of shares and principal amount of each security involved;



�
�
�
Nature of the transaction (e.g., purchase, sale or any other acquisition or disposition);  �
12 




�
�
�
Price at which the transaction was effected; 


�
�
�
Name of broker, dealer, or bank through which the transaction was effected; 


�
�
�
Name of broker, dealer or bank with whom any new account was established and the date such account was established; and 


�
�
�
Date on which the report is submitted.  5. Transaction
Reports of Non-Interested Nuveen Fund Directors. Non-interested directors of a Nuveen Fund must report a personal securities transaction only if such director, at the time of that transaction, knew that during the 15-day period
immediately preceding or subsequent to the date of the transaction by the director, such security was purchased or sold by the Fund or was being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund. Non-interested directors must report securities
transactions meeting these requirements within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter.  6. Reporting Holdings and Transactions
in Certain Open-End Funds. Unless one of the exceptions set forth in Section G below applies, holdings and transactions in shares of Nuveen Open-End Funds, and shares of any other open-end fund for which a Nuveen Subsidiary serves as an adviser
or sub-adviser, must be included in the initial and annual holdings reports and quarterly transaction reports required by this Section E. See Schedule III for a list of such funds. However, employees/access persons need not take any action to report
holdings or transactions in shares of Nuveen Open-End Funds through the Nuveen Investments 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plan because such information is being directly provided by the plan administrator to the Designated Compliance or Legal Officers.
 7. Brokerage Statements. Each employee/access must provide the Designated Legal and Compliance Officers with a list of their
brokerage accounts (or other accounts that hold securities). This requirement also includes accounts held directly with any Nuveen Open-End Fund or other open-end fund advised or sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary, unless one of the exceptions in
Section F below applies. With respect to transactions in the Nuveen Investments 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plan, this requirement is deemed satisfied by virtue of the reports being sent by the plan administrator directly to the Legal and Compliance
Department.  8. Form of Holdings and Transaction Reports. An employee/access person�s holdings and transaction reports required
by this Section E shall be in the form required to be reported in PTA, or such other form approved by the Designated Compliance or Legal Officers.  �
13 


F. Exceptions to Reporting Requirements  The following holdings and/or transactions are not required to be included in the reports described in Section E above:  �


�
1.
Holdings and transactions in securities over which a person has no direct or indirect influence or control;

unless such transactions override or deviate from the pre-set schedule or allocations of such automatic investment plan; 


�
3.
Holdings and transactions in securities issued by the U.S. Government, bankers� acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and high-quality short-term debt
instruments, including repurchase agreements;

(ETFs); and 


�
5.
Holdings and transactions in shares of unit investment trusts that are invested exclusively in one or more open-end funds that are not advised or sub-advised by a Nuveen Subsidiary.
 G. Procedures  1.
Notification of Status as Investment Person. Nuveen Investments will notify each person who is considered to be an investment person under this Code.  2. Maintenance of Access Person Master List. Each Nuveen Subsidiary will maintain and update an access person master list containing the names of its access persons and investment persons who are subject to
this Code. It will also maintain a list of all open-end funds for which any Nuveen Subsidiary serves as an adviser or sub-adviser.  3.
Procedure for Requesting Prior Written Approval. A request for prior written approval required by Sections A(1), A(3) and C(1) above must be made in writing (including by e-mail) to a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer of the applicable
Nuveen Subsidiary. Such requests must include the following information:  �


�
�
�
Title, ticker symbol or CUSIP number; 


�
�
�
Type of security (bond, stock, note, etc.); 


�
�
�
Maximum expected dollar amount or number of shares of proposed transaction; 


�
�
�
Nature of the transaction (purchase or sale); and 


�
�
�
Broker�s name and account number; and  �
14 




�
�
�
Any other information, representations or certifications that a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer may reasonably request.  The person granting approval of a transaction will create an e-mail or other written record setting forth the terms of the approval and will copy the other
employees/access persons who need to know such information.  The person making the request will have one business day to execute an approved
transaction at market or to place or cancel a limit order. Failure to execute the approved transaction within one business day will require the person to re-submit their pre-clearance request as described above. The automatic execution of an
order does not require an additional approval.  4. Monitoring of Personal Securities Transactions. Designated Compliance or
Legal Officers will review personal securities transactions and holdings reports periodically, either on a trade-by-trade basis or through various sampling techniques.  5. Pre-Clearance Through PTA. Employees/access persons are required to use PTA Connect, the electronic monitoring system adopted by Nuveen Investments to pre-clear personal securities transactions in accordance
with Section V (D)�above.�All�employees/access persons will be given computer based�training on the procedures to be used�within�the PTA Connect system. VI. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT  A. Approval of Code  This Code has been approved by each Nuveen Subsidiary identified on Schedule I hereto, the principal underwriter or depositor of the Nuveen Defined Portfolios, the board
of directors of the Nuveen Open-End and Closed-End Funds, and the board of directors or trustees of other funds for which a Nuveen Subsidiary serves as an adviser or sub-adviser. Material amendments must also be approved by such fund boards (or
principal underwriter or depositor in the case of a unit investment trust) within six months of the amendment.  B. Reporting to the Nuveen Fund Board
 Nuveen Investments or the applicable Nuveen Subsidiary must provide an annual written report to the board of directors of any Nuveen Fund or other
fund (other than a unit investment trust) for which a Nuveen Subsidiary serves as an adviser or sub-adviser. The report must:  �
15

procedures thereunder and sanctions imposed in response to such violations; and 


�
�
�
Certify that procedures have been adopted that are reasonably necessary to prevent access persons from violating the Code.  C. Duty to Report Violations  Employees/access persons must report
violations of the Code promptly to a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer of the applicable Nuveen Subsidiary, who in turn must report all such violations to such Subsidiary�s Chief Compliance Officer. Such reports will be treated
confidentially to the extent permitted by law and investigated promptly.  D. Sanctions for Violation of the Code  Employees/access persons may be subject to sanctions for violations of the specific provisions or general principles of the Code. Violations by such persons will be
reviewed and sanctions determined by the General Counsel of Nuveen Investments, the Director of Compliance and the Chief Compliance Officer of the applicable Nuveen Subsidiary, or their designee(s). Sanctions which may be imposed include:

Restriction of trading privileges; 


�
�
�

�
�
�
Extent of unjust enrichment;

16 


Material violations by non-interested directors of a Nuveen Fund may be reviewed and sanctions determined by the other
non-interested directors of such Fund or a committee thereof.  E. Form ADV Disclosure  Each Nuveen Subsidiary that is an investment adviser must include on Schedule F of Part II of its Form ADV a description of the Code and a statement that such Nuveen Subsidiary will provide a copy of the Code to any
client or prospective client upon request.  F. Interpretation of the Code and the Granting of Waivers  Questions concerning the interpretation or applicability of the provisions of this Code, and the granting of waivers or exceptions hereunder, may be determined and made
by the General Counsel of Nuveen Investments, the Director of Compliance, the Chief Compliance Officer of the applicable Nuveen Subsidiary, or their designees.  VII. RECORDKEEPING  Nuveen Investments will maintain the following records in a readily accessible place in
accordance with Rule 17j-1(f) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  �


�
�
�
A copy of each Code that has been in effect at any time during the past five years; 


�
�
�
A record of any violation of the Code and any action taken as a result of such violation for five years from the end of the fiscal year in which the violation occurred;



�
�
�
A record of all written acknowledgements of receipt of the Code and amendments for each person who is currently, or within the past five years was, an access person;



�
�
�
Holdings and transactions reports made pursuant to the Code, including any brokerage confirmation and account statements made in lieu of these reports; 


�
�
�
A list of the names of persons who are currently, or within the past five years were, access persons; 


�
�
�
A record of any decision and supporting reasons for approving the acquisition of securities by access persons in initial public offerings or limited offerings for at least five
years after the end of the fiscal year in which approval was granted; 


�
�
�
Any decisions that grant employees/access persons a waiver from or exception to the Code;  �
17 




�
�
�
A record of persons responsible for reviewing access persons� reports currently or during the last five years; and 


�
�
�
A copy of reports provided to a fund�s board of directors regarding the Code.  VIII. DEFINITIONS  A. Access Person  Effective November, 2006, all Nuveen Investments employees will be considered �access persons�. This standard is more restrictive than Rule 204A-1(e)(1) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940and Rule
17j-1(a)(2) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  B. Automatic Investment Plan  �Automatic investment plan� means a program in which regular periodic purchases (or withdrawals) are made automatically in (or from) investment accounts in accordance with a predetermined schedule and
allocation. An automatic investment plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan.  C. Beneficial Ownership  �Beneficial ownership� means having or sharing a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a security through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship or otherwise. The term �pecuniary interest� means the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities. See Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The pecuniary interest standard looks beyond the record owner of securities. As a result, the definition of beneficial ownership is very broad and encompasses many situations that might not ordinarily be thought to
confer a �pecuniary interest� in, or �ownership� of, securities, including the following:  �


�
�
�
Family Holdings. As a general rule, you are regarded as the beneficial owner of securities not only in your name but held in the name of members of your immediate
family, including: your spouse or domestic partner; your child or other relative who shares your home or, although not living in your home, is economically dependent upon you; or any other person if you obtain from such securities benefits
substantially similar to those of ownership. 


�
�
�
 Partnership and Corporate Holdings. A general partner of a general or limited partnership will generally be deemed to beneficially own securities held
by the partnership, so long as the partner has direct or indirect influence or control over the management and affairs of the partnership. A limited partner will generally not be deemed to beneficially own securities held by a limited partnership,
provided he or she does not own a controlling voting interest in 
 �
18 




�
 
the partnership. If a corporation is your �alter ego� or �personal holding company,� the corporation�s holdings of securities will
be attributable to you. 


�
�
�
Investment Clubs. You are deemed to beneficially own securities held by an investment club of which you or a member of your immediate family (as defined above) is a
member. Membership in investment clubs must be pre-approved by a Designated Compliance or Legal Officer . 


�
�
�
Trusts. You are deemed to beneficially own securities held in trust if any of the following is true: you are a trustee and either you or members of your immediate
family (as defined above) have a monetary interest in the trust, whether as to principal or income; you have a vested beneficial interest in the trust; or you are settlor of the trust and you have the power to revoke the trust without obtaining the
consent of all the beneficiaries. See Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 


�
�
�
Financial Power of Attorney. You are deemed to beneficially own securities held in any account over which you have financial power of attorney. 
 D. Control  �Control� of a

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.

The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan

View transcript





Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

Tell us your current age and how old you think you'll be when you retire.

 How long might that last?  



 Back 





How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 What now?  


There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME


You're already challenged to generate retirement income that could last 20 or 30 years. But if you're a surviving spouse or partner, you may also have to replace the loss of expected income, which could include Social Security and pension benefits.
















See how we can help  >




The Impact of
INCOME
TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.



























See how we can help  >
You should consult with your tax advisors regarding your personal circumstances.




Medicare Premiums
AND HEALTH
EXPENSES


At age 65, Social Security payments are reduced to cover premiums for Medicare Parts B and D and Medigap insurance. Then there are health-care costs not covered by Medicare — which could average $220,000 for a 65-year-old couple.

The Cost of
MAINTAINING
QUALITY OF LIFE


As you get older, you might be thinking about both providing a death benefit for your loved ones, and protecting your finances if you face health issues. The costs associated with a chronic illness-from paying for care to hiring help for your household needs-could impact your nest egg in retirement. Find solutions that can help you protect your family and your retirement.

Help Ensure

Life insurance helps give your family peace of mind if you should die prematurely. But now, it can also help provide more financial security during your retirement, if an unexpected illness happens. A financial professional can show you how.

Delay
Social Security


Consider whether beginning Social Security before your Full Retirement Age (FRA)   is your best option. For some, delaying benefits until at age 66 instead of taking them at 62 could result in 25% higher payments. A guarantee income solution can provide added cash flow while you wait.

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
