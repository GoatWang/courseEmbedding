Frequently Asked Questions
How do I send text messages? 

Each cellphone works slightly differently. 
Check the instructions that came with your cellphone to determine how to send 
text messages from your device. In general, you may follow these directions for 
sending a text message to use the text commands. 
Start a new text message in your cellphone or 
PDA. 
1. Enter the text-to number 368374, then press "OK" or enter. 
2. Next, enter "bal" (without quotes), or any other eligible text command. 
3. Press "send". You'll receive a reply and/or other instructions. 
4. Click here for a demo that shows how the messages look on a basic cellphone.

What other commands can I text to myACCOUNT from my registered phone? 
You can: 

Assign a nickname (e.g., "home") to your

How much does it cost? 
myACCOUNT is offered at no charge by 
Entergy Texas, Inc. However, message and data rates may apply. Your cellphone provider may bill you for text messages 
received and sent with this service. Entergy Texas is 
not responsible for these charges. Before using myACCOUNT, check with 
your cellphone service provider for text message costs and plans. 
Can Entergy Texas guarantee delivery of text messages?
Entergy Texas cannot guarantee delivery of text messages. Your 
cellphone 
wireless carrier is responsible for transmitting text messages. Text message 
delivery may be limited by your cellphone plan or your provider's wireless 
coverage area. 
Your cellphone must be "on" to receive text 
messages in a timely manner. From time to time, myACCOUNT may be 
unavailable and text messages cannot be sent by us. This could result in 
undelivered or untimely text messages. 
What if my cellphone number changes?
You must keep your cellphone number up-to-date 
in myACCOUNT. If your cellphone number changes, or if your Entergy 
Texas electric account number 
changes, register your new cellphone number to your electric account. 

What happens during widespread outage 
situations? 
myACCOUNT is intended for use during 
normal weather and operating conditions. During times of widespread outages or 
emergency situations (e.g., hurricanes, ice storms), Entergy Texas focuses resources on power recovery. In such 
situations, myACCOUNT messages may be regional in nature or delayed, 
or both. In times of weather disasters (e.g., hurricanes, ice storms, etc.), 
outage and transaction text messages may not be deliverable. 
Will the text message guarantee that my 
house has power? 
A message that power is restored to your area 
does not guarantee your house/business has power. Restoration times are 
estimates only. We cannot restore power to structures that are not capable of 
receiving service due to damage or other causes.
