Seidel’s Guide to Physical Examination, 8th Edition-Jane W. Ball-Test bank
SAMPLE
Chapter 04: Vital Signs and Pain Assessment
Test Bank—Nursing
MULTIPLE CHOICE
 1. The pyrexia response is triggered by the production and release of:




a.


prostaglandins.




b.


endogenous pyrogens.




c.


hypothalamic enzymes.




d.


thyroid hormones.




ANS: A
When microorganisms invade the body, pyrogens are released and travel to the hypothalamus. The pyrexia response is then triggered by the production and release of prostaglandins.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Understanding (Comprehension) REF: p. 50
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 2. During respiration, the internal intercostals:




a.


increase the force of muscular contraction.




b.


decrease the lateral diameter during expiration.




c.


decrease the intrathoracic space.




d.


increase elastic recoil during expiration.




ANS: B
The diaphragm is the dominant muscle during respiration. It contracts and pushes downward during inspiration to increase the intrathoracic space. The external intercostal muscles increase the AP diameter during inspiration and the internal intercostals decrease the lateral diameter during expiration.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Understanding (Comprehension) REF: p. 50
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 3. The fifth vital sign is:




a.


pain.




b.


orientation.




c.


waist-to-hip ratio.




d.


body mass index (BMI).




ANS: A
Pain, the universal distress signal, is now recognized as the fifth vital sign.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Remembering (Knowledge) REF: p. 50
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 4. The Joint Commission (TJC) requires that:




a.


pain be assessed on all discharges.




b.


repeated assessment of pain be limited to those patients who complain of pain.




c.


repeated intensity documentation be made of the course of pain relief for all patients.




d.


pain be assessed on surgical patients.




ANS: C
TJC requires pain assessment on all admissions, repeated assessments for pain regardless of the initial complaint or surgical experience, and repeated intensity documentation of the course of pain relief for all patients.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Understanding (Comprehension) REF: p. 50
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 5. The perception of pain:




a.


is the same across cultures.




b.


can be easily assessed in neonates.




c.


is predictable with the same circumstances.




d.


is affected by emotions and quality of sleep.




ANS: D
The perception of pain is variable and is affected by emotions, cultural background, sleep deprivation, previous pain experience, and age. Perception of pain is different among different cultures. Neonates do feel pain, but perception of pain cannot be assessed in neonates. Each circumstance will provide different pain perception.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Understanding (Comprehension) REF: p. 51
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 6. The nurse assesses the blood pressure to be 140/62 mm Hg and records 78 as the:




a.


pulse pressure.




b.


pulse deficit.




c.


afterload.




d.


preload.




ANS: A
Systolic pressure – diastolic pressure = pulse pressure.
Pulse deficit occurs when the number of pulse beats counted at the radial pulse is less than those counted at the same time at the heart. Afterload and preload are not measured according to blood pressures.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) REF: p. 50
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential
 7. Hypertension in the adult is generally defined as pressure in excess of:




a.


120 mm Hg plus the patient’s age.




b.


140 mm Hg.




c.


160 mm Hg.




d.


200 mm Hg.




ANS: B
Optimal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg. According to JNC7, hypertension continues to be defined as 140/90 mm Hg and higher. Prehypertension is the range between optimal and hypertension. The equation that systolic blood pressure should be less than 120 mm Hg plus the patient’s age is no longer the acceptable definition.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Remembering (Knowledge) REF: p. 54
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Reduction of Risk Potential
 8. A blood pressure cuff bladder should be long enough to:




a.


cover 20% to 25% of the arm circumference.




b.


cover 45% to 50% of the arm circumference.




c.


cover 75% to 80% of the arm circumference.




d.


completely encircle the arm.




ANS: C
The length of the cuff bladder should be twice its width, or about 75% to 80% of the limb circumference.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Remembering (Knowledge) REF: p. 54
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 9. If a sufficiently large cuff is unavailable to fit an obese arm, which technique may be used to assess blood pressure?




a.


Wrap a standard cuff around the deltoid area and place the stethoscope over the radial artery.




b.


Wrap a standard cuff around the forearm and place the stethoscope over the radial artery.




c.


Wrap a standard cuff around the thigh and place the stethoscope on the dorsalis pedis.




d.


Wrap a pediatric cuff around the ankle and place the stethoscope on the popliteal artery.




ANS: B
A technique to use when assessing the blood pressure of an obese person and you only have a standard adult cuff is to wrap the cuff around the smaller forearm, and place the stethoscope over the radial artery. This substitution should comply with the cuff standard of one third to one half of the circumference of the limb. The cuff should be wrapped around the forearm, not the deltoid or thigh areas. A pediatric cuff will not fit the ankle.

 10. Postural hypotension is defined as a ___________________ when the patient stands compared with sitting or supine readings.




a.


systolic pressure drop of more than 15 mm Hg with a pulse rate increase




b.


pulse rate decrease with a systolic pressure increase of at least 15 mm Hg




c.


diastolic pressure increase of more than 5 mm Hg and no pulse rate changes




d.


pulse rate decrease and diastolic pressure decrease of more than 5 mm Hg




ANS: A
Postural hypotension (orthostatic hypotension) represents a significant decrease in systolic pressure greater than 15 mm Hg, an accompanied drop in diastolic pressure, and a rise in pulse rate whenever the position changes from sitting to standing.

 11. The most frequent cause of serious hypertension in children is:




a.


heart disease.




b.


liver failure.




c.


renal disease.




d.


rheumatic fever.




ANS: C
If the systolic blood pressure is elevated and the diastolic blood pressure is not, anxiety may be responsible. Blood pressure in children varies by gender and height at any age. Hypertension in children is becoming more common because of the increased prevalence of overweight children. Usually, hypertension is caused by kidney disease, renal arterial disease, coarctation of the aorta, and pheochromocytoma, not heart disease, liver failure, or rheumatic fever.

 12. Underestimation of blood pressure will occur if the cuff’s width covers:




a.


less than half of the upper arm.




b.


less than 5 inches of the lower arm.




c.


more than two thirds of the upper arm.




d.


more than 4 inches of the lower arm.




ANS: C
Cuffs that are too wide will underestimate blood pressure, which would occur with a cuff that covers more than two thirds of the upper arm.

 13. Your 85-year-old patient is complaining of right knee pain. She has a history of osteoarthritis, for which she is given antiinflammatory medication. To assess her right knee pain, you should ask her if:




a.


the current pain is similar to previous pain.




b.


the left knee hurts as well.




c.


she took pain medication last night.




d.


the pain gets better when she sits.




ANS: C
It is most appropriate to ask a present tense evaluation question, such as whether the patient took her pain medication; the question should be simply worded, without the addition of multiple factors to consider. You should refrain from asking older patients to compare past with present symptoms because recollection may be uncertain and recollection of past pain is sometimes not readily achieved. Systematic evaluation of the right knee should be completed before any additional symptoms are evaluated. Knowing that the pain gets better when she sits does not help assess the right knee pain.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Applying (Application) REF: p. 56
OBJ: Nursing process—assessment MSC: Physiologic Integrity: Physiologic Adaptation
 14. Body language that leads you to suspect that a person is in pain is:




a.


talkative, verbose speech.




b.


fretful hand movements.




c.


focused, fixed eye stares.




d.


marked salivation.




ANS: B
The person in pain may suddenly become quiet, have an inability to keep the hands still, and have lackluster eyes, pallor, diaphoresis, pupil dilation, and dry mouth.
DIF: Cognitive Level: Analyzing (Analysis) REF: p. 56

 15. Ms. Green is an 85-year-old female patient with dementia who presents to the emergency department with her daughter because of a change in function. Which pain assessment scale would be the best choice?




a.


Oucher Scale




b.


Checklist for Nonverbal Pain Indicators




c.


Wong/Baker Rating Scale




d.


CRIES Scale




ANS: B
The Checklist for Nonverbal Pain Indicators is for nonverbal adults. The Oucher and Wong/Baker Rating Scales are pediatric scales. The CRIES Scale is for infants.
