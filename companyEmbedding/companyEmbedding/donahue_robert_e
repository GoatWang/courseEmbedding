					About	

HomeAbout 






A leading architect in New Jersey
Robert Donahue is a Registered Architect in New Jersey (and New Hampshire) with over sixteen years of experience. But his dedication to being one of the premier architects in New Jersey goes well beyond just creating beautiful designs. He has a true passion for architecture and a deep dedication to his customers. No problem is too big, and no detail too small. Robert is someone you can trust to always do the job right. Which is exactly why when a project requires a true expert, clients and industry peers turn to Robert.
Robert’s experience includes the design and preparation of construction documents, as well as project management and construction administration for educational, hospitality, commercial, healthcare, residential, retail, and corporate facilities at locations throughout the country. Robert also has Construction Management and Forensic Architecture experience across various project types.
Thanks to his diverse experience as an architect in New Jersey and beyond, Robert has the unique ability to plan, design, and manage the construction of highly complex projects. He also serves as a technical consultant for a wide range of both public and private clients, offering forensic architectural consulting and professional opinions.
His clients include:

Education boards
Private colleges
Private companies
Retail companies
Private residential clients

For Robert, design is more than just a profession. It's a passion.

Robert’s passion for detail and design has not only helped him build a successful architectural firm, but also a serious affinity for boatbuilding and boat design. He has built many small crafts and is constantly experimenting with small boat designs and construction techniques. Certain techniques he uses in boat construction are often employed in his architectural designs.

My condolences to the Donahue family. I was out of town last week and just learned of Robert's passing. When I sold advertising for the Daily Tribune in Wisconsin Rapids in the early 1980's, Bob Sr. always made time for me. He always listened to my sales proposition and helped me to develop my sales ability by asking questions about the value of my offers to his business. And, more often than not, he bought some ad space. He also appreciated my willingness and ability to write and design his ads. (Not many of my clients did.) He was truly a nice guy and a sharp businessman. It was an honor to know the man.

consistently delivered a clear vision with precise direction and prime source material including scripting, examples and ready access to experts. His project management skills consistently saved time and cost, allowing us to deliver our best work while remaining within budget. He remains one of the very finest clients I've ever had the pleasure to work with in my 28 year history at HyperActive.Mehr anzeigenWeniger anzeigenFocused on revenue growth, Bob is a passionate, creative and detailed orientated marketing communications professional with a high work ethic. I learned a lot from the campaigns he created that have essential grown the GE Transportation brand across the globe. I had the honour of working with Bob while at a former employer (alliance partner of GE Transportation in Australia). We collaborated on multiple campaigns that raised the profile of both companies in the locomotive market space. A joint project included the soft launch of a new lower emitting, fuel efficient narrow gauge locomotive at AusRail 2011.
