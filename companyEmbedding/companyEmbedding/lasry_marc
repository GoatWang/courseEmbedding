Distressed asset specialist Marc Lasry: 'We're short retail'

            Marc Lasry: Opportunity in distressed retail sector   
			                        Wednesday, 22 Mar 2017 |  8:31  AM ET |  02:33 




The issues facing retailers are "just too big," and those stocks should see more downside, the billionaire co-founder of Avenue Capital told CNBC on Wednesday.
"We're short retail," Marc Lasry said, declining to answer a direct question about whether he's short Sears. "I don't know if my compliance department will allow me to" say either way.
Shares of Sears were tanking about 13 percent Wednesday morning, a day after the troubled retailer warned about its ability to stay afloat.

The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States, but the company has been unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart and Target, not to mention Amazon.
"The issues you're having on the retail side [overall] are just too big," Lasry said. "You're going to see a lot of equity value go down."
"You'll have value to these companies, but it's going to be a lot less than people think. So therefore you want to be in that debt," argued the chairman and CEO of Avenue Capital, which has about $10.7 billion in assets under management.
Major investment companies can make a lot of money betting on the debt of companies that have filed for bankruptcy or are likely to file. If the once-troubled company were able to emerge from bankruptcy, then the holder of the debt could see value soar.
In Wednesday's "Squawk Box" appearance,  Lasry also talked about the overall stock market. While standing by his January prediction on CNBC for a 10 percent gain in the S&P 500 this year, he warned that the Trump rally could falter in 2018 as hopes for 3 percent GDP fail to turn into reality.
— Reuters contributed to this report.

Early life and education[edit]
Lasry was born in Marrakech to a family of Moroccan Jews.[3] When he was seven years old, he and his family immigrated to the U.S.[4] His father, Moise, was a computer programmer and his mother, Elise, was a schoolteacher.[5][6] Lasry grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and received a B.A. in history from Clark University in 1981 and a J.D. from New York Law School in 1984. While in law school, he worked as a clerk for the Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Southern District of New York, Edward Ryan.[7]
Career[edit]
After graduating from law school, Lasry took a position in the bankruptcy branch of the law firm Angel & Frankel.[7] Together with his sister Sonia Gardner, they founded Amroc Investments in 1989 and Avenue Capital Group in 1995. One year later[7] Lasry became the director of the private debt department at the investment firm R. D. Smith, now Smith Vasillou Management.[8] This is where Lasry first got involved in trade claims. He then took a position as Co-Director of the Bankruptcy and Corporate Reorganization Department at Cowen & Company.[8] There Lasry recruited his sister Sonia Gardner, also an attorney, to assist in the company's trade claims department.[8] Lasry left Cowen & Company and joined the Robert M. Bass Group, focused on distressed security investments.
In 1989, Lasry and his sister founded the firm Amroc Investments with $100 million in seed money from various investors. Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

Early life and education[edit]
Lasry was born in Marrakech to a family of Moroccan Jews.[3] When he was seven years old, he and his family immigrated to the U.S.[4] His father, Moise, was a computer programmer and his mother, Elise, was a schoolteacher.[5][6] Lasry grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and received a B.A. in history from Clark University in 1981 and a J.D. from New York Law School in 1984. While in law school, he worked as a clerk for the Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Southern District of New York, Edward Ryan.[7]
Career[edit]
After graduating from law school, Lasry took a position in the bankruptcy branch of the law firm Angel & Frankel.[7] Together with his sister Sonia Gardner, they founded Amroc Investments in 1989 and Avenue Capital Group in 1995. One year later[7] Lasry became the director of the private debt department at the investment firm R. D. Smith, now Smith Vasillou Management.[8] This is where Lasry first got involved in trade claims. He then took a position as Co-Director of the Bankruptcy and Corporate Reorganization Department at Cowen & Company.[8] There Lasry recruited his sister Sonia Gardner, also an attorney, to assist in the company's trade claims department.[8] Lasry left Cowen & Company and joined the Robert M. Bass Group, focused on distressed security investments.
In 1989, Lasry and his sister founded the firm Amroc Investments with $100 million in seed money from various investors. Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

Early life and education[edit]
Lasry was born in Marrakech to a family of Moroccan Jews.[3] When he was seven years old, he and his family immigrated to the U.S.[4] His father, Moise, was a computer programmer and his mother, Elise, was a schoolteacher.[5][6] Lasry grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and received a B.A. in history from Clark University in 1981 and a J.D. from New York Law School in 1984. While in law school, he worked as a clerk for the Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Southern District of New York, Edward Ryan.[7]
Career[edit]
After graduating from law school, Lasry took a position in the bankruptcy branch of the law firm Angel & Frankel.[7] Together with his sister Sonia Gardner, they founded Amroc Investments in 1989 and Avenue Capital Group in 1995. One year later[7] Lasry became the director of the private debt department at the investment firm R. D. Smith, now Smith Vasillou Management.[8] This is where Lasry first got involved in trade claims. He then took a position as Co-Director of the Bankruptcy and Corporate Reorganization Department at Cowen & Company.[8] There Lasry recruited his sister Sonia Gardner, also an attorney, to assist in the company's trade claims department.[8] Lasry left Cowen & Company and joined the Robert M. Bass Group, focused on distressed security investments.
In 1989, Lasry and his sister founded the firm Amroc Investments with $100 million in seed money from various investors. Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

Early life and education[edit]
Lasry was born in Marrakech to a family of Moroccan Jews.[3] When he was seven years old, he and his family immigrated to the U.S.[4] His father, Moise, was a computer programmer and his mother, Elise, was a schoolteacher.[5][6] Lasry grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and received a B.A. in history from Clark University in 1981 and a J.D. from New York Law School in 1984. While in law school, he worked as a clerk for the Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Southern District of New York, Edward Ryan.[7]
Career[edit]
After graduating from law school, Lasry took a position in the bankruptcy branch of the law firm Angel & Frankel.[7] Together with his sister Sonia Gardner, they founded Amroc Investments in 1989 and Avenue Capital Group in 1995. One year later[7] Lasry became the director of the private debt department at the investment firm R. D. Smith, now Smith Vasillou Management.[8] This is where Lasry first got involved in trade claims. He then took a position as Co-Director of the Bankruptcy and Corporate Reorganization Department at Cowen & Company.[8] There Lasry recruited his sister Sonia Gardner, also an attorney, to assist in the company's trade claims department.[8] Lasry left Cowen & Company and joined the Robert M. Bass Group, focused on distressed security investments.
In 1989, Lasry and his sister founded the firm Amroc Investments with $100 million in seed money from various investors. Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

Early life and education[edit]
Lasry was born in Marrakech to a family of Moroccan Jews.[3] When he was seven years old, he and his family immigrated to the U.S.[4] His father, Moise, was a computer programmer and his mother, Elise, was a schoolteacher.[5][6] Lasry grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut and received a B.A. in history from Clark University in 1981 and a J.D. from New York Law School in 1984. While in law school, he worked as a clerk for the Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Southern District of New York, Edward Ryan.[7]
Career[edit]
After graduating from law school, Lasry took a position in the bankruptcy branch of the law firm Angel & Frankel.[7] Together with his sister Sonia Gardner, they founded Amroc Investments in 1989 and Avenue Capital Group in 1995. One year later[7] Lasry became the director of the private debt department at the investment firm R. D. Smith, now Smith Vasillou Management.[8] This is where Lasry first got involved in trade claims. He then took a position as Co-Director of the Bankruptcy and Corporate Reorganization Department at Cowen & Company.[8] There Lasry recruited his sister Sonia Gardner, also an attorney, to assist in the company's trade claims department.[8] Lasry left Cowen & Company and joined the Robert M. Bass Group, focused on distressed security investments.
In 1989, Lasry and his sister founded the firm Amroc Investments with $100 million in seed money from various investors. Amroc purchased both trade claims and bank debt held by vendors of bankrupt and/or distressed companies.[3] In 1995, Lasry and Gardner invested $7 million of their own capital and founded the Avenue Capital Group, which initially focused on distressed debt and special situations primarily in the United States. The partners successfully expanded the firm's investment focus to Europe and Asia. The two went on to build their hedge fund, which had as much as $11 billion in assets under management.[5]
In 2013, Lasry was considered for the position of U.S. ambassador to France, but declined consideration for business reasons.[9] In 2014 Forbes listed Lasry as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $280 million.[10]
In April 2014, Lasry became co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks after purchasing the team from Herb Kohl for $550 million.[11] Following the 2016 U.S. election, Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks became one of three NBA teams to openly state they would not be staying at Trump branded hotels when on the road. [12]
Lasry is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.[13]
Lasry is a major Democratic Party donor.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2004, Lasry and his wife contributed support to the University of Pennsylvania and co-chaired the Penn Parent Leadership Committee.[15] In 2005 they donated $5 million to Clark University for the construction of the “Cathy '83 and Marc '81 Lasry Center for Bioscience”.[16]
Lasry served as a director of the 92nd Street Y and the Big Apple Circus and was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan). He is a prominent donor to Democratic Party causes.[17]
In January 2016 Lasry participated in "Portfolios with Purpose," an annual stock selection contest in which participants pick portfolios on behalf of their favorite charities.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Lasry is married to Cathy Cohen and has five children.[5][7] His son, Alexander, worked for White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett. Lasry's daughter, Samantha, was a staffer for congressman Rahm Emanuel.[19]
Lasry's hobbies include basketball, tennis[20] and comics.[21]

   Hedge Funds-The Smart Set  Quiznos Close to Deal with Lasry’s Avenue Capital    Published on December 22, 2011 at 12:00 pm by  
                                Renee Ann Butler
                                  in Hedge Funds,The Smart Set                 Sandwich chain Quiznos is in danger of bankruptcy reports the Wall Street Journal. If the company does not find a way to restructure its $870 million debt load, Quiznos will be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Its last hope for this restructuring is not a bank, but rather a hedge fund – Marc Lasry’s Avenue Capital to be exact. “Struggling amid slumping sales and a recent violation of debt terms, Quiznos has found a potential new owner in Avenue Capital Group, the hedge fund controlled by billionaire Marc Lasry,” reports the Wall Street Journal.  “Avenue would convert its debt to equity and invest cash in Quiznos as part of a tentative deal that would give the hedge fund more than a 70% ownership stake in the chain.” The plan, if approved, would cut Quiznos debt by roughly $281 million. The deal that is being discussed right now “is being driven by the company’s biggest lenders, who have a plan to take ownership of the company as long as other creditors give their consent.” The creditors have 30 days to accept the plan as written or face bankruptcy. Quiznos’ debt stems from five years ago when its current owners decided to purchase the chain in a leveraged buyout. At the time, the market was at its peak and Quiznos soon reported nearly 5,000 locations. Then, the recession hit and so was Quiznos. In addition, the chain also faced increased competition from Subway, as the sandwich chain expanded its offerings to include Quiznos mainstay – toasted sandwiches. All in all, Quiznos ended up having to close roughly 1,500 locations. “Quiznos warned lenders over the summer that sales were coming in below projections, which would likely cause the chain to violate loan terms and put it in default,” reports the Wall Street Journal. At that point, “The chain hired Wall Street restructuring lawyers and bankers to negotiate with investors,” a path which eventually led to Lasry. “Avenue’s Mr. Lasry, like other distressed-debt investors, often tries to gain control of troubled companies by purchasing discounted debt and later converting it to equity, which carries more risk but also the potential for greater reward.” For instance, “In the wake of the financial crisis, Mr. Lasry has led investors to gain control of three Atlantic City, N.J., casinos bearing Donald Trump’s name and broadcaster ION Media Networks Inc., among other companies.”              Related Insider Monkey ArticlesHedge Funds Lose After General Motors $GM Shares TumbleMarc Lasry’s Avenue Capital and Donald Trump Ante Up to Online GamingChina’s Property Bubble, Millennium Management’s John Novogratz...Hedge Fund News: Einhorn, Ambrosiadou, Paul Tudor JonesHedge Funds Make a Bundle on Dynegy $DYNHighest Paid Hedge Fund Managers in 2010 Marc Lasry Avenue Capital Quiznos                Insider Monkey Small Cap Strategy      Download a free copy of our newsletter and see the details inside!

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
