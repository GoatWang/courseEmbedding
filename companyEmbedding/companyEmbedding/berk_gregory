Verastem Names Gregory I. Berk, MD as Chief Medical Officer




- Announces Additional Key Executive Management Appointments and 
      Changes -






April 18, 2016 05:20 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Verastem, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSTM), focused on discovering and developing 
      drugs to treat cancer, today announced the appointment of Gregory I. 
      Berk, MD as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Berk will be responsible for 
      leading the Company's global clinical development strategy and clinical 
      operations. Dr. Berk replaces interim Chief Medical Officer, Lou 
      Vaickus, MD, FACP, from aktaPD who will continue to serve Verastem as a 
      consultant.
    


      “Greg is a highly accomplished physician and a well-regarded oncology 
      veteran with more than 25 years of both industry and academic 
      experience,” said Robert Forrester, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Verastem. “With deep experience in oncology drug development, 
      including the development of breakthrough therapies, we are confident 
      that his contributions will be of immediate value to Verastem. Greg’s 
      strategic insights will help lead the Company into the next phase of 
      growth. Several clinical collaborations are already underway with 
      world-class organizations like Pfizer, Merck KGaA, Merck & Co., and 
      Washington University in St. Louis, and additional clinical trials are 
      expected to commence this year.”
    

      “I am excited to join the talented and passionate team at Verastem at 
      this important time in the Company’s growth and evolution," commented 
      Dr. Berk. “Verastem’s multi-faceted approach to treating cancer by 
      reducing cancer stem cells, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and 
      modulating the local tumor microenvironment uniquely positions the 
      Company in the oncology space and holds significant untapped potential, 
      especially in aggressive cancers that carry poor prognoses and low 
      survival rates. Verastem’s compounds may be especially beneficial as 
      therapeutics when used in combination with immuno-oncology agents. 
      Together with our experienced leadership team, I look forward to 
      advancing Verastem’s clinical strategy, with the goal of bringing 
      innovative new cancer medicines to patients.”
    

      Verastem also announced the further strengthening of its management team 
      through the appointment and promotion of several key individuals. 
      Jonathan Pachter, PhD has been promoted to Chief Scientific Officer, and 
      David Weaver, PhD has been appointed as Vice President, Translational 
      Medicine. John “Jack” Green, has resigned as the Company’s part-time 
      Chief Financial Officer and will continue to serve the Company as a 
      consultant, and Joe Chiapponi, Vice President, Finance, has been named 
      Treasurer, Principal Accounting and Financial Officer.
    

      Mr. Forrester continued, “On behalf of Verastem and its Board of 
      Directors, I would like to congratulate Jon, David and Joe on their 
      promotions. This strategic augmentation of our management team with such 
      highly qualified professionals reflects a burgeoning operational need as 
      we advance our clinical programs, including in a growing number of 
      clinical collaborations evaluating our therapies in combination with 
      emerging and standard of care treatments. The Board and I wish to 
      express our gratitude to Lou and Jack for their outstanding 
      contributions and service to Verastem. Each has played an important role 
      in building the Company and helping to establish an internal 
      organization that is well-positioned to advance our strategy.”
    

      Dr. Berk comes to Verastem from Sideris Pharmaceuticals where he served 
      as President, Chief Medical Officer, and a member of the Board of 
      Directors since 2014. Prior to Sideris, Dr. Berk was Chief Medical

      Berk completed his internship, residency, and fellowship in internal 
      medicine, hematology, and medical oncology at the Weill Cornell Medical

      investigator on several industry-sponsored and cooperative group 
      clinical trials, including the pivotal trials for Gleevec® and Avastin®.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Berk has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Massachusetts.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Berk's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Berk's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.
