eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.








The Amazon.com eTextbooks Store




Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Well, you can save up to 80% off the print list price when you rent and up to 60% off the print list price when you buy eTextbooks. Renting eTextbooks couldn’t be easier. With flexible rental options, you only have to pay for the time you need. Choose a rental length between 30 and 360 days and extend it for as little as one day. You even have the option to purchase at any time.




Don’t worry about breaking your back either. You’ll be able to carry your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around your heavy textbooks across campus. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Kindle, iPad, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle reading app.




Save time with digital interactive features that make paper books look prehistoric. Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube.
