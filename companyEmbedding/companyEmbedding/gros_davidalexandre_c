CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alnylam 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY), a 
      leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced the appointment of 
      David-Alexandre “DA” Gros, M.D. to the position of Senior Vice

      will be joining the Alnylam Management Board.
    


      “We are in a very exciting period of growth at Alnylam, as we aim to 
      execute on our ‘Alnylam 2020’ goals and transition from a late-stage 
      clinical development company to become a multi-product, commercial stage 
      company with a sustainable development pipeline,” said John Maraganore, 
      Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. “DA brings to Alnylam an 
      impressive array of experiences in the pharmaceutical industry and in 
      healthcare investment banking and management consulting. In addition, 
      his background in corporate strategy will prove invaluable as we execute

      “Alnylam is a remarkably innovative company, leading the advancement of 
      RNAi therapeutics as a new class of innovative medicines to address 
      major unmet needs for a wide range of diseases globally, with a history 
      of building significant alliances,” said Dr. Gros. “I’m particularly 
      excited to join the team during this pivotal period, in capitalizing on 
      the company’s potential and contributing to its continued success.”
    

      Most recently, Dr. Gros was Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy 
      Officer at Sanofi, where he was a member of the Executive Committee and

      corporate strategy, business development and licensing, mergers and 
      acquisitions, alliance management, and structured investments including 
      the corporate venture fund. During his tenure, he oversaw the execution 
      of over 100 successful transactions and the launch of Sanofi’s corporate 
      venture activities, and he was closely involved in the company’s key 
      alliances with Alnylam and Regeneron. Prior to Sanofi, he held 
      management positions with a focus on the pharmaceutical industry in 
      investment banking at Centerview Partners and Merrill Lynch & Co, and in 
      consulting at McKinsey & Co. Dr. Gros holds an M.D. from The Johns 
      Hopkins University School of Medicine, an M.B.A. from Harvard Business 
      School, and a B.A. from Dartmouth College.
    

About RNAi


      RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a 
      breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, 
      and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its 
      discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that 
      happens once every decade or so,” and represents one of the most 
      promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery 
      today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. 
      RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms 
      ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological 
      process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new 
      class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small 
      interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise 
      Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by 
      potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing 
      proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat 
      disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.
    

About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals


      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics 
      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the 
      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam’s 
      pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic 
      Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of 
      RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic 
      Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically 
      validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in 
      cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease, 
      with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global 
      health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam 
      launched its “Alnylam 2020” guidance for the advancement and 
      commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of 
      innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects 
      to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi 
      therapeutic clinical programs – including 4 in late stages of 
      development – across its 3 STArs. The company’s demonstrated commitment 
      to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading 
      companies including Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, Biogen, Roche, Takeda, 
      Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Cubist, GlaxoSmithKline, Ascletis, Monsanto, The 
      Medicines Company, and Genzyme, a Sanofi company. In addition, Alnylam 
      holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused 
      on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA 
      therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their 
      research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers, 
      including many in the world’s top scientific journals such as Nature, 
      Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of 
      Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains 
      headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information about 
      Alnylam’s pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics, please visit www.alnylam.com.

      expectations, plans and prospects, including without limitation, 
      Alnylam’s expectations regarding its “Alnylam 2020” guidance, Alnylam’s

      provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these 
      forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, 
      including, without limitation, Alnylam’s ability to manage operating 
      expenses, Alnylam’s ability to discover and develop novel drug 
      candidates and delivery approaches, successfully demonstrate the 
      efficacy and safety of its drug candidates, the pre-clinical and 
      clinical results for its product candidates, which may not be replicated 
      or continue to occur in other subjects or in additional studies or 
      otherwise support further development of product candidates, actions of 
      regulatory agencies, which may affect the initiation, timing and 
      progress of clinical trials, obtaining, maintaining and protecting 
      intellectual property, Alnylam’s ability to enforce its patents against 
      infringers and defend its patent portfolio against challenges from third 
      parties, obtaining regulatory approval for products, competition from 
      others using technology similar to Alnylam’s and others developing 
      products for similar uses, Alnylam’s ability to obtain additional 
      funding to support its business activities and establish and maintain 
      strategic business alliances and new business initiatives, Alnylam’s 
      dependence on third parties for development, manufacture, marketing, 
      sales and distribution of products, the outcome of litigation, and 
      unexpected expenditures, as well as those risks more fully discussed in 
      the “Risk Factors” filed with Alnylam’s most recent Quarterly Report on 
      Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in 
      other filings that Alnylam makes with the SEC. In addition, any 
      forward-looking statements represent Alnylam’s views only as of today 
      and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any

06.08.2015

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Alnylam

      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY), a

      leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced the appointment of

      David-Alexandre "DA" Gros, M.D. to the position of Senior Vice

      President, Chief Business Officer. Dr. Gros joins Alnylam with extensive

      experience in the pharmaceutical industry and in healthcare investment

      banking and consulting. At Alnylam, he will be responsible for the

      company's corporate and business development, finance, corporate

      communications, and investor relations functions. In addition, Dr. Gros

      will be joining the Alnylam Management Board.

    


      "We are in a very exciting period of growth at Alnylam, as we aim to

      execute on our ‘Alnylam 2020' goals and transition from a late-stage

      clinical development company to become a multi-product, commercial stage

      company with a sustainable development pipeline," said John Maraganore,

      Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. "DA brings to Alnylam an

      impressive array of experiences in the pharmaceutical industry and in

      healthcare investment banking and management consulting. In addition,

      his background in corporate strategy will prove invaluable as we execute

      on our Alnylam 2020 goals. We're thrilled to have him join our team."

    


      "Alnylam is a remarkably innovative company, leading the advancement of

      RNAi therapeutics as a new class of innovative medicines to address

      major unmet needs for a wide range of diseases globally, with a history

      of building significant alliances," said Dr. Gros. "I'm particularly

      excited to join the team during this pivotal period, in capitalizing on

      the company's potential and contributing to its continued success."

    


      Most recently, Dr. Gros was Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy

      Officer at Sanofi, where he was a member of the Executive Committee and

      the Global Leadership Team. His responsibilities included leading

      corporate strategy, business development and licensing, mergers and

      acquisitions, alliance management, and structured investments including

      the corporate venture fund. During his tenure, he oversaw the execution

      of over 100 successful transactions and the launch of Sanofi's corporate

      venture activities, and he was closely involved in the company's key

      alliances with Alnylam and Regeneron. Prior to Sanofi, he held

      management positions with a focus on the pharmaceutical industry in

      investment banking at Centerview Partners and Merrill Lynch & Co, and in

      consulting at McKinsey & Co. Dr. Gros holds an M.D. from The Johns

      Hopkins University School of Medicine, an M.B.A. from Harvard Business

      School, and a B.A. from Dartmouth College.

    

About RNAi



      RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a

      breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells,

      and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its

      discovery has been heralded as "a major scientific breakthrough that

      happens once every decade or so," and represents one of the most

      promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery

      today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

      RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms

      ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological

      process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new

      class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small

      interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise

      Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by

      potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing

      proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat

      disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.

    

About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals



      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics

      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the

      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam's

      pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic

      Therapeutic Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of

      RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic

      Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically

      validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in

      cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and Hepatic Infectious Disease,

      with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that address the major global

      health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. In early 2015, Alnylam

      launched its "Alnylam 2020" guidance for the advancement and

      commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of

      innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects

      to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi

      therapeutic clinical programs - including 4 in late stages of

      development - across its 3 STArs. The company's demonstrated commitment

      to RNAi therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading

      companies including Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, Biogen, Roche, Takeda,

      Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Cubist, GlaxoSmithKline, Ascletis, Monsanto, The

      Medicines Company, and Genzyme, a Sanofi company. In addition, Alnylam

      holds an equity position in Regulus Therapeutics Inc., a company focused

      on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA

      therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and collaborators have published their

      research on RNAi therapeutics in over 200 peer-reviewed papers,

      including many in the world's top scientific journals such as Nature,

      Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Cell, New England Journal of

      Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains

      headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information about

      Alnylam's pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics, please visit www.alnylam.com.
