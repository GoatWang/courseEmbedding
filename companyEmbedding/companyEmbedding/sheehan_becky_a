	Cars.com announced today the appointment of Becky A. Sheehan as the company’s chief financial officer (CFO), effective Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. Sheehan joins Cars.com from her role as executive vice president and chief financial officer for FTD Companies, Inc., where she also served as a member of the office of the chief executive officer. 

	Sheehan presided over a period of tremendous growth at the digital consumer company, which saw revenues double during her 10-year tenure fueled by carefully planned organic expansion and acquisitions under her leadership. She directed FTD’s initial public offering in 2013 and continued to oversee its growth as a stand-alone company.  In addition to her public company experience as a CFO, Sheehan spent 19 years in public accounting, most recently as an audit partner with Deloitte LLP. At Deloitte, she served as the leader of the Manufacturing and Consumer audit practice for the Chicago office. Prior to joining Deloitte, she was a partner with Arthur Andersen. Sheehan is a certified public accountant and received her bachelor's degree in accounting from Illinois State University.

	“In this next phase of our evolution, Cars.com is poised for expansion and revenue growth, and we’re excited to have Becky aboard as an experienced public company executive who will be a critical leader in our spin from TEGNA (NYSE: TGNA) and beyond,” said Alex Vetter, president and chief executive officer of Cars.com. “She is a proven leader who understands our goal of becoming the leading decision engine that moves people through the car ownership lifecycle with transparent, fun and engaging experiences, and is passionate about building a business that will help us realize this mission.” 

	“I’m thrilled to have this opportunity to help guide the growth of another fast-growing, publicly traded technology company and I look forward to applying the considerable experience that I gained while transforming FTD’s online consumer business to my new role at Cars.com,” said Sheehan. “Together with Alex and the great team at Cars.com, we’ll enhance our leadership position, achieve our growth strategy and fulfill our purpose of helping people win.”

	“We are on an incredible trajectory in terms of growth and talent,” added Vetter. “Becky’s addition completes a significant round of new leadership hires for Cars.com, and we now have the collective experience with high-growth technology companies to expand our reach and continue to provide more value to our consumers and advertisers.”

CHICAGO, Jan. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cars.com announced today the appointment of Becky A. Sheehan as the company's chief financial officer (CFO), effective Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. Sheehan joins Cars.com from her role as executive vice president and chief financial officer for FTD Companies, Inc., where she also served as a member of the office of the chief executive officer. 


Sheehan presided over a period of tremendous growth at the digital consumer company, which saw revenues double during her 10-year tenure fueled by carefully planned organic expansion and acquisitions under her leadership. She directed FTD's initial public offering in 2013 and continued to oversee its growth as a stand-alone company. In addition to her public company experience as a CFO, Sheehan spent 19 years in public accounting, most recently as an audit partner with Deloitte LLP. At Deloitte, she served as the leader of the Manufacturing and Consumer audit practice for the Chicago office. Prior to joining Deloitte, she was a partner with Arthur Andersen. Sheehan is a certified public accountant and received her bachelor's degree in accounting from Illinois State University.
"In this next phase of our evolution, Cars.com is poised for expansion and revenue growth, and we're excited to have Becky aboard as an experienced public company executive who will be a critical leader in our spin from TEGNA (NYSE:    TGNA) and beyond," said Alex Vetter, president and chief executive officer of Cars.com. "She is a proven leader who understands our goal of becoming the leading decision engine that moves people through the car ownership lifecycle with transparent, fun and engaging experiences, and is passionate about building a business that will help us realize this mission." 
"I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to help guide the growth of another fast-growing, publicly traded technology company and I look forward to applying the considerable experience that I gained while transforming FTD's online consumer business to my new role at Cars.com," said Sheehan. "Together with Alex and the great team at Cars.com, we'll enhance our leadership position, achieve our growth strategy and fulfill our purpose of helping people win."
"We are on an incredible trajectory in terms of growth and talent," added Vetter. "Becky's addition completes a significant round of new leadership hires for Cars.com, and we now have the collective experience with high-growth technology companies to expand our reach and continue to provide more value to our consumers and advertisers."
