History[edit]
The company has its foundation in the Eveready Battery Company, which in 1980 changed the name of its Eveready Alkaline Power Cell to Energizer. In 1986, Eveready Battery Company was sold to animal and human food manufacturer Ralston Purina. In 2000, Ralston spun off Eveready, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Energizer Holdings, Inc..
In 2003 under the leadership of then Chief Executive Officer J. Patrick Mulcahy, Energizer Holdings started expanding into the personal care product sector by buying personal care and razor brand Schick and gardening tools and razor brand Wilkinson Sword from Pfizer.
In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Energizer worked with the Red Cross to donate flashlights, batteries, razors and funds to help Hurricane Katrina relief workers and victims.[7] On November 3, 2005, Energizer Holdings Inc.said that higher sales of its Schick razors and blades partially offset lower sales of its batteries in North America. On a constant-currency basis, sales at Energizer rose 4 percent in its fourth quarter.[8]
In October 2007, the company acquired Playtex Products, Inc. for $1.9 billion. The purchase included sunscreen brand Hawaiian Tropic, which Playtex had bought a few months earlier, and Sun Pharmaceuticals Corp., which manufactures the Banana Boat sunscreen products.[9]
In 2009, Energizer acquired Edge and Skintimate shaving gels from S.C. Johnson & Son.[10][11]
In October 2010, Energizer announced it was the winning bidder for privately held American Safety Razor in a bankruptcy court auction.[12]
The maker of Banana Boat sunscreen recalled a half-million bottles of spray-on lotion after reports that a handful of people have caught on fire after applying the product and coming in contact with an open flame.
On October 19, 2012 Energizer Holdings said it was withdrawing 23 varieties of its Banana Boat brand of UltraMist spray-on sunscreen lotion from stores due to the risk of it igniting when exposed to fire.[13]
On July 31, 2013, Energizer bought the Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands from Johnson & Johnson for $185 million. The purchase was only for the brands in North America - Johnson & Johnson continues to own the brands in all other regions of the world.[14]
On April 30, 2014, Energizer announced that by September 2015 it would separate its two lines of business into two publicly traded companies. The household business, with revenue of $1.9 billion in the latest fiscal year, would have Energizer chairman J. Patrick Mulcahy as its chairman and unit chief Alan Hoskins as CEO, and would sell batteries, flashlights and lamps. The personal care company, whose revenue was $2.6 billion, would have Energizer CEO Ward Klein serving as chairman and current unit head David Hatfield as CEO, and would sell feminine products from Playtex, Carefree, o.b. and Stayfree; shaving products from Schick, Edge, Skintimate and Wilkinson Sword; and suntan products from Hawaiian Tropic and Banana Boat.[15][16]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Energizer Holdings is an American manufacturer of batteries, headquartered in Town and Country, Missouri.[3][4][5][6] It produces batteries under the Energizer and Eveready brand names, and formerly owned a number of personal care businesses until it separated that side of the business into a new company called Edgewell Personal Care in 2015.

History[edit]
The company has its foundation in the Eveready Battery Company, which in 1980 changed the name of its Eveready Alkaline Power Cell to Energizer. In 1986, Eveready Battery Company was sold to animal and human food manufacturer Ralston Purina. In 2000, Ralston spun off Eveready, and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Energizer Holdings, Inc..
In 2003 under the leadership of then Chief Executive Officer J. Patrick Mulcahy, Energizer Holdings started expanding into the personal care product sector by buying personal care and razor brand Schick and gardening tools and razor brand Wilkinson Sword from Pfizer.
In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Energizer worked with the Red Cross to donate flashlights, batteries, razors and funds to help Hurricane Katrina relief workers and victims.[7] On November 3, 2005, Energizer Holdings Inc.said that higher sales of its Schick razors and blades partially offset lower sales of its batteries in North America. On a constant-currency basis, sales at Energizer rose 4 percent in its fourth quarter.[8]
In October 2007, the company acquired Playtex Products, Inc. for $1.9 billion. The purchase included sunscreen brand Hawaiian Tropic, which Playtex had bought a few months earlier, and Sun Pharmaceuticals Corp., which manufactures the Banana Boat sunscreen products.[9]
In 2009, Energizer acquired Edge and Skintimate shaving gels from S.C. Johnson & Son.[10][11]
In October 2010, Energizer announced it was the winning bidder for privately held American Safety Razor in a bankruptcy court auction.[12]
The maker of Banana Boat sunscreen recalled a half-million bottles of spray-on lotion after reports that a handful of people have caught on fire after applying the product and coming in contact with an open flame.
On October 19, 2012 Energizer Holdings said it was withdrawing 23 varieties of its Banana Boat brand of UltraMist spray-on sunscreen lotion from stores due to the risk of it igniting when exposed to fire.[13]
On July 31, 2013, Energizer bought the Stayfree, Carefree and o.b. brands from Johnson & Johnson for $185 million. The purchase was only for the brands in North America - Johnson & Johnson continues to own the brands in all other regions of the world.[14]
On April 30, 2014, Energizer announced that by September 2015 it would separate its two lines of business into two publicly traded companies. The household business, with revenue of $1.9 billion in the latest fiscal year, would have Energizer chairman J. Patrick Mulcahy as its chairman and unit chief Alan Hoskins as CEO, and would sell batteries, flashlights and lamps. The personal care company, whose revenue was $2.6 billion, would have Energizer CEO Ward Klein serving as chairman and current unit head David Hatfield as CEO, and would sell feminine products from Playtex, Carefree, o.b. and Stayfree; shaving products from Schick, Edge, Skintimate and Wilkinson Sword; and suntan products from Hawaiian Tropic and Banana Boat.[15][16]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Announces Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Results and Updates Financial Outlook for Fiscal 2017PR NewswireMay 3, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareST. LOUIS, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Reported net sales increased 7.5% in the second fiscal quarter versus the prior year due to incremental net sales from the auto care acquisition of 8.8%, partially offset by unfavorable currency of 1.3%Diluted EPS was $0.75 in the second fiscal quarter compared to $0.26 in the prior year second quarter, and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.50 compared to $0.30 in the prior year second quarter, up 67%Raises full year adjusted EPS outlook to $2.75 to $2.85Energizer Holdings, Inc. (ENR) today announced results for the second fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, 2017.  For the second fiscal quarter, net earnings were $46.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $16.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net earnings in the second quarter were $31.4 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings of $18.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year second quarter."Our team delivered solid results in the second quarter continuing the momentum from the start of the year," said Alan Hoskins, Chief Executive Officer.  "We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, including effective in-store fundamentals, which enabled us to offset the retailer inventory de-load and improve margin performance in the current quarter. In addition, the integration of our auto care business remains on track and all major initiatives will be completed by the end of the third quarter.  With the strong performance in the quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to $2.75 to $2.85."Second Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights (Unaudited)The following is a summary of key second fiscal quarter results.  All comparisons are with the second quarter of fiscal 2016 unless otherwise stated. Net sales were $359.0 million, an increase of 7.5%: (a)  Net sales increased $29.4 million, or 8.8%, due to the impact of the auto care acquisition. Unfavorable currency impacts were $4.4 million, or 1.3%. Organic net sales were flat for the quarter as carryover distribution and space gains and improved pricing and product mix were fully offset by the anticipated retailer inventory de-load in the current fiscal quarter.  Gross Margin percentage was 46.8%, up 440 basis points. Excluding unusuals, gross margin increased by 390 basis points, driven by cost reductions realized from continued productivity improvements as well as the year over year benefit of productivity investments recorded in the prior year, material and purchased product cost favorability and improved pricing and product mix. (a)A&P spending was 4.6% of net sales, a decrease of 80 basis points, or $1.5 million, versus the prior year.SG&A spending, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was $88.1 million, an increase of $6.9 million over the prior year. The increase was due in part to $3.1 million of incremental SG&A related to the acquired auto care business. SG&A, excluding acquisition and integration costs, was 24.5% of net sales compared to 24.3% in the prior year. (a)Spin restructuring related income was $2.5 million in the second fiscal quarter reflecting the change in estimate of spin accruals on contract termination costs.Gain on sale of real estate was $15.2 million related to the sale of office building space in Asia.Earnings before income tax was negatively impacted by the movement in foreign currencies by approximately $3 million, net of hedge impact, in the second fiscal quarter.Income tax rate on a year to date basis was 26.3% as compared to 29.1% in the prior year. Excluding unusual items, the year to date ex-unusual rate was 28.5% as compared to 29.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the discrete tax benefit recognized in our income tax provision as a result of the new stock compensation guidance adopted in the first quarter.Net cash from operating activities on a year to date basis was $124.3 million and Free Cash Flow on a year to date basis was $135.1 million, or 14.7% of net sales. (a)Dividend payments in the quarter were approximately $17 million, or $0.275 per share, and approximately $35 million on a year to date basis, or $0.55 per share.Repurchased approximately 192,000 shares of common stock on a year to date basis for $8.6 million. (b)(a) See Press Release attachments for additional information as well as the GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations.(b) Share repurchases on the Statement of Cash Flows include $0.7 million of fiscal 2016 repurchases that were cash settled in fiscal 2017.

The strong sell through early in the holiday season resulted in replenishment orders prior to the end of the first quarter resulting in the retailer de-load that occurred in the second fiscal quarter.  Net sales increased $29.4 million, or 8.8%, due to the impact of the auto care acquisition.Unfavorable currency impacts were $4.4 million, or 1.3%.   Total Segment Profit (In millions - Unaudited)     For the Quarter and Six Months Ended March 31, 2017       Q2    % Chg    Six Months    % Chg     Segment Profit - FY'16    $   68.4       $   209.6        Organic    17.3     25.3   %    48.9     23.3   %     Impact of acquisition    10.2     14.9   %    18.4     8.8   %     Impact of currency    (2.1)     (3.1)   %    (9.2)     (4.4)   %     Segment Profit - FY'17    $   93.8     37.1   %    $   267.7     27.7   %  Total Segment Profit in the second fiscal quarter increased $25.4 million, or 37.1%.  Excluding the unfavorable movement in foreign currencies of $2.1 million and the favorable impact of the acquisition of $10.2 million, organic segment profit increased $17.3 million, or 25.3%, in the current fiscal quarter.  The organic segment profit increase was primarily driven by improved gross margin as a result of cost reductions realized from continued productivity improvements as well as the year over year benefit of productivity investments recorded in the prior year, material and purchased product cost favorability and improved pricing and product mix.  The timing of A&P spending also contributed to the segment profit increase.Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures attached for further information on our above breakouts.Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2017The company increased its previously communicated adjusted EPS outlook for the full fiscal year to $2.75 to $2.85.  This range is inclusive of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 from the recently acquired auto care business.The company is providing the following assumptions related to the full year financial outlook for fiscal year 2017.  All comparisons are with the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 unless otherwise stated.Net sales are expected to be up mid-single digits:  Organic net sales are expected to be up low-single digits; The incremental impact of the auto care acquisition is expected to increase net sales by 5% to 6%; and Unfavorable movements in foreign currencies are expected to reduce net sales by 1.5% to 2.5%, based upon recent currency rates.  Gross margin rates, excluding unusuals, are now expected to improve by 100 to 125 basis points.SG&A as a percent of net sales, excluding integration costs and certain other items, is expected to improve 50 to 100 basis points and be in the range of 19 to 20 percent.Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) is expected to be negatively impacted by the movement in foreign currencies by $15 to $20 million, net of hedge impact, based upon recent currency rates.Income tax rate, excluding integration costs and certain other items, is now expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 29.5 percent.Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $30 to $35 million.Net Cash from operating activities is expected to exceed $200 million and Free Cash Flow is now expected to exceed $190 million.Acquisition and integration costs are expected to be in the range of $5 to $10 million.Webcast InformationIn conjunction with this announcement, the Company will hold an investor conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. eastern time today.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as costs related to the spin, restructuring activities, acquisition and integration costs and gains on sale of real estate.  In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures.We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure in the following supplemental schedules:Segment Profit.  This amount represents the operations of our three geographic segments including allocations for shared support functions.  General corporate and other expenses, Global marketing expenses, R&D expenses, amortization expense, interest expense, other items, net, and charges related to the spin-off, restructuring, acquisition and integration and gains on sale of real estate have all been excluded from segment profit.Adjusted Earnings Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS.  These measures exclude the impact of the spin-off, restructurings, acquisition and integration and gains on sale of real estate.Ex-unusual Tax Rate.  This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of the spin-off, restructurings, acquisition and integration and gains on sale of real estate, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the costs were incurred.Organic.  This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue, segment profit or other margins that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:Impact of acquisitions. The Company acquired an auto care business on July 1, 2016.  This includes the impact of the auto care on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption.  This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs associated with the auto care acquisition.Impact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis.  The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.Adjusted Comparisons.  Detail for adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to spin-off, restructuring, acquisition and integration.Free Cash Flow.  Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from asset sales.  Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is generated outside of the U.S.  The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements.Energizer Holdings, Inc.Supplemental Schedules - Segment Information and Supplemental Sales DataFor the Quarter and Six Months Ended March 31, 2017 (In millions, except per share data - Unaudited)As of October 1, 2016, the Company changed its internal reporting structure and is managing operations via three major geographic reportable segments: Americas (North America and Latin America), Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia Pacific.  Prior to this year, the Americas segment was reported as two separate geographic reportable segments.  The Company changed its internal reporting structure to combine these two geographic regions to better reflect how the Company is managing the operations.Energizer's operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world.  Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and also do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.Segment sales and profitability, as well as the reconciliation to earnings before tax, for the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are presented below:   Quarter Ended March 31,    Six Months Ended March 31,      2017    2016    2017    2016     Net Sales            Americas   $   218.5     $   194.9     $   583.6     $   508.6      EMEA   74.1     76.3     188.8     194.2      Asia Pacific   66.4     62.8     146.2     138.0      Total net sales   $   359.0     $   334.0     $   918.6     $   840.8      Segment Profit            Americas   $   60.5     $   45.7     $   183.6     $   144.4      EMEA   14.0     8.2     40.1     31.2      Asia Pacific   19.3     14.5     44.0     34.0      Total segment profit   $   93.8     $   68.4     $   267.7     $   209.6        General corporate and other expenses (1)   (26.4)     (21.3)     (40.5)     (37.2)        Global marketing expense (1)   (4.0)     (3.1)     (7.0)     (5.3)        Research and development expense   (5.1)     (6.4)     (10.9)     (12.5)        Amortization of intangible assets   (3.0)     —     (5.6)     —        Restructuring (2)   —     (1.5)     —     (4.8)        Acquisition and integration costs (2)   (1.7)     —     (2.5)     —        Spin costs (2)   —     (2.7)     —     (8.7)        Spin restructuring   2.5     0.8     3.8     (0.1)        Gain on sale of real estate   15.2     —     15.2     —        Interest expense   (13.1)     (13.1)     (26.4)     (26.0)        Other items, net   1.1     (0.1)     (0.4)     0.5      Total earnings before income taxes   $   59.3     $   21.0     $   193.4     $   115.5         (1) Recorded in SG&A on the unaudited Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
