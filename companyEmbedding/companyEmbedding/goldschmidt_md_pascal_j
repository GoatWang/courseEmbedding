Career[edit]
Goldschmidt joined University of Miami in April 2006, and oversaw the purchase of Cedars Medical Center in November 2007, which is now University of Miami Hospital, the flagship hospital of UHealth. Following the layoff of 800 employees in June 2012, this rapid expansion was reported to be a contributing factor to Miller Medical School's financial troubles,[1] but is a trend seen in various health systems across the country. He also established the first internal medicine residency training program in Palm Beach County.[citation needed]
New global health clinical and research initiatives include the Global Institute for Community Health and Development and the International Medicine Institute. It was through the Global Institute for Community Health and Development that Goldschmidt was able to launch and oversee the medical relief effort in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake. A team of Miller School physicians, nurses and staff was the first to arrive in Port-au-Prince, and within nine days of the earthquake the University of Miami Hospital in Haiti was open and treating patients.
Research and Awards[edit]
The research enterprise has also grown significantly since 2006 with the creation of the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics and the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute. Both institutes are headed by world-renowned researchers.[citation needed]
In October 2008, Goldschmidt received the inaugural Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein Prize[2] in Cardiovascular Sciences from the Ohio State University Heart and Vascular Center. The prize is awarded biennially to an international leader in the clinical sciences of cardiovascular medicine, cardiothoracic surgery, or the basic sciences of molecular or cellular cardiology.
Goldschmidt's research applies genomics and cell therapy to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. His studies[3] involve Reactive oxygen species, Inflammation, Small GTP-Binding Proteins, hypertrophy, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Goldschmidt was previously chairman of the Department of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center.[4] Before taking the chairman’s role, he served as chief of Duke University's Division of Cardiology.[5]
Before joining the Duke faculty in 2000, he was director of cardiology at Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health, where he built the Heart and Lung Research Institute and a heart hospital.
A native of Belgium, Goldschmidt received his medical degree from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles and completed residency and fellowship training in Brussels at Hôpital Erasme and in the United States at Johns Hopkins University. Following his training at Hopkins, he served as an associate professor in the university’s Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Department of Pathology, and Division of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine until 1997.[6]
Reporting outside income and conflict of interest issues[edit]
Goldschmidt was instrumental in the development and implementation of the University of Miami public database on conflict of interest for all faculty at the Miller School of Medicine, one of the very few US medical school to provide such public information, and ahead of any requests to do so from the National Institute of Health.[citation needed]. However,the information in this public faculty disclosure database ceased to be updated after December 2011.[7] An article evaluating public disclosure of outside income by medical school deans reported that Goldschmidt did not publicly disclose stock options from companies where he served on the board of directors in 2009 (OPKO and MEDNAX).[8][9] In a 2010 proxy statement,[10] MEDNAX disclosed that until September 2009, Dr. Medel, MEDNAX’s Chief Executive Officer, served on the Trustee Services Committee for the University of Miami and participated in setting performance goals and annual bonus allocations for University of Miami employees, including Goldschmidt. It is claimed that the 2010 version of the reporting system did not have the option to disclose unexercised stock options, making it impossible to disclose unexercised stock options for the period from 6/1/2010 – 5/31/2011; the option was later added in the 2011 version[citation needed]. Income of $1,713,300.00 and $605,658 from sale of MEDNAX stocks on 5/9/2014 and 3/9/2015 remains undisclosed.[11][12] The subject of conflict of interest also arose in 2010, when Goldschmidt hired psychiatrist Charles Nemeroff as chair of psychiatry, one year after Nemeroff was ousted as psychiatry chair at Emory University after a probe led by Senator Charles Grassley revealed he had failed to declare at least US$1.2 million in income from drug companies.[13][14] During 6/1/2010 - 12/31/2011, Goldschmidt's outside income from serving on boards of directors is reported[7] as: $50,001-$100,000 from Health Management Associates, $50,001-$100,000 from MEDNAX, More than $200,000 from OPKO Health and $10,001 - $25,000 from Synecor (Scientific Advisory Board). Goldschmidt's salary was $1,072,117 in 2009-2010, $1,312,960 in 2010-2011 and $1,447,160 in 2011-2012.[15]
Faculty Senate Committee on Medical Issues[edit]
On August 2012, the University of Miami Faculty Senate Ad Hoc committee on medical issues presented its report to UM president, Donna Shalala, and to Dean Pascal Goldschmidt.[16] The committee reported that interviewed senior faculty members and high level administrators described a widespread fear of the administration due to retaliations against faculty that criticized the administration. Interviewed faculty also indicated adverse effects of staff reductions on the Miller School faculty’s ability to deliver care and to conduct both basic and clinical research. Faculty also stated that the pressure to produce clinical income is compromising the academic environment by discouraging and devaluing research and, as a consequence, morale was exceedingly low. The committee recommended a formal senate resolution to urge the Miller School and its Faculty Council to work together to address the highly destructive influence of the absence of a collegial environment. On January 2013, the Miami Herald reported[17] that an estimated 700 of the 1200 faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have signed a petition complaining about the school’s leadership. A copy of the petition obtained by The Herald stated that faculty decried the “failed leadership” of Dean Pascal Goldschmidt and Chief Operating Officer Jack Lord, stating that “We want to make clear that the faculty has lost confidence in the ability of these men to lead the school.” In a ballot conducted by the university in 2013, a majority of faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine voted against Dr. Goldschmidt's retention as Dean and were overruled by the university's president, Donna Shalala, who decided to retain Dr. Goldschmidt.[18]

Pascal J. Goldschmidt


'Pascal J. Goldschmidt-Clermont, M.D.,is a cardiologist and cardiovascular researcher, and former dean of the University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine. Until January 2016 he also served as chief executive officer of the University of Miami Health System (UHealth), which includes six hospitals and outpatient facilities in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Monroe and Collier counties, with more than 1,200 physicians and 8,000 staff.

Career[edit]
Goldschmidt joined University of Miami in April 2006, and oversaw the purchase of Cedars Medical Center in November 2007, which is now University of Miami Hospital, the flagship hospital of UHealth. Following the layoff of 800 employees in June 2012, this rapid expansion was reported to be a contributing factor to Miller Medical School's financial troubles,[1] but is a trend seen in various health systems across the country. He also established the first internal medicine residency training program in Palm Beach County.[citation needed]
New global health clinical and research initiatives include the Global Institute for Community Health and Development and the International Medicine Institute. It was through the Global Institute for Community Health and Development that Goldschmidt was able to launch and oversee the medical relief effort in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake. A team of Miller School physicians, nurses and staff was the first to arrive in Port-au-Prince, and within nine days of the earthquake the University of Miami Hospital in Haiti was open and treating patients.
Research and Awards[edit]
The research enterprise has also grown significantly since 2006 with the creation of the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics and the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute. Both institutes are headed by world-renowned researchers.[citation needed]
In October 2008, Goldschmidt received the inaugural Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein Prize[2] in Cardiovascular Sciences from the Ohio State University Heart and Vascular Center. The prize is awarded biennially to an international leader in the clinical sciences of cardiovascular medicine, cardiothoracic surgery, or the basic sciences of molecular or cellular cardiology.
Goldschmidt's research applies genomics and cell therapy to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. His studies[3] involve Reactive oxygen species, Inflammation, Small GTP-Binding Proteins, hypertrophy, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Goldschmidt was previously chairman of the Department of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center.[4] Before taking the chairman’s role, he served as chief of Duke University's Division of Cardiology.[5]
Before joining the Duke faculty in 2000, he was director of cardiology at Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health, where he built the Heart and Lung Research Institute and a heart hospital.
A native of Belgium, Goldschmidt received his medical degree from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles and completed residency and fellowship training in Brussels at Hôpital Erasme and in the United States at Johns Hopkins University. Following his training at Hopkins, he served as an associate professor in the university’s Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Department of Pathology, and Division of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine until 1997.[6]
Reporting outside income and conflict of interest issues[edit]
Goldschmidt was instrumental in the development and implementation of the University of Miami public database on conflict of interest for all faculty at the Miller School of Medicine, one of the very few US medical school to provide such public information, and ahead of any requests to do so from the National Institute of Health.[citation needed]. However,the information in this public faculty disclosure database ceased to be updated after December 2011.[7] An article evaluating public disclosure of outside income by medical school deans reported that Goldschmidt did not publicly disclose stock options from companies where he served on the board of directors in 2009 (OPKO and MEDNAX).[8][9] In a 2010 proxy statement,[10] MEDNAX disclosed that until September 2009, Dr. Medel, MEDNAX’s Chief Executive Officer, served on the Trustee Services Committee for the University of Miami and participated in setting performance goals and annual bonus allocations for University of Miami employees, including Goldschmidt. It is claimed that the 2010 version of the reporting system did not have the option to disclose unexercised stock options, making it impossible to disclose unexercised stock options for the period from 6/1/2010 – 5/31/2011; the option was later added in the 2011 version[citation needed]. Income of $1,713,300.00 and $605,658 from sale of MEDNAX stocks on 5/9/2014 and 3/9/2015 remains undisclosed.[11][12] The subject of conflict of interest also arose in 2010, when Goldschmidt hired psychiatrist Charles Nemeroff as chair of psychiatry, one year after Nemeroff was ousted as psychiatry chair at Emory University after a probe led by Senator Charles Grassley revealed he had failed to declare at least US$1.2 million in income from drug companies.[13][14] During 6/1/2010 - 12/31/2011, Goldschmidt's outside income from serving on boards of directors is reported[7] as: $50,001-$100,000 from Health Management Associates, $50,001-$100,000 from MEDNAX, More than $200,000 from OPKO Health and $10,001 - $25,000 from Synecor (Scientific Advisory Board). Goldschmidt's salary was $1,072,117 in 2009-2010, $1,312,960 in 2010-2011 and $1,447,160 in 2011-2012.[15]
Faculty Senate Committee on Medical Issues[edit]
On August 2012, the University of Miami Faculty Senate Ad Hoc committee on medical issues presented its report to UM president, Donna Shalala, and to Dean Pascal Goldschmidt.[16] The committee reported that interviewed senior faculty members and high level administrators described a widespread fear of the administration due to retaliations against faculty that criticized the administration. Interviewed faculty also indicated adverse effects of staff reductions on the Miller School faculty’s ability to deliver care and to conduct both basic and clinical research. Faculty also stated that the pressure to produce clinical income is compromising the academic environment by discouraging and devaluing research and, as a consequence, morale was exceedingly low. The committee recommended a formal senate resolution to urge the Miller School and its Faculty Council to work together to address the highly destructive influence of the absence of a collegial environment. On January 2013, the Miami Herald reported[17] that an estimated 700 of the 1200 faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have signed a petition complaining about the school’s leadership. A copy of the petition obtained by The Herald stated that faculty decried the “failed leadership” of Dean Pascal Goldschmidt and Chief Operating Officer Jack Lord, stating that “We want to make clear that the faculty has lost confidence in the ability of these men to lead the school.” In a ballot conducted by the university in 2013, a majority of faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine voted against Dr. Goldschmidt's retention as Dean and were overruled by the university's president, Donna Shalala, who decided to retain Dr. Goldschmidt.[18]

Career[edit]
Goldschmidt joined University of Miami in April 2006, and oversaw the purchase of Cedars Medical Center in November 2007, which is now University of Miami Hospital, the flagship hospital of UHealth. Following the layoff of 800 employees in June 2012, this rapid expansion was reported to be a contributing factor to Miller Medical School's financial troubles,[1] but is a trend seen in various health systems across the country. He also established the first internal medicine residency training program in Palm Beach County.[citation needed]
New global health clinical and research initiatives include the Global Institute for Community Health and Development and the International Medicine Institute. It was through the Global Institute for Community Health and Development that Goldschmidt was able to launch and oversee the medical relief effort in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake. A team of Miller School physicians, nurses and staff was the first to arrive in Port-au-Prince, and within nine days of the earthquake the University of Miami Hospital in Haiti was open and treating patients.
Research and Awards[edit]
The research enterprise has also grown significantly since 2006 with the creation of the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics and the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute. Both institutes are headed by world-renowned researchers.[citation needed]
In October 2008, Goldschmidt received the inaugural Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein Prize[2] in Cardiovascular Sciences from the Ohio State University Heart and Vascular Center. The prize is awarded biennially to an international leader in the clinical sciences of cardiovascular medicine, cardiothoracic surgery, or the basic sciences of molecular or cellular cardiology.
Goldschmidt's research applies genomics and cell therapy to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. His studies[3] involve Reactive oxygen species, Inflammation, Small GTP-Binding Proteins, hypertrophy, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Goldschmidt was previously chairman of the Department of Medicine at Duke University Medical Center.[4] Before taking the chairman’s role, he served as chief of Duke University's Division of Cardiology.[5]
Before joining the Duke faculty in 2000, he was director of cardiology at Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health, where he built the Heart and Lung Research Institute and a heart hospital.
A native of Belgium, Goldschmidt received his medical degree from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles and completed residency and fellowship training in Brussels at Hôpital Erasme and in the United States at Johns Hopkins University. Following his training at Hopkins, he served as an associate professor in the university’s Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Department of Pathology, and Division of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine until 1997.[6]
Reporting outside income and conflict of interest issues[edit]
Goldschmidt was instrumental in the development and implementation of the University of Miami public database on conflict of interest for all faculty at the Miller School of Medicine, one of the very few US medical school to provide such public information, and ahead of any requests to do so from the National Institute of Health.[citation needed]. However,the information in this public faculty disclosure database ceased to be updated after December 2011.[7] An article evaluating public disclosure of outside income by medical school deans reported that Goldschmidt did not publicly disclose stock options from companies where he served on the board of directors in 2009 (OPKO and MEDNAX).[8][9] In a 2010 proxy statement,[10] MEDNAX disclosed that until September 2009, Dr. Medel, MEDNAX’s Chief Executive Officer, served on the Trustee Services Committee for the University of Miami and participated in setting performance goals and annual bonus allocations for University of Miami employees, including Goldschmidt. It is claimed that the 2010 version of the reporting system did not have the option to disclose unexercised stock options, making it impossible to disclose unexercised stock options for the period from 6/1/2010 – 5/31/2011; the option was later added in the 2011 version[citation needed]. Income of $1,713,300.00 and $605,658 from sale of MEDNAX stocks on 5/9/2014 and 3/9/2015 remains undisclosed.[11][12] The subject of conflict of interest also arose in 2010, when Goldschmidt hired psychiatrist Charles Nemeroff as chair of psychiatry, one year after Nemeroff was ousted as psychiatry chair at Emory University after a probe led by Senator Charles Grassley revealed he had failed to declare at least US$1.2 million in income from drug companies.[13][14] During 6/1/2010 - 12/31/2011, Goldschmidt's outside income from serving on boards of directors is reported[7] as: $50,001-$100,000 from Health Management Associates, $50,001-$100,000 from MEDNAX, More than $200,000 from OPKO Health and $10,001 - $25,000 from Synecor (Scientific Advisory Board). Goldschmidt's salary was $1,072,117 in 2009-2010, $1,312,960 in 2010-2011 and $1,447,160 in 2011-2012.[15]
Faculty Senate Committee on Medical Issues[edit]
On August 2012, the University of Miami Faculty Senate Ad Hoc committee on medical issues presented its report to UM president, Donna Shalala, and to Dean Pascal Goldschmidt.[16] The committee reported that interviewed senior faculty members and high level administrators described a widespread fear of the administration due to retaliations against faculty that criticized the administration. Interviewed faculty also indicated adverse effects of staff reductions on the Miller School faculty’s ability to deliver care and to conduct both basic and clinical research. Faculty also stated that the pressure to produce clinical income is compromising the academic environment by discouraging and devaluing research and, as a consequence, morale was exceedingly low. The committee recommended a formal senate resolution to urge the Miller School and its Faculty Council to work together to address the highly destructive influence of the absence of a collegial environment. On January 2013, the Miami Herald reported[17] that an estimated 700 of the 1200 faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have signed a petition complaining about the school’s leadership. A copy of the petition obtained by The Herald stated that faculty decried the “failed leadership” of Dean Pascal Goldschmidt and Chief Operating Officer Jack Lord, stating that “We want to make clear that the faculty has lost confidence in the ability of these men to lead the school.” In a ballot conducted by the university in 2013, a majority of faculty at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine voted against Dr. Goldschmidt's retention as Dean and were overruled by the university's president, Donna Shalala, who decided to retain Dr. Goldschmidt.[18]

I went in for my first visit yesterday and it was a very nice surprise.LOCATION- the office is located in a large intersection- the Regions Bank Building on 36th and Biscayne so its impossible to miss it! Parking is free and offices are tidy! STAFF- the reason why i chose this DR to begin with was the service i got over the phone- i went through a list of places and most places had really unprofessional and rude receptionists- at which case i hung up and tried a different number until BINGO! i hit this office. The receptionist is very polite and soft spoken. She is very professional and just a pleasure to speak to! Very nice and friendly -first PLUS!I did wait a little longer than usual but the front desk young lady told me that my insurance was having technical difficulties and she couldn't get in touch with them. They had a nice big flat screen TV in the reception which made my wait barely noticeable.DR- She is extremely nice and polite. So genuinely concerned and listened to all my crazy rants and medical history ups and downs. She was very receptive to all my comments and offered great advice and even helped me with recommendations on other specialists i should see. She even had the front desk girl make copies  with specialist information and wrote referrals so i wouldn't have any problems with my insurance covering my services. She also took down the names of all my prescription meds and found cheaper alternatives and then sent them directly to my pharmacy so i wouldn't even have to bother dropping them off WOW! this place is really amazing and understands people and how to take care of them and their needs. I would most definitely recommend this place 100%Christopher Hodgkins MDAlex D. ratedMy experience with Dr. Hodgkins & his staff are excellent!! I was supposed to do a 70.3 at the end of the month of Sept  in Augusta Georgia  and 3 week prior my race broke my ankle while training on my cycling bike on 9/3/2016 had surgery on 9/6/16. I was devastated  and I couldn't  believe it that this was happening  to me so I left it in god hand. Since I did already sign up for a full Ironman 140.6  in Nov-2016 and the race is for Nov 2017,  I was scare to death that was going to able to compete on  this race, I did ask the Dr. if I was able to run again, and he told me I would be back to normal within the six month is only been 5 month and one week and I  been swimming, cycling and running on the treadmill 3 to 5 miles twice a week and today he gave me the news that I wanted to hear that I could run in the pavement, I thank god everyday how lucky I am to have this Dr. come thru my path and perform surgery and his staff for taking care of me.From the bottom of  my Heart THANK YOU!!!!  Dr. Hodgkins and your staff!! Alex D.Pazmino, Byron, MDAnto G. ratedI was very nervous about a facelift because of so many horror stories I've heard & seen but my daughter n law had a tummy tuck with Dr. Pazmino so when I saw how great he was with her I knew I had found my surgeon . His hands are blessed !! I'm a few days out & the staff has really gone above & beyond for me . I feel so comfortable . When I first got there I met Cathy who really made the financial part of this surgery possible . Then , I met Jesenia who I had spoken to on the phone before & really made me feel confident about what I was about to do going over some details about the procedure. Finally I had my visit before my surgery I met Malena who went over what to expect & how I can best get ready for the surgery . I have truly had a smooth experience . I'm 3 days out and I'm barely bruised & feel great but if I feel & look great now , then I can only imagine in a few weeks ! So excited to get some of my youth back .Christopher Hodgkins MDOscar A. ratedDr. Hodgkins is a true professional and an amazing surgeon. I fractured my ankle and when I visited Dr Hodgkins he explained everything in great detail and was there to answer every question I had. I never felt rushed. His bedside manners were great. I knew that he would be the doctor to operate me. The follow up post surgery was awesome. They followed up to see if I felt good and if I had any questions for the doctor. 17 weeks post surgery I feel great! The office appointments are very punctual If your appointment is at 330pm, you are in at 330pm! They never make you wait more than 10 min.  The operation was a total success. People see me walking now and cant believe I had surgery just a few weeks ago! I would definitely recommend Dr Hodgkins to anyone who needs ankle surgery.Carlos E. Wiegering, MDUrsula A. ratedMe hace feliz compartir mi testimonio con todos ustedes sobre mi experiencia con el Dr. Carlos Wiegering., como cirujano plástico; tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo ademas de atenderme con el y a partir de ese momento mi felicidad fue inmensa, no solo por los resultados que fueron excelentes sino por el servicio que allí me prestaron desde el mismo momento en que llegue a sus instalaciones.El Doctor Carlos Wiegering brinda una seguridad y confianza a todos sus pacientes, lo que se hace fácil decidirse en operarse con él . Recomiendo al Doctor Carlos Wiegering , por su profesionalismo, su calidad humana y por su equipo de trabajo que es sin duda alguna el mejor. Reitero mi cariño y satisfacción y les envió un saludo muy especial al Doctor y todos sus colaboradores.DR Christian Gonzalezambercs ratedThe best in AventuraDr. Gonzalez's staff was extremely complementary, I felt a true sense of care from the moment I walked into the office. All of his front office staff are extremely knowledgeable and compassionate... and that is truly hard to find these days! Dr. Gonzalez took his time with me and answered all of my questions, and fit me in his schedule even though I didn't have an appointment. I had to have an injection in my back and was very nervous,  but Dr. Gonzalez took my mind off the procedure,  and before I knew it, it was over. Dr. Gonzalez has outstanding bedside manner and I would recommend him to ANYONE who has back problems. Hands down Dr. Gonzalez is one of the BEST physicians I have seen in a very long time!Christopher Hodgkins MDBarbra H. ratedDr. Hodgkins is AMAZING!  My husband and my daughter are both patients of his.  My husband had a serious accident 2 years ago and Dr. Hodgkins went above and beyond to care for him.  It was a long recovery and he was with my husband every step of the way.  My daughter has had two injuries within the last year and a half and we went to him immediately for both injuries.  We have also recommended him to several friends and others that have reached out to us for a recommendation.  He is an AMAZING doctor who we have the upmost respect for!  Also, his office staff, especially Jen, are awesome.  She is efficient and on top of things!  We have never had a bad experience with this office.Ojea Juan CarlosGregg M. ratedWas treated like crap. I don't know if it was because he had a bad day at his job at the hospital or what. But I've never been treated so rudely by a doctor. Sit in his office for five hours waiting for him to show up. I was forced to bend and move which was very painful, especially after sitting in that hard chair for five hours. Just to be talked to and treated like crap. He didn't even look at my records, only went by what his nurses put in the file. The urine test was completely wrong. I honestly think he was just having a bad day, surely he doesn't treat people he doesn't know like that. Christopher Hodgkins MDE K. ratedI am 60 years old and Dr Hodgkins is probably the best Dr I have ever been to. He is an excellent surgeon and excels at his profession - I broke my ankle and had to have 12 screws, 1 large plate, 2 buttons and a trapeze to hold it all together. I have basically had no pain since 2 days postop. His bedside manner is incredible and he really wants his patients to be happy and he and his staff work very hard to achieve that. I have never written a review for a medical professional but he is so fabulous that he and his staff deserve my highest compliments.Christopher Hodgkins MDOliver R. ratedAmazing experience from dr.hodgkins for my first experience in the ER at 28. I had contracted a case of mrsa in my right knee. Dr.hodgekins expertly worked on my knee, and made sure that I would not go anywhere until the infection was taken care of. He always looked out for my safety and health. I truly felt in good hands the whole time while the doctor and his team took care of me. Even though it was a painful the experience was pleasant and got taken care of because of them. I am super grateful and happy I ended up in their care.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
