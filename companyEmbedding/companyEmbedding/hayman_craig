NEEDHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PTC 
      (NASDAQ: PTC) today announced the appointment of Craig Hayman to a newly 
      created role of chief operating officer (COO), effective immediately. 
      Hayman has served as group president of the Solutions Group at PTC since 
      late 2015. In this new COO role, Hayman will be responsible for 
      engineering, marketing, and sales and distribution of PTC’s ThingWorx® 
      technology platform as well as its computer aided design, and product 
      and service lifecycle management solutions. Hayman will continue to 
      report directly to PTC president and chief executive officer Jim 
      Heppelmann.
    


      As group president, Hayman has overseen a resurgence in PTC’s core 
      solutions businesses while driving a majority of the sales of the 
      company’s IoT technology platform. Hayman also led the successful 
      introduction of a new generation of connected applications for the 
      factory and product development, including the Navigate™ 
      connected application, the fastest growing new product line in the 
      company’s history.
    

      "When Craig joined PTC, he brought an incredible level of operational 
      discipline, which he has successfully used to re-energize our core 
      business, while contributing significantly to the growth of our 
      ThingWorx platform,” said Heppelmann. “We are elevating Craig’s role 
      with full confidence that his strong operational skills will position us 
      to continue our solid performance across the breadth of our businesses."
    

      An accomplished technology executive, Hayman has more than 30 years of 
      deep managerial expertise and leadership experience in enterprise 
      technology, including cloud-based platforms and solutions. Prior to 
      joining PTC, Hayman was president of eBay Enterprise, a global provider 
      of retail-optimized, omni-channel commerce solutions. Hayman also served 
      for more than 15 years in senior leadership positions at IBM, including 
      as worldwide general manager of IBM's SaaS portfolio.
    

      "I’ve been amazed at the pace of innovation and transformation happening 
      here at PTC,” said Hayman. "The leading-edge technology we’re delivering 
      across all our businesses is accelerating our customers’ ability to 
      capitalize on their market opportunities. I am excited to further 
      contribute to PTC’s success during this important time in the company’s 
      history.”
    

      Separately, PTC announced the planned departure of Rob Gremley, who has 
      served as group president of the Technology Platform Group since 2014. 
      He will remain in an advisory role during a transition period.
    

      "Over the past 25 years, Rob has served in leadership roles in sales, 
      marketing, and services, and most recently helped organize our company 
      around the high-growth IoT opportunity,” said Heppelmann. “We are 
      grateful for the tremendous contributions he has made to our success."
    

About PTC (NASDAQ: PTC)PTC has the most robust Internet of 
      Things technology in the world. In 1986 we revolutionized digital 3D 
      design, and in 1998 were first to market with Internet-based PLM. Now 
      our leading IoT and AR platform and field-proven solutions bring 
      together the physical and digital worlds to reinvent the way you create, 
      operate, and service products. With PTC, global manufacturers and an 
      ecosystem of partners and developers can capitalize on the promise of 
      the IoT today and drive the future of innovation.

PTC Promotes Craig Hayman to Chief Operating Officer

            Newly Created Role to Lead Operations Across Company’s Platform and Solutions Businesses
        
NEEDHAM, Mass. – February 1, 2017 – PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) today announced the appointment of Craig Hayman to a newly created role of chief operating officer (COO), effective immediately. Hayman has served as group president of the Solutions Group at PTC since late 2015. In this new COO role, Hayman will be responsible for engineering, marketing, and sales and distribution of PTC’s ThingWorx® technology platform as well as its computer aided design, and product and service lifecycle management solutions. Hayman will continue to report directly to PTC president and chief executive officer Jim Heppelmann.
As group president, Hayman has overseen a resurgence in PTC’s core solutions businesses while driving a majority of the sales of the company’s IoT technology platform. Hayman also led the successful introduction of a new generation of connected applications for the factory and product development, including the Navigate™ connected application, the fastest growing new product line in the company’s history.
"When Craig joined PTC, he brought an incredible level of operational discipline, which he has successfully used to re-energize our core business, while contributing significantly to the growth of our ThingWorx platform,” said Heppelmann. “We are elevating Craig’s role with full confidence that his strong operational skills will position us to continue our solid performance across the breadth of our businesses."
An accomplished technology executive, Hayman has more than 30 years of deep managerial expertise and leadership experience in enterprise technology, including cloud-based platforms and solutions. Prior to joining PTC, Hayman was president of eBay Enterprise, a global provider of retail-optimized, omni-channel commerce solutions. Hayman also served for more than 15 years in senior leadership positions at IBM, including as worldwide general manager of IBM's SaaS portfolio.
"I’ve been amazed at the pace of innovation and transformation happening here at PTC,” said Hayman. "The leading-edge technology we’re delivering across all our businesses is accelerating our customers’ ability to capitalize on their market opportunities. I am excited to further contribute to PTC’s success during this important time in the company’s history.”
Separately, PTC announced the planned departure of Rob Gremley, who has served as group president of the Technology Platform Group since 2014. He will remain in an advisory role during a transition period.
"Over the past 25 years, Rob has served in leadership roles in sales, marketing, and services, and most recently helped organize our company around the high-growth IoT opportunity,” said Heppelmann. “We are grateful for the tremendous contributions he has made to our success."
 
About PTC (NASDAQ: PTC)
PTC has the most robust Internet of Things technology in the world. In 1986 we revolutionized digital 3D design, and in 1998 were first to market with Internet-based PLM. Now our leading IoT and AR platform and field-proven solutions bring together the physical and digital worlds to reinvent the way you create, operate, and service products.

Putting the Customer First
I spent yesterday at the National Retail Federation’s Annual Convention and Expo in New York City. It’s affectionately known as “retail’s big show,” a description that truly captures the spirit of the event.

Social Business Meets Smarter Commerce
I went to the movies recently to see Skyfall, the latest offering from the Bond franchise.

Cyber Monday Is More Important than Ever
It’s the Monday after Thanksgiving and most everyone is back in the office.

The Cyber Monday—the first Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend—first emerged as a shopping phenomenon in 2005. […]

How Analytics Forever Changed Holiday Shopping
There was a time not that long ago, really, when savvy shoppers waited eagerly for the day after Thanksgiving.

“The revolution will not be televised.” So the protest movement of the 1960s proclaimed.

CMOs: Marketing to the “One,” not the “Billions”
I was channel surfing the other night and caught a glimpse of a Wendy’s commercial.

CMOs Take Note: Why Commerce is All about Customer Collaboration
Perhaps because it’s an election year, I found myself recently spending a quiet weekend afternoon thinking about Team of Rivals, by Pulitzer-prize winning historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin.

From Google to Facebook: How CMOs Are Thinking About Social
There’s something of a mini media firestorm brewing. Apparently a former Google engineer, James Whittaker, has written a blog post about why he left Google.
