Purchase Carbon Offsets


Carbon Offsets 
Purchasing Guide

Through the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative, the Duke community can purchase carbon offsets to zero out carbon emissions.
Purchasing takes just a few easy steps:
First, select what kind of emissions you would like to offset from the options below.  For example, if you are interested in offsets to count against your personal carbon footprint, choose the individual icon.  For meetings and special events, click the meeting icon.  For departmental emissions, click on the building icon.  
Second, enter your NetID and password.
Third, complete the carbon calculator that matches the type of offsets you need to estimate your carbon footprint.  For air travel, please use one of the external calculators listed on page 6 of the DCOI Carbon Offsets Purchasing Guide.
Fourth, select "Purchase Offsets" and enter the number of offsets you would like to buy.  The DCOI sells carbon offsets by the ton (no partial ton sales allowed) at a price of $10/metric ton of CO2 equivalents. Purchases can be made with a credit card through one of the links below.
NOTE: When you pay by credit card, you will be asked to sign in to your Event Management account.  If you do not already have an account with Event Management, registration takes only a few moments.
