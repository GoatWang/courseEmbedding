Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

Biofuels – production of biodiesel and its co-products and ethanol-related activities such as equity investments, production and trading of ethanol, sugar and the excess electricity generated from sugarcane bagasse

Production and reserves[edit]
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 16 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[1]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Refinery in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which was nationalized by the Bolivian government in 2007


Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]

The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]
Ownership[edit]
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

Production and reserves[edit]
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 16 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[1]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Refinery in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which was nationalized by the Bolivian government in 2007


Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]
Ownership[edit]
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

Production and reserves[edit]
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 16 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[1]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]
Ownership[edit]
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]
History[edit]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

Production and reserves[edit]
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 16 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[1]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Refinery in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which was nationalized by the Bolivian government in 2007


Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]
Ownership[edit]
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]

In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

Business areas[edit]
The company operates in six business areas, listed in order of revenue:[1]

Refining, transportation and marketing – refining, logistics, transportation, trading operations, oil products and crude oil exports and imports and petrochemical investments in Brazil
Exploration and production – crude oil, NGL and natural gas exploration, development and production in Brazil
Distribution – distribution of oil products, ethanol, biodiesel and natural gas to wholesalers and through the Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. retail network in Brazil
Gas and power – transportation and trading of natural gas and LNG, and generation and trading of electric power, and the fertilizer business

Biofuels – production of biodiesel and its co-products and ethanol-related activities such as equity investments, production and trading of ethanol, sugar and the excess electricity generated from sugarcane bagasse

Production and reserves[edit]
Petrobras controls significant oil and energy assets in 16 countries in Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[1]
However, Brazil represented 92% of Petrobras' worldwide production in 2014 and accounted for 97% of Petrobras' worldwide reserves on 31 December 2014,[1] when the company had 8,112.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.9633×1010 GJ) of proved developed reserves and 4,599.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.8140×1010 GJ) of proved undeveloped reserves in Brazil.[1] Of these, 62.7% were located in the offshore Campos Basin.[1] The largest growth prospect for the company is the Lula oil field in the Santos Basin.[1]
In 2015, the company produced 2.284 million barrels of oil equivalent (13,970,000 GJ) per day, of which 89% was petroleum and 11% was natural gas.[1]
International investments[edit]

Refinery in Cochabamba, Bolivia, which was nationalized by the Bolivian government in 2007


Reserves held outside of Brazil accounted for 8.4% of production in 2014.[1] The majority of these reserves are in South America; the company has assets in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[1]
Petrobras owns refineries in Texas (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), Okinawa, Japan (100,000 barrels per day of throughput), and Bahía Blanca, Argentina (30,000 barrels per day of throughput).[1]
The company also owns exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and through joint ventures has production in Nigeria, Benin, Gabon, and Namibia.[1]
Ownership[edit]
The Brazilian government directly owns 54% of Petrobras' common shares with voting rights, while the Brazilian Development Bank and Brazil's Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano) each control 5%, bringing the State's direct and indirect ownership to 64%.[7] The privately held shares are traded on BM&F Bovespa, where they are part of the Ibovespa index.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Petrobras is a major supporter of the arts in Brazil.[8]
History[edit]

Corporate milestones[edit]
Petrobras was created in 1953 under the government of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas with the slogan "The Oil is Ours" (Portuguese: "O petróleo é nosso") and was given a legal monopoly in Brazil.[9] In 1953, Brazil only produced 2,700 barrels of oil per day.[10] In 1961, the company's REDUC refinery began operations near Rio de Janeiro,[11] and in 1963, its Cenpes research center opened in Rio de Janeiro; it remains one of the world's largest centers dedicated to energy research.[12] In 1967, the company established Petrobras Quimica S.A ("Petroquisa"), a subsidiary focused on petrochemicals and the conversion of naphtha into ethene.[13]
Petrobras had begun began processing oil shale in 1953, developing the Petrosix technology for extracting oil from oil shale but began using an industrial-size retort to process shale in the 1990s.[14] In 2006, Petrobras said that the industrial retort had the capacity to process 260 tonnes/hour of oil shale.[15]
In 1994, Petrobras put into service the Petrobras 36, the world's largest oil platform. It sank after an explosion in 2001 and was a complete loss.[16] In 1997, the government approved Law N.9.478, which broke Petrobras's monopoly and allowed competitors to develop Brazil's oilfields, and also created the National Petroleum Agency (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, ANP), responsible for the regulation and supervision of activities in the petroleum industry, and the National Council of Energy Policies, a public agency responsible for developing public energy policy.[17] In 1999, the National Petroleum Agency signed agreements with other companies, making the final end of the company's monopoly.[18]
In 2000, Petrobras set a world record for oil exploration in deep waters, reaching a depth of 1,877 metres (6,158 ft) below sea level.[19] In 2002, Petrobras acquired the Argentine company Perez Companc Energía (PECOM Energía S.A.) from the Perez Companc Family Group (es) and its family foundation for $1.18 billion. This acquisition included assets in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador, 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil reserves and production of 181 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,110,000 GJ) per day.[20]
In 2005, Petrobras announced a joint venture with Nippon Alcohol Hanbai to sell ethanol from Brazil to Japan, called Brazil-Japan Ethanol.[21] On 21 April 2006, the company started production on the P-50 oil platform in the Albacora East field at Campos Basin, which made Brazil self-sufficienct in oil production.[10] By November 2015, the company had accumulated $128 billion in debt, 84% of it denominated in foreign currencies.[22]
Production[edit]
In 1961, Petrobras geologist Walter K. Link published Link's memorandum, which implied that the company was better off exploring offshore instead of onshore.[23] In 1963, Petrobras discovered the Recôncavo baiano (pt) and Carmópolis oil fields.[17]
The company's growth was halted by the 1973 oil crisis. The entire country was affected, and the "Brazilian miracle", a period when annual GDP growth exceeding 10%, ended. Petrobras nearly went bankrupt.[24] In 1974, the company discovered an oil field in the Campos Basin. This discovery boosted its finances and helped it restructure nationwide.[25] In 1975, the Brazilian Government temporarily allowed foreign operators into Brazil, and Petrobras signed contracts with foreign companies to explore for more oilfields in Brazil.[26]
The company was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis, although not nearly as badly as in 1973.
In 1997, Petrobras reached the production milestone of 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. The company also executed agreements with other Latin American governments and began operations outside Brazil.[27]
In 2003, on its 50-year anniversary, Petrobras surpassed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (12,000,000 GJ) of daily production.[27] On 1 May 2006, after the Bolivian gas conflict, Bolivia's president Evo Morales announced the nationalization of all gas and oil fields in the country and ordered the occupation of all fields by the Bolivian Army.[28] On 4 May 2006, Petrobras cancelled a major future investment plan in Bolivia as a result.[29] The Bolivian government demanded an increase in royalty payments from foreign petroleum companies to 82%, but eventually settled for a 50% royalty interest.[30]
In 2007, Petrobras inaugurated the Petrobras 52 Oil Platform. The 52 is the biggest Brazilian oil platform and the third-biggest in the world.[31]
In 2007 and 2008, Petrobras made several major oil discoveries including the Lula oil field (formerly known as the Tupi field), the Jupiter field, and the Sugar Loaf field, all in the Santos Basin, 300 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The oil fields were discovered by partnerships that include Petrobras, Royal Dutch Shell, and Galp Energia. However, estimates of reserves in these new fields varied widely.[32]




Oil platform P-51, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform


The P-51 Platform, the first semisubmersible platform built entirely in Brazil, capable of producing up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day, started production in the Campos Basin in January 2009,[33] and in February 2009, China agreed to loan Petrobras US$10 billion in exchange for a supply of 60,000-100,000 barrels of oil per day to a subsidiary of Sinopec and 40,000-60,000 barrels of oil per day to PetroChina.[34] In August 2009, Petrobras acquired ExxonMobil's Esso assets in Chile for US$400 million.[35]
In September 2010, Petrobras completed a US$70 billion share offering, the largest share offering in history, to be used to develop newly discovered oil fields.[36]
In 2012, Petrobras handed back permits that it had to explore offshore in New Zealand.[37][why?]
In July 2013, a worker strike action shut down production at several of the company's oil platforms.[38] In September 2013, Petrobras sold eleven onshore exploration and production blocks in Colombia to Perenco for US$380 million.[39] In September 2013 Organizações Globo reported on national televisionthat the US government had been spying on Petrobras. This information was reportedly provided by US journalist Glenn Greenwald.[40] Petrobras announced that it was investing R$21 billion over five years to improve its data security.[41]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in Peru to PetroChina for US$2.6 billion.[42] Also in 2014, Petrobras set a new company record for average daily production of 2.863 million barrels of oil equivalent (17,520,000 GJ).[43]
Operation Car Wash and related protests in Brazil[edit]
Main article: Operation Car Wash
Main article: 2015 protests in Brazil
In 2014, the largest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil, centered around Petrobras, was uncovered. According to the investigation, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with an organized cartel of 16 companies to overcharge Petrobras for construction and service work in return for bribes and kickbacks. Petrobras officials pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion. As of August 2015, 117 indictments had been issued, five politicians arrested, and criminal cases brought against 13 companies. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who had promised to reduce corruption in her election campaign, and former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva both served on the board of directors of Petrobras during the scandals and were both blamed, as well as the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was sentenced in March 2017 to 15 years in prison.[44] Rousseff was impeached and Lula was implicated in multiple corruption investigations.[45] The scandal sparked protests in Brazil.[46]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sued Petrobras and its auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers as a result of the corruption scandal.[47]
Environmental record[edit]
Petrobras has noted on its website several initiatives that it has taken to preserve the environment. These include sponsoring efforts to support both ocean and forest ecosystems.[48]
Petrobras subscribes to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary agreement which encompasses a set of principles regarding human rights, working conditions, corruption, and the environment.[49]
In 2008, the Spanish consultancy firm Management and Excellence acknowledged Petrobras as the world's most sustainable oil company.[50]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
