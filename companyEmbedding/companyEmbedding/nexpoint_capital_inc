NexPoint Capital, Inc. Announces Tender Offer For Common Stock
Posted: July 5, 2017

DALLAS, July 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — NexPoint Capital, Inc. (the “Company”), a non-traded publicly registered business development company and affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P., today announced the expiration and final results for its tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) for up to 2.5% of its outstanding common stock (“Shares”) at a price equal to 90% of the offering price per Share in effect on the Expiration Date (as…

(1) There is no assurance that these objectives will be met. The company has a limited operating history and no established financing sources. As a result, an investment in the company is speculative. In addition, investors in the company will not acquire an interest in Highland Capital Management.
(2) Distributions are not guaranteed and may be suspended, modified or terminated at the discretion of the board of directors. Distributions may include a return of principal or borrowed funds, which may lower overall returns to the investor and may not be sustainable.
(3) The annualized distribution rate is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated above without compounding), divided by the price quote per share as of the date indicated above. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. As of the quarter ending December 31, 2016, 100% of distributions were paid from net investment income from operations. The distributions described herein were funded in significant part by the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of investment advisory fees that may be subject to repayment to NexPoint Advisors, and the company’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers or reimbursements. Significant portions of these distributions were not based on our investment performance and such waivers and reimbursements by NexPoint Advisors may not continue in the future. If NexPoint Advisors does not agree to reimburse certain of our expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of any amounts owed to NexPoint Advisors will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled. The determination of the tax attributes of NexPoint Capital’s distributions is made annually as of the end of NexPoint Capital’s fiscal year based upon its taxable income and distributions paid, in each case, for the full year. Therefore, a determination as to the tax attributes of the distributions made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders will be reported to shareholders annually on a Form 1099-DIV. Distributions are not guaranteed and may be suspended, modified or terminated at the discretion of the board of directors. Distributions may include a return of principal or borrowed funds, which may lower overall returns to the investor and may not be sustainable.

Risk Factors







Investing in our shares of common stock may be considered speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. See the “Risk Factors” section of our prospectus to read about the risks you should consider before buying our shares including the risk of leverage.
The public offering price of NexPoint Capital’s common stock is subject to a sales load of up to 8% and offering expenses of up to 1%. Estimated annual fund expenses as a percentage of the average net assets attributable to common stock are 6.6%. Expenses and fees are described more fully in the prospectus. Annual expense ratio calculated as set forth in the prospectus and based on public offering price in effect on such date. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully.

You should not expect to be able to sell your shares of common stock regardless of how we perform.
If you are able to sell your shares of common stock, you will likely receive less than your purchase price.
We do not intend to list our shares of common stock on any securities exchange during, or for what may be a significant time after, the offering period, and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares of common stock to develop.
Because our common stock will not be listed on a securities exchange, you may be unable to sell your shares and, as a result, you may be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn.
We intend to implement a share repurchase program, but we do not expect to repurchase more than 10% of the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding in the prior calendar year. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a 10% discount to the current offering price in effect on the date of repurchase.
Our distributions may be funded from offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to us for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of sales load, fees and expenses and such amounts will not be recoverable by our stockholders.
You should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. An investment in our shares of common stock is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest. See “Share Repurchase Program,” “Suitability Standards” and “Liquidity Strategy.”
The lack of experience of our investment adviser operating under the constraints imposed on us as a business development company and RIC may hinder the achievement of our investment objective.
We intend to finance our investments with borrowed money, which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.
We are subject to risks associated with middle-market healthcare companies, including competition, extensive government regulation and commercial difficulties.
Our CLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us and our stockholders than direct investments in the underlying companies. Our investments in equity and mezzanine tranches of CLOs will likely be subordinate to the other debt tranches of such CLOs, and are subject to a higher degree of risk of total loss.
There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns.

Overview







Healthcare is the largest component of the American economy, accounting for more than 17.2 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. It is also the fastest growing segment, forecast to increase above 20 percent of GDP in the next few years. (Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012)*
In the midst of this growth, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA” or as commonly referred to as “Obamacare”) is driving dynamic changes to the healthcare economy as it transforms patient access to care while modernizing and reengineering the current infrastructure of medical delivery.
We believe the changes precipitated by the implementation of the ACA will result in “winners” that are able to effectively adapt and thrive in the new environment, as well as “losers” that are unable to access the necessary capital and expertise to compete.
For investors, this historic period of change may offer significant opportunity to those able to identify the difference between those firms able to thrive and those that will struggle.
NexPoint Capital is a healthcare focused BDC (business development company) sponsored by NexPoint Advisors, an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. Highland Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliate advisors (together “Highland”) is an institutional investment firm with approximately $13.4 billion of assets under management with particular expertise in the healthcare sector.
We believe that with Highland’s specialized expertise, we will be able to successfully identify the “winners” and to provide NexPoint Capital investors with a unique opportunity to potentially benefit from the ongoing strength and historic change in the quickly evolving healthcare sector.**
 
*There is no assurance that the healthcare industry will experience growth in line with this forecast.
**Prior performance is no guarantee of future results.
