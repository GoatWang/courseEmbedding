DENVER, March  22, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ:AIRM) (“Air Methods” or the “Company”), the global leader in air medical transportation, today announced that it has entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Voce Capital Management LLC (“Voce”), under which Air Methods will expand the size of its Board of Directors and add Voce nominee Joseph E. Whitters as a new independent director, effective immediately. Mr. Whitters will also be appointed to the Board’s Finance and Strategic Planning Committee and will stand for election to the Board as part of the Company’s slate of director nominees at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. With the addition of Mr. Whitters, the Air Methods Board now includes 12 directors, 11 of whom are independent. And upon the retirement from the Board of George W. Belsey and Carl H. McNair, Major General (Ret.) following the expiration of their terms at the 2016 Annual Meeting, the Air Methods Board will consist of 10 directors, nine of whom will be independent. In connection with the agreement, the Board has also approved – and will seek shareholder approval at the 2016 Annual Meeting to adopt – a binding proposal to amend the Company’s certification of incorporation and bylaws to declassify its Board of Directors, such that all directors will be elected annually commencing with the Class II directors up for re-election at the 2017 Annual Meeting. As part of this process, Aaron Todd, Air Methods Chief Executive Officer, will once again serve as a Class II director and stand for re-election at the 2017 Annual Meeting. “We appreciate the constructive input we have received from Voce. Air Methods has long benefited from a strong Board that comprises industry leaders, and we are pleased to welcome Joe Whitters as a new independent director,” said C. David Kikumoto, Chairman of the Air Methods Board of Directors. “We are confident that he will add valuable healthcare investment perspective to our Board as together we help guide Air Methods’ continued execution of its strategic initiatives to drive growth and shareholder value.” “As a longtime Air Methods investor, we believe the Board will benefit from Joe’s considerable skills and experience,” said J. Daniel Plants, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Voce. “We look forward to continuing to work constructively with the Air Methods Board and management team to enhance value for all shareholders.  We also commend the Board for agreeing to bring Voce’s shareholder proposal to de-stagger the Board to a vote at the 2016 annual meeting.” Pursuant to its agreement with Air Methods, Voce has agreed to certain customary standstill and voting provisions. The agreement will be filed on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. About Joseph E.
