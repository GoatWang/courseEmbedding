Nasdaq (NDAQ) Q2 Earnings: What Lies Ahead for the Stock?


July 24, 2017, 10:08:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Nasdaq, Inc. NDAQ  is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.76%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Factors to be Considered this Quarter    Nasdaq is likely to report bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher revenues and better-than-expected performance across all the segments. Also, continued share buybacks should have boosted its bottom line.      The securities exchange's net revenue growth can be attributable to net revenues from the company's 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, along with organic growth in the non-trading segments.    Further, the company has likely achieved a substantial amount of annualized run rate cost synergies across the aforementioned four 2016 acquisitions. Notably, the securities exchange is anticipated to deliver on the full synergy potential of $60 million by the end of 2017.      However, Nasdaq has likely reported increased operating expenses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.    With respect to the surprise trend, the company delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.31%.    Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise          Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Nasdaq, Inc. Quote   Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nasdaq is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.   Zacks ESP  : Nasdaq has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 96 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Zacks Rank  : Nasdaq carries a Zacks Rank #3.    Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   Other Stocks to Consider    Some better-ranked companies from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter are as follows:    CNA Financial Corporation CNA  , which is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Jul 31, has an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Sun Life Financial Inc. SLF  has an Earnings ESP of +2.74% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Aug 9.    Manulife Financial Corporation MFC  has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to report its second-quarter earnings on Aug 9.  More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

More than half of the index's 10 most influential gainers were energy names, with Suncor Energy Inc rising 2.2 percent to end at C$38.56. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd added 1.7 percent to C$38.39. Encana Corp jumped 4.7 percent to C$12.53 while Crescent Point Energy Corp surged 8.6 percent to C$9.83. The overall energy group saw its biggest one-day gain in more than two months, rising 3.0 percent. Oil prices jumped nearly 2 percent after a U.S. report showed a bigger weekly draw than expected in crude and gasoline stocks, along with an unexpected drop in distillate inventories. "That caused not only a pop in the oil price, but a group that has been disappointed has now turned around," said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada. "Demand remains very strong even in the so-called summer driving season." U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for August settled up 72 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.12 on its second to last day as the front month. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose 95.14 points, or 0.63 percent, to finish at 15,244.71. Of the index's 10 main groups, eight were in positive territory. Financial services companies gained 0.5 percent, with Manulife Financial Corp up 1.4 percent at C$25.30. Dairy producer Saputo Inc soared 5.0 percent to C$42.42 after RBC raised the company's rating to "outperform" from "perform". Consumer staples rose 0.7 percent. The utilities sector ended up 0.5 percent. Hydro One Ltd stock will likely be in the spotlight on Thursday after the Canadian utility firm announced after markets closed that it will acquired U.S. rival Avista Corp. Canada's two largest railways ended lower, dragging the overall industrials group down 0.6 percent. Canadian Pacific Railway, finished down 1.3 percent at C$203.60. The rail operator posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit after markets closed, attributed to earnings from higher shipments of commodities. In economic data, Canadian manufacturing sales posted the largest gain in five months in May, rising 1.1 percent to C$54.6 billion ($43.2 billion) from April, topping forecasts and hitting a record level on higher sales of motor vehicles and parts, data from Statistics Canada showed. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 169 to 70, for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the upside.

 Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?    One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put Manulife Financial Corporation MFC  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:   PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, Manulife Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.67. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.50.     If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock, the current level puts Manulife Financial's current PE among its lows over the past four years. This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could prove to be a suitable entry point from a PE perspective.    Further, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance - Life Insurance industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.65. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.      We should also point out that Manulife Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 12.32 - which is faintly lower than the current level. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Manulife Financial stock in the near term too.   PS Ratio    Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, Manulife Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.13. This is lower than the Zacks categorized Insurance - Life Insurance industry average, which comes in at 1.42 right now.      MFC is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company's stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.   PEG Ratio    While earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate).The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.    Manulife Financial's PEG ratio stands at 1.25, compared with the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry average of 1.59. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.     Broad Value Outlook    In aggregate, Manulife Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'A', putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Manulife Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.    For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 3.31, which is far better than the industry average of 4.43. Clearly, MFC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though Manulife Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'F' and a Momentum score of 'C'. This gives MFC a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'C'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been trending upwards lately. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward revision and no downward revisions in the same time period.    This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant in the past month, while the full year estimate has increased 1.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:  Manulife Financial Corp Price and Consensus       Manulife Financial Corp Price and Consensus    |      Manulife Financial Corp Quote  This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.  Bottom Line    Manulife Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 19% out of more than 250 industries) and strong Zacks Rank, Manulife Financial looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past one year, the Zacks Insurance - Life Insurance industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:      Meanwhile, Manulife continues to witness new business volumes, particularly in Asia, and positive net flows in its wealth and asset management businesses. Deep reach in the Asian market and a growing asset management business would drive long-term earnings growth for the company.    So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company's prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.

Dividend Investors: Is Manulife Financial Corp. Good for Your Portfolio?

Haris Anwar | July 18, 2017 | More on:  MFC MFC

Canada?s largest insurer has massively outperformed the market in the past year, surging 41% against the S&P/TSX Composite Index’s gains of 4%.

The recent price action in Manulife Financial Corp (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) stock has raised one important question: Is this the time right for long-term investors to get excited about this boring business?
Canada’s largest insurer has massively outperformed the market in the past year, surging 41% against the S&P/TSX Composite Index’s gains of 4%. This remarkable performance reminds me of good, old days almost a decade ago, when the Manulife’s share price peaked at $44, just before the Financial Crisis of 2007.
In the decade that followed, Manulife largely disappointed investors as the company failed to produce noticeable growth or a strategy that generated superior returns for its shareholders.
There are some positive signs lately that suggest that Manulife is beginning to turn the corner.
According to media reports, Manulife is considering spinning off its American unit, either through an initial public offering or an outright sale. Manulife’s acquisition of John Hancock for $15 billion in 2004 proved to be one of the biggest drags on its profitability and share performance. If this strategic move materializes, it will unlock the true value for Manulife shares, setting the stage for an upside potential.
Future growth drivers
A potential move on the U.S. side is one speculative element which is boosting the Manulife’s stock price, but there are some fundamental improvements in the company’s business as well.
The most visible improvements one can see when analyzing Manulife’s financial performance is its expanding the Asian business. In 2016, for example, Asia produced 36% of Manulife’s revenue, almost matching its U.S. revenue and more than what the company produced from its Canadian business.
This strategic shift in the company’s focus to Asia has all the potential to produce a long-term growth as insurance and wealth management markets remain underserved in that region. On its Asian strength, Manulife was able to record a 29% growth in its earning per share in the most recent quarter compared to the same period a year ago.
Management change
An upcoming change in the top management is more exciting news for investors. Roy Gori, who heads the company’s Asian operations, will take over as the chief executive officer after Donald Guloien retires this year. Gori spearheaded Manulife’s expansion in Asia, and his move to the top underscores how crucial the continent has become for the company’s future.
For dividend investors, this all bodes well and presents an opportunity to benefit from the company’s future growth potential and earn regular dividend income. Manulife pays a quarterly dividend of $0.205 per share. Trading at $25.23 a share, the stock offers a dividend yield of 3.25%.
In February, Manulife rewarded its investors with an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend, making 2017 the fourth year in a row that the company raised its payout.
Despite these positive developments, the insurance business may still not be as exciting as one may feel while investing in technology companies, for example. But Manulife is one solid dividend-paying stock that is poised for growth after its dull performance over the past decade.

Manulife Financial Corp. Is a Buy Regardless of What Happens With John Hancock

Joey Frenette | July 17, 2017 | More on:  MFC MFC








 




Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) is a great business with promising growth prospects. It’s a smart buy for investors looking to benefit from the trend of rising interest rates.

It’s been reported that the management team is interested in either spinning off its U.S. segment, John Hancock, or creating an IPO of its own.

As fellow Fool contributor Will Ashworth pointed out, there has been a huge wave of layoffs in the financial services industry of late. Although John Hancock provides a way for Canadian investors to get a strong U.S. presence, this business isn’t where Manulife’s true growth potential lies. Many…

Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) is a great business with promising growth prospects. It’s a smart buy for investors looking to benefit from the trend of rising interest rates.
It’s been reported that the management team is interested in either spinning off its U.S. segment, John Hancock, or creating an IPO of its own.
As fellow Fool contributor Will Ashworth pointed out, there has been a huge wave of layoffs in the financial services industry of late. Although John Hancock provides a way for Canadian investors to get a strong U.S. presence, this business isn’t where Manulife’s true growth potential lies. Many investors want Manulife to get rid of it to potentially boost long-term returns.
Full speed ahead with the Asian business
The management team has its targets set on Asia, where about US$30 trillion worth of wealth will be passed down to the next generation, according to pundits. Manulife has made the right moves to get a front-row seat to this explosive growth with its exclusive deals made with Asian banks.
Manulife made two partnerships with firms based in Hong Kong and Singapore. These partnerships will allow Manulife to get exclusive access to the clientele, so that means Manulife’s products are going to be pushed without having to worry about alternative recommendations.
Manulife’s Asian business accounted for $408 million to core earnings, which was up about 10% from the previous quarter. Manulife has some very strong momentum coming from Asia.
Going forward, we can expect even more contributions from the Asian business, as the management team looks to get more exclusive partnerships done with other banks across Asia.
John Hancock sale in the cards?
Many shareholders want Manulife to simply sell John Hancock rather than to spin it off or start an IPO. The stock of Manulife has still yet to recover from the plunge which happened during the Great Recession, and many investors are starting to become impatient. They want better returns, and John Hancock hasn’t been a bright spot of late; many pundits consider it to be a low-return asset.
I think John Hancock is set to ride some major tailwinds over the next few years once Trump’s agenda come to fruition. Although Canada and Asia are two higher-margin areas to growth, I don’t think it’s a good time to be selling John Hancock now because the low-interest rate environment is soon going to be in the rear-view mirror, and the business is well positioned to thrive over the next few years.
Bottom line
Shareholders just want better results, and John Hancock hasn’t been delivering of late. The Asian and Canadian businesses look far more promising, but I’m not so sure a sale, spin off, or IPO of John Hancock would be the best move over the long term.
Regardless of what happens, Manulife is a terrific buy at current levels. It has great growth prospects in Asia and is set to ride major tailwinds in its John Hancock business if the company decides to keep things as is.
If a spin off, sale, or IPO happens, Manulife’s stock will rally over the short term since this is what shareholders want. It’s a win-win situation at this point for long-term shareholders.
Stay smart. Stay hungry. Stay Foolish.

Portfolio Review: Q2 2017 Stability Amid Adventures | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Portfolio Review: Q2 2017 Stability Amid AdventuresJul. 14, 2017 11:07 AM ET|| Includes: ATGFF, BCE, COST, ENB, MA, MFC, PKIUF, RIOCF, TRMLFby: InzkeeperInzkeeper Dividend growth investing, portfolio strategySummaryThis quarter has been far more about the purpose of the portfolio and less about building the portfolio.The most significant portfolio action this quarter was donations.The dividend-growth approach of the portfolio has left me free to spend my time being truly useful and having adventures.This quarter has been far more about the purpose of the portfolio and less about building the portfolio. Mid-May the portfolio reached all time highs, but since, the portfolio balance has dropped significantly. Keeping the larger picture in mind has been a very good thing. I have not found this balance frightening and (for better or worse!) have taken very little action. One of my first actions in April was a donation of shares of Parkland Fuel TSX:PKI or (OTCPK:PKIUF) and Manulife Financial (MFC). They were chosen because they had the highest capital gains in the open account and, at the time, both seemed to be topping. The financial contact of one of the charities the funds were donated to mentioned when they informed me the funds were received (around mid-May - these things take time) and that receiving the lump-sum at this time of year was perfect timing for them as they move into their slow summer giving season and the financial crunch begins. As I move towards mostly annual giving, instead of monthly giving for as many charities as I can, being counter-cyclical in my giving helps them as well as me. Since RSP and tax season and muck about with the portfolio anyway, it is a good time for me to make these sort of decisions and watch for trimming opportunities during the "sell in May and go away" season. For Parkland Fuel, donating and thereby trimming the holding has been a good decision, capturing some fantastic gains before a gradual decline, but Manulife has been reaching towards 52-week highs again. I hope you do not understand this as saying that I wish I had not donated the MFC shares, as that is not at all the case. It is just extra nice when it also seems like good timing for a trim. Manulife shares had become 6.44% of my portfolio in March, and with the gains, it seemed like an appropriate time to bring the share countdown to something more reasonable. Manulife has also been a stock on which I have written put options and trimming the holding from substantially out-sized to middle-of-the-pack leaves me the opportunity to write puts on it again, so it was a good choice, all-around.
 I have discussed the benefits of donating shares several times, so I will not go into detail again, but basically one avoids the capital gains tax thereby donating pre-instead of post-tax dollars, meanwhile receiving a regular donation receipt for the market value of the donation at time of donation, and the dividend tax credit for any dividends received during the time the shares were held. A win-win situation. Last year, I donated BCE (NYSE:BCE) shares, and later repurchased them (and a few more), averaging up substantially for future tax considerations. These types of tax avoidance strategies can be very effective, especially when planned and executed over many years. If you have noticed I have not been writing or commenting on SA much, there are only positive reasons. I am very well and have been taking advantage of the opportunity that my restored health and freedom from employment affords to visit family, help out friends, and serve the community. In April, I got to play on a friend's ranch in Eastern Alberta, helping them move back to the original homestead leaving room for the next generation to take over the larger ranch-house. It was a blast-from-the-past being on a working ranch during calving season, as I grew up on a mostly self-sufficient dairy. In May, my siblings and I surprised my mother for her already passed 75th birthday (she was off in Cozumel!) and I had a fabulous few weeks seeing my family in person. We are spread across Canada and spend many hours on the phone, but usually get to visit only once a year. I then spent a week in June volunteering with Mennonite Disaster Service building three houses in the wake of the devastating fire in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The picture shows the burned out trees behind one of the foundation/basements we worked on, but the forests are greening again. Whole neighborhoods were leveled, and houses were going up on only about one-quarter of the empty lots, in my estimation. There are years of rebuilding to go. Our thoughts are with those who are currently fighting fires or evacuated from the BC interior and California and other areas battling wildfires. I love construction work but rarely get the opportunity.
 

 Most recently, I spent ten days working in the kitchen at a kid's summer camp. It was a fabulous adventure in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, getting the opportunity to sample the zipline, climbing walls, archery, splashing in the river in addition to the 12 hour days working in the kitchen! They are still short-handed and I am booked in to volunteer for two more weeks this summer! Though my husband is a tad jealous of my adventures, and I would definitely rather he join me, his temperament and health issues are more suited to quiet weeks at home and the office. Yes, those are ski goggles - very helpful to chop 10 lb or more of onions! 

 After all of this, I have to buckle myself back down into an office chair for a couple weeks before running off to the join the circus (kid's camp) again. I must admit that my comfy office is far less attractive and interesting than it was before. This afternoon will be spent weeding at a friend's garden and I have a wall climbing date with my daughter for tomorrow! I am quite certian I can productively work-avoid the entire summer away! So...how did the portfolio do while I was otherwise occupied? Contributions happened as planned and expected, with 15% extra and totaled 1.24% of the portfolio. Dividends experienced a big boost from the Costco (NASDAQ:COST) special dividend, coming in 27.38% higher than last quarter. This great, but will make next quarter look bad! Without the Costco dividend factored in, the dividends still grew a generous 14.97% as the tax refund gets invested. This a 51.28% increase over Q2 2016. Dividends came in at 0.82% of the portfolio. I target approximately 0.75% per quarter (3% annually) so this quarter was very appropriate.
 Option income was significantly down compared to previous quarters, representing a paltry 0.24% gain for the portfolio. This was not necessarily just because I was distracted and otherwise occupied. The markets seemed less stable this quarter and I was seeing less opportunities in the Canadian stocks on which I often write options. Summer dips may change next quarter's results if I am bold (and paying attention) enough to take advantage of them. Normally, I keep only one contract going at a time on a US company, as I am working on building my USD margin account just with option income, not exchanging any currency and adding cash to that account. The one option I did write, mid-May, was a put option on Enbridge (ENB) for January 2018 for $54 which gives me an ACB of $50.98. Despite the fact that the share price has fallen since writing that, I am still happy with the contract, and will be okay purchasing the shares at that price, or just getting the premium. There is a lot of time between now and then. I have a MasterCard (MA) $110 and an AltaGas TSX:ALA or (OTCPK:ATGFF) $34 both expiring next week July 21st. The MA, which was 'in the money' when I wrote it back in February, will very likely expire worthless. As likely as the MA one is to expire, I am just as likely to get put the ALA shares. With an ACB of $27.70, I will not be too disappointed. This represents a small averaging-up for my current holding. Who knows, if the WGL acquisition starts to look positive and market sentiment on this stock improves, some of the shares I am putting on now might just become the ones I will trim as a donation next spring...meanwhile I'm receiving the nice dividend and corresponding dividend tax credit. The growth portion this quarter was an extremely small capital loss of 0.11%. In all, the total return of the portfolio for Q2 2017, was 0.94%. To keep perspective, that rather pathetic 0.94% is more money than I have ever made from employment, and I remain free to continue my adventures (frugally, of course) and continue as my main purpose to make my husband's sacrificially-earned income the most valuable it can be.
 As I look ahead, there is likely more volatility over the summer. Though most of my holdings are rather typical dividend-growth investments, with a few growth oriented names, there are several holdings that I am more concerned about. For the most part my strategy has been to buy quality companies and just gradually, over time as more funds become available, buy more. A few purchases of more-of-the-same were made and the current portfolio looks like this: 

 As usual, I have looked to see if any of my holdings have issues that seem systemic or insurmountable and are unlikely to provide me my targeted return of about 9% on average per year. There are two that are giving me some concern: RioCan REIT TSX:REI.UN or (OTCPK:RIOCF) and Tourmaline Oil TSX:TOU or (OTCPK:TRMLF). It is tempting to sell these just to have more ready cash to invest for a summer dip, but I have not made that decision yet. RioCan seems to be going nowhere as a company, though they have de-levered somewhat. They have been hurt significantly with the rest of the retail oriented sector. However, despite the share price being down so much, I still have modest gains with the dividend income factored in. With a 5.82% dividend, I have not been in a rush to walk away. Looking at the price chart, that has not been a smart decision. But with the stock perched on its 50-week moving average and hitting 52 week lows, I am not running for the exit here. 

Actually, I am a little tempted to repurchase some of the shares I sold at the end of April, which was a little more than half of my holding. (I used those funds to buy CN Rail (CNI).) 
 Tourmaline was purchased as a shorter-term (year or so) oil trade on the dip in February. It has not worked out and I am down 12%. As it is a very small holding (barely one-quarter of my largest) the dollar value of the loss is not concerning. Eventually I will look for an exit point, especially if another opportunity clamors for the cash. 

With my summer adventures, I am more grateful than ever for the stability of a dividend-growth approach and I expect to spend very little time portfolio gazing over the next few months.

Dividends declared prior to Q2 2006 have been restated on a post-split basis. Note (1): U.S. dividend rates apply to U.S. Registered shareholders and U.S. Ownership Statement holders only. Note (2): Dividend rates quoted are gross dividend rates. Actual dividends paid to holders outside Canada are reduced by the applicable Non-residents withholding tax. Note (3): Dividend rates are converted from Cdn$ using the applicable Bank of Canada noon exchange rate on the 24th (or next business day) of the month in which the record date occurs. Prior to Q1 2001, the date used for the Bank of Canada noon exchange rate varied slightly.

Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) is Canada’s largest insurance provider with an international twist. The management team is always on the hunt for opportunities to expand outside Canadian borders, and if you find that your portfolio isn’t as internationally diversified as you’d like, then there’s a strong case for you to pick up shares of Manulife today.
Strong U.S. business 
Manulife currently provides insurance products as well as wealth management services in over approximately 22 countries. Manulife’s U.S. business, under the John Hancock brand, stands to realize significant tailwinds over the medium to long term thanks to a strengthening U.S. economy under the pro-business Trump administration. I believe the U.S. economy is set to take off, and interest rates may rise at a faster rate than originally anticipated.
This is great news for life insurance companies like Manulife, and it appears that the company is very well positioned to profit from a surge in consumer spending. Many American consumers who haven’t increased their insurance coverage since the Financial Crisis may be starting to return over the next few years, and this could send Manulife shares substantially higher.
Asian expansion opens doors to explosive growth
In addition to the impressive U.S. business, the management team has set its sights on the Asian insurance market, which many pundits believe is a gold mine. Fellow Fool contributor Demetris Afxentiou is a fan of Manulife’s Asian growth prospects. He stated that experts are speculating that over US$30 trillion worth of wealth will be passed down to the next generation in Asia. Manulife has a front-row seat to this explosive growth potential since approximately half of Manulife’s insurance sales come from Asia.
Going forward, we can expect Manulife to continue making new deals with Asian banks, which will allow Manulife to sell exclusive products to its existing customers. These exclusive long-term contracts will allow Manulife to obtain next-level growth that wouldn’t be possible if the company had decided to stay confined to Canada.
What about value?
Manulife currently trades at a 15.62 price-to-earnings multiple, which I believe is incredibly cheap when you consider the long-term catalysts that could propel the stock higher.
The stock currently offers investors a bountiful 3.4% dividend yield, which is considerably higher than the company’s five-year historical average yield of 3%. Given the tailwinds the company is likely to enjoy, it’s possible that this dividend will be raised by a substantial amount over the next few years.
If you’re a deep-value investor with a time horizon of five years or more, then look no further than Manulife. The valuation is attractive, and the catalysts could make the stock a huge winner over the next five years.

Breakthrough IPO Receives Rare Endorsement

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Having to buy life insurance is a necessity for almost everybody, so they can protect their loved ones of the financial consequences of death. Shopping life insurance can be boring, but life insurance companies’ stocks are not. Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC)(NYSE:MFC) and Sun Life Financial Inc.  (TSX:SLF)(NYSE:SLF) are two of the biggest life insurers in Canada. If you are looking to add a stock in the insurance sector to your portfolio, which stock should get your attention? Let’s compare these two insurance giants to see which one stands out.
Manulife Financial Corp.
Manulife is Canada’s biggest life insurer. It provides individual life insurance as well as individual and group long-term care insurance services. The company reported a very strong first quarter. Indeed, its return on equity reached 13.7%, while it was 10.8% during the previous quarter. This is due to strong sales in its Asian wealth and asset management business and expected profit from in-force policies. Manulife has improved its product mix, including increased sales of mutual funds. This is beneficial for the firm since mutual funds are high-margin products.
Net income rose to $1.35 billion — up 29% from the year before — while assets under management (AUM) rose to over $1 trillion for the first time in the company’s history. The firm recorded insurance sales of $1.3 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 39% compared with the same quarter last year.
Manulife’s stock is cheap with a P/E one-year forward of 10.39. Its forward P/E-to-growth (PEG) of 0.84 means you are getting growth for a low price.
Sun Life Financial Inc.
Sun Life provides diversified financial services. It offers savings, life and health insurance, as well as retirement and pension products to individuals and groups. The company reported relatively weak first-quarter results. Return on equity was 11% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 11.5% for the same period a year earlier. Lower results came in part from weak growth in its U.S. business and trends in net outflows for its MFS asset management business.
Sun Life has announced a first-quarter net income of $551 million — up 2% from the same quarter last year. The insurance company achieved strong growth with a 58% increase in insurance sales and a 13% increase in wealth sales compared to the same period last year. AUM grew to $927 billion — up 7.8%.
Sun Life’s stock has a one-year forward P/E of 11.56. However, the forward PEG is 1.65. A PEG higher than one means that you are paying too much for growth, so Sun Life’s stock is not as cheap as it looks.
On June 7, Sun Life’s shares soared 3.6% to $45.42 at the close — the biggest rise in six months. The gains followed reports that AUM at MFS rose by 4.2% in the first two months of the second quarter, outpacing the gain in the S&P 500. The company may have halted recent outflows from its large U.S. asset-management division, winning plaudits from analysts.
After all that has been said, it’s not very clear which insurance company is a better buy. However, I think that Manulife’s stock is undervalued and could surprise positively in the future, so I would choose this stock over Sun Life these days.


5 stocks we like better than Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc.
When investing Guru Iain Butler and his shrewd team of analysts have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they began just three years ago, Stock Advisor Canada, is already beating the market by 9.6%. And their Canadian picks have literally doubled the market.
Iain and his team just revealed what they believe are the five best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Manulife Financial Corp. and Sun Life Financial Inc. weren't one of them! That's right - they think these five stocks are even better buys.

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.

History[edit]
Manulife was incorporated as "The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company" by Act of Parliament on 23 June 1887 and was headed by Canada's prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Ontario's lieutenant-governor, Sir Alexander Campbell (there were no conflict-of-interest guidelines at the time and it was not unusual for public persons to be involved in private industry). The idea for the company came from J.B. Carlile, who came to Canada as an agent for the North American Life Assurance Company. It was his first-hand experience on which the new company's product portfolio was based.[5]
Private stock company[edit]
The firm was founded as The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company in 1887. Its first president was Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. The company sold its first policy outside of Canada in Bermuda in 1893. In 1894, policies were sold in Grenada, Jamaica and Barbados; Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti in 1895; and British Honduras, British Guiana, China and Hong Kong in 1897.[6][7]
In 1901, Manulife amalgamated with the Temperance and General Life Assurance Company,[5] a Toronto-based Canadian life insurer that provided preferred rates to abstainers of alcohol. Manulife continued to offer abstainers rates into the 1920s.[7]
In 1931, it opened its first southern China branch in British Hong Kong. Shortly thereafter, it established itself as a leading life insurer in the region with branches in Macau, Swatow and Amoy.[8]
Mutual company[edit]
In 1958, shareholders voted to change its legal form from a joint stock company to a mutual organization, making the company privately owned by its policyholders.[9][10]
In 1984, Manulife announced that it had acquired Waterloo, Ontario-based Dominion Life Assurance Company: a deal that included the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of the company from Lincoln National.[11][12] Dominion Life was founded in Waterloo in 1889, and Manulife made a commitment to the community to retain a significant presence in Waterloo. In 1988, Manulife opened a new five-storey office building at 500 King St. North in Waterloo to house its Canadian Division.[13]
In 1996, the company entered an agreement with Sinochem to form Shanghai-based Zhong Hong Life Insurance Co. Ltd., China’s first joint venture life insurance company, and was granted a license that made it the second foreign insurer[14] to be allowed re-entry into China.[15]
Demutualization and public company[edit]
In 1999, its voting eligible policyholders approved demutualization, and the shares of Manulife, the holding company of The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, began trading on The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) under the ticker 'MFC', and on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) under the ticker ‘945’.[16]
In 2002, Manulife–Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was granted approval by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) to open a branch office in Guangzhou, China, the first branch license granted to a foreign invested joint–venture life insurance company. In 2003, Manulife-Sinochem received approval for a branch office in Beijing, the first multiple-branch license granted to a foreign-invested joint venture life insurance company. The firm is now licensed to operate in more than 50 Chinese cities.[16]
In 2003, Manulife and John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (including its Canadian subsidiary Maritime Life) announced a tax–free stock–for–stock merger of the companies, creating a global insurance franchise. Completed in April 2004, the merger created the largest life insurer in Canada, second largest in North America, and fifth largest in the world at the time.[16]
In 2013 Richard DeWolfe became the Chair of the company’s board,[17] succeeding Gail Cook-Bennett, who retired after serving 34 years on the board.[18] In 2009, Donald Guloien, the Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Dominic D’Alessandro as President and CEO of the company. Shortly before his departure, D’Alessandro modified his retirement package; the restricted units would only vest for a total of $10 million if the shares reached $36 by the end of 2011, and he would receive $5 million if the shares hit $30. This was in response to shareholders’ reaction to the first quarterly loss ever posted by the firm in its public history. Under Guloien's leadership, the first initiatives were a dividend cut and an equity offering to bolster Manulife's capital levels, making it difficult for the share price to reach the target levels needed to vest.[19]
In September 2009, the company purchased AIC’s Canadian retail investment fund business.[20] In October 2009, it purchased Pottruff & Smith Travel Insurance Brokers Inc., a Canadian broker and third party administrator of travel insurance.[21]
In 2010, the company announced that it had purchased Fortis Bank SA/NV’s1 49 per cent ownership in ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management Co. Ltd. The new joint venture, Manulife TEDA Fund Management Company Ltd. (Manulife TEDA), provides traditional retail and institutional asset management for clients in China. The other 51 per cent is owned by Northern International Trust, part of Tianjin TEDA Investment Holding Co., Ltd. (TEDA).[22]
In June 2012, the company opened Manulife Cambodia, with headquarters in Phnom Penh.[23][24]
In September 2014, Manulife agreed to acquire the Canadian operations of Standard Life for a fee of around $3.7 billion.[25]
In 2014, Manulife Financial simplified its logo and brand to refer to itself only as Manulife outside of the United States.[26]
In April 2015, the company announced a partnership with DBS Bank, providing Manulife exclusive access to DBS customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia in exchange for an initial payment of $1.2 billion USD.[27]
In June 2015, Manulife-Sinochem became the first foreign invested joint-venture life insurance company in China authorized to sell mutual funds.[28]
The company has recently revived discussions of listing a real estate investment trust (REIT) backed by its US office property portfolio on the Singapore Exchange. There were discussions to have the IPO last summer, however the economic climate was lacking for REITs.[29]
In 2016, Manulife became the first Canadian insurance company to offer life insurance to people who are HIV-positive, insuring people who have tested HIV-positive, who are between the ages of 30 and 65, and meet certain other criteria for life insurance policies that would pay up to $2 million upon death.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
