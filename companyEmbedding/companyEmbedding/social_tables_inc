You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

One Tabler wins the ultimate award, a golden chiavari, because he/she embodies what it means to be a Tabler. We had this event last year at Studio Theater and we went to Vegas Lounge afterwards to celebrate.The Daybreaker: This was a 7am rave held in our office the day of our day long education event. I didn't think it was possible to bring a DJ in, black out the windows, and cover the room in glow sticks.. but we did, and it was a completely new experience for me. DJ Pelonkey was incredible and seeing other Tablers break out in amazing dance moves was very unexpected and very entertaining. It was a great way to kick off a full day of learning.Our Series B Closing Dinner: We had to set our own tables at The Watergate! I loved it. We walked into a room with rounds that needed to be set with linens, china, and chairs. We were assigned tables and we competed to see who could get it done first. Once again, this is an experience I would never have if I didn't work at Social Tables. We got to see first hand how our software helps event crews set up and break down events.These three stick out for me. I've been with the company for 1.5 years and I am happy I made the choice to come here.--Growth--I've grown so much since I started. I've challenged myself in terms of what I am capable of and taking responsibility for getting things done. I know I am accountable because of the responsibility I am given everyday to make sure things work. This company gives opportunity but it is up to you to make something of it.ConsIt's a very fast paced company and it can be hard to absorb everything coming at you. If you are willing to put in the hours, you will see the rewards. Self starters will flourish here but people who need their hands held will not do as well.Advice to ManagementGive the CEO and Exec team more time to interface with the company. Roll your desks over to new parts of the office and say hello more often.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Social Tables Response Mar 7, 2017 – VP of People Operations Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed review.

This is a place that you are surrounded by good leaders and can offer feedback comfortably and see results. The CEO demands a lot of his employees which is necessary in a high growth company. In return, the CEO provides excellent shareholder value (stock is something every employee gets) and shares success with all leaders, managers, and ICs.ConsThis is a Pro and a Con - ST is still a startup and is ready to launch on its rocketship. Working here requires an entrepreneurial mindset and if you don't have that, it's not for you.Advice to ManagementTrain yourselves and find mentors to help you grow rather than relying on just internal resources.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Social Tables Response Jun 13, 2017 – HR Generalist Hi Tabler - I appreciate you taking the time to give us a review!

Hospitality is a super interesting industry, and there's a lot of opportunity to innovate. One major plus is you're given plenty of room to do your job the way that works best for you, and you're encouraged to and supported in creating new opportunities. Culture is really a company focus which is rare for a startup and pretty sweet. There's also an education budget to foster individual growth, and great digs in a central location right in DC.ConsChange is a challenge, because it happens a lot. The same freedom that's a pro is also a con because it means you can sometimes end up taking care of things yourself you'd rather not do/don't really have time for. These are pretty standard cons of any startup, so nothing unique to Social Tables.Advice to ManagementKeep doing a good job listening to employee feedback.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Social Tables Response Jun 6, 2017 – HR Generalist Hello Tabler and thanks for leaving us a review!

Most of the execs that actually had any successful tech business background have since left, largely due to frustration or inability to work constructively with the CEO, leaving a current leadership in place that really is generally quite inexperienced at leading a tech company. There is a lack of ability or willingness to develop a plan and execute it without jerking it (and the team) around before allowing it to have any chance of being successful. While this type of "change" is touted as a positive, it is actually counter-productive to the team and the business. A little bit a longer-term view is needed, and less hyper-reaction based on immediate results and emotion.The CEO is the core of the problems at ST, as he is so focused on crafting his personal image, driven by a desire to be viewed as a visionary in the tech/start-up arena, while lacking real leadership qualities, or practical experience to apply as the CEO of a company at this stage. He relies too much on his close, long-term allies that feed his ego, and support his erratic behavior to the detriment of the company. While an earlier-stage start-up may survive that, ST is now beyond that point and needs real leadership at the helm.Advice to ManagementFocus more on better blocking and tackling, less about the personal image of the CEO/perception of the company to the outside world, less about the facade, and more about the actual foundation of a successful business - then the rest will follow. This likely requires new leadership with real experience. Without it, ST will likely be another name on the list of D.C. Tech companies that had a good, but short run.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Social Tables Response Jun 6, 2017 – HR Generalist Hi former Tabler - thanks for your thoughtful feedback.

The selection of items and colors is amazing. We love the ability that we have to add venues to the database and store them for future use.What do you dislike?I dislike how difficult it is to place items. The system will auto place an item and you can't over ride it. It would be much easier to use if there were a button that allowed you to override the systems placement of an item. Recommendations to others considering the productPlay around with it as much as you can. The more you use it, the more tools you discover the easier it is to use and the more likely that it will be a staple in your company.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Our entire business relies on this software. We are an event planning company that can work from 30-80 events a week. We use this for each and every event to make sure that all details are included and that our team is set up for complete success.Read MoreShare on10 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as Social TablesReport a ConcernChelsea V.Review SourceChelsea V.Validated ReviewReview SourceGreat for Wedding PlannersUpdated On July 11, 2016Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?That we can easily create layouts for all of our clients that are fully to scale and include objects commonly used in weddings. Even if the venue isn't in the database, you can upload a .jpg of the layout and scale it directly within their software. What do you dislike?That there is a monthly fee for using the software. Recommendations to others considering the productThis is great if you are going to have a lot of events within each month to justify the monthly fee. They have excellent customer service who even recommended to us that in the off-season we could close our account to save money and re-activate when wedding season started again. What business problems are you solving with the product?

The tutorial they have to help you learn how to use it is great and explains everything or you can sign up for a live tutorial and have a real personal teach you how to use the program. The staff are amazingly responsive - even on holidays - and call/email back with answers to questions within 24 hours. My personal rep is named Amanda and she is amazing to work with. Calm, cool and collected. She makes it feel like I am working with my best friend. Great staff, great product!What do you dislike?At the end of the year in 2015 social tables transitioned the floor plans to be able to be 3D... while it isn't a "dislike" it was just no warning was given. Everything ended up great and any bump in the road we hit, Amanda has been able to help us through. Also a bonus, while during the transition - Social Tables did not take away our ability to access the 2D floor plans. They will not delete those until the transition is complete and there are no errors. Good Customer Service!Recommendations to others considering the productSign up for the live tutorial. If you have questions, ask them. You get to see the program in action. Very helpful.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?While during the transition from 2D to 3D is when I really noticed how great the staff were at Social Tables. I always knew the product was great but I never had the need to work so closely with my rep before. The transition gave us the opportunity to get to know each other a little better. That was a positive outcome!Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as Social TablesReport a ConcernAgency in Food ProductionReview SourceAgency in Food ProductionValidated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceVery disapointing Customer Journey what a let downUpdated On December  4, 2015Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?I liked the possibilities of where the software might get to one day.  Please note I have tried to reach a mutually amicable solution with Social Tables prior to posting this review.  What do you dislike?3d Rednedring Glitchy on events with more than 30 tables.  Otherwise I wasna big fan and loyal User. Unfortunately. Pricing Plan is all over the shop. Customer Journey for my whole experience over two years seemed disjointed,  I feel that the staff have recently lost sight of the fact real people with real business use their software Some may say I got a result but I subscribed for some time to a 49.00 per month deal initially to try the software little did I know that the set up was wrong and it gave me most of the functionality during this time only to be told I would get a 200% price rise for the same functionality.  49.00 would only now give me room diagramming which is no use on its own. As a small business I would understand a small increase but surely fully loaded package with the price going up per user would make more sence. I would never have started using this software at 149.00 per month. Equally the team seems unempowered to make business...Recommendations to others considering the productConsider other options carefully, they can move the goalposts on you with no notice.a real shame.What business problems are you solving with the product?

It's so amazing to have a software that has our entire building drawn to scale. I'm so old I remember the days at my first job when the catering managers had to use stencils and a pencil to draw diagrams. At another job I used microsoft word and of course it was never to scale so I always had to shift things around the day of and most of the time the rooms were very cramped and looked off balance. It's so great that this also gives you comfy room between tables to people can walk through easily. This program takes the guesswork out of event diagramming. At our incredibly busy wedding venue, it is a life saver. And the guest management tool is the best. Brides don't have to mess with options on theknot.com which aren't to scale. I'm so thrilled we have this! It's very user friendly as well.What do you dislike?Sometimes the guest list gets attached to something else and I'm still learning when it comes to the menus tab. I'm not sure if the directions go over that but I hope it does. I need to send myself a link and try it out myself so I know exactly what the client is looking at. When the lists don't come in right, at least they have a great support team to help.Recommendations to others considering the productIt is worth every penny. Self drawn diagrams not to scale; your just asking for an event to blow up in your face. Every venue in the industry and ever hotel should invest in this software. I would suggest though sending yourself a link and creating a dummy event when training employees on how to use it so you can see exactly what your client sees and put yourself in their shoes.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We are solving the issue of diagramming, plated meals, vegetarians, food allergies, and guest lists. This solves the problem of having diagrams not to scale and saves us countless hours of labor having to adjust room set ups at the last minute. It also streamlines the process for our clients with assigned seating, plated meals, kids, meals, allergies, high chairs, wheelchairs, booster seats, gluten free, etc. It makes us look incredibly prepared in the eyes of our guests because we know exactly who needs special assistance or a special meal.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as Social TablesReport a ConcernConsultant in Events ServicesReview SourceConsultant in Events ServicesValidated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceSocial Tables glitches in software cause massive problems at eventsUpdated On June 23, 2016Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?We first began using Social Tables in 2014. It was an incredibly useful tool for our clients. However, about 6 months ago the platform began to continually crash, with glitches causing major, irreversible errors for our clients and their VIP guests during events. Through my discussions with Social Tables I came to learn that they knew about all of the glitches in their product and failed to warn their paid users about the potential problems. What do you dislike?I have spent an inordinate amount of hours on the phone, email, and chat with Social Tables support. Many of their support agents were less knowledgeable about their product than I was. It took weeks to get calls returned to upper management when I relayed my client's issues and the fact that our contracts were threatened because of Social Table's massive failures in their product (again, that they knew about). Their upper management failed at fulfilling my clients' requests for an explanation. Their only effort was requesting that I participate in the testing of a new product. Over the course of months, I learned that Social Tables is not only a failed software platform, but that Social Tables knows that their software does not work as promised and yet, they feel that they have no duty to their customers to avail them of their products failures. Furthermore, I learned that Social Tables customer support, customer care, and upper management know very little about business. I got...What business problems are you solving with the product?

 About Social Tables         We envision a world where  every face-to-face event  achieves great things.1,171,637,823 Sqft. of Bookable Space230,330,295 Participants Impacted2,028,710 Events PlannedWhen was the last time you smiled at an event? Whether it was because of a story a conference speaker shared; or because someone you love received an award; or because you connected with a colleague who lives in another state-- that moment impacted you forever. It may have changed your outlook on that day, it may have caused you to think differently, and probably impacted your future and the future of those around you.Great things such as accelerating social entrepreneurship around the world. “I want to send a tremendous thank you to you and your team for your help at the Global Good Fund Gala. We literally could not have done registration without you that evening, and you all helped to make it seamless. You all were fabulous, and a huge help.” - Kristen Y. Archer, Bravo!  Great things such as supporting sports fans as they scream their heads off for touchdowns and feel more alive than ever before. “It’s really important to us that the fan experience is great right from the start, and that it isn’t kicked off on a negative tone when fans have to wait 20 minutes just to be checked-in.” - Ilsa Marden, The Baltimore RavensGreat things such as driving innovation and supporting education at universities worldwide. "Our customers like Social Tables so much they don’t want us to touch their diagrams. We give them the bones, they create their vision, and we execute. It’s incredible." Matt Watson, Florida State University’s Oglesby Union  Today, we’re proud to have fueled more than two million events that helped organizers, stakeholders, and participants bring their ideas to life and create new connections. About Social Tables Founded and headquartered in Washington, DC in 2011 by Dan Berger, Social Tables is the award-winning event-management platform with the largest community of hospitality and meeting professionals. Looking back, we’re so grateful DC chose us. As the capital of hospitality, events are a key part of DC’s economy. It’s a major destination for citywide meetings, and world-class restaurants are opening their doors every week. Beyond potential partners for us, including top hotel management groups and a variety of incredible event venues, top tier event planning firms, and many associations, DC is also home to students from world-class universities, and a strong investment community -- all of which have helped us build Social Tables into the company it is today.  From our homebase in the heart of Metro Center, every day we work to make event management easier with cloud-based hospitality software that helps properties and planners collaborate. We’re thrilled to have won many industry awards including “Innovator of the Year” from Catersource and Event Solutions, and “Best Industry Innovation” from ILEA. But even more importantly, we’re thrilled to support planners and properties around the world in achieving their goals. And, we’re not stopping anytime soon. We’re committed to developing new ways to leverage our massive event library using advances in machine learning to fuel growth in the hospitality industry.  We believe meetings and events that strengthen human connection hold more importance than ever before. At a time when we’re distracted by digital devices, facing a barrage of new information competing for our attention, and have introduced technology that removes emotional intelligence from the equation, face-to-face events stand out as a place for genuine connection; a place for collaboration. Together, we will achieve great things. Core Values   It Takes a VillageWe’re creating a lasting community built on teamwork and collaboration.    Be OutrageousHave fun, be weird, always be you.
