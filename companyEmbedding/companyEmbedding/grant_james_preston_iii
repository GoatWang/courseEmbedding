In re James Preston Hess, III

Case No. M2011-01561-COA-R3-CV (TN Ct. App., Jul. 31, 2012)


		  		    This is an appeal from an order appointing a conservator for the adult son of divorced parents. The father contends that the evidence does not support the determinations that the son lacks the capacity to fully attend to his needs without assistance and that the appointment of a conservator is warranted; Mother contends that the father does not have standing to appeal. We affirm the court in all respects.  

Beverly Lynn Cook (“Mother”), the mother of James Preston Hess, IV (“Preston”), filed a petition to have a conservator appointed for Preston. Preston was born with spinal bifida and is wheelchair bound, among other maladies. His parents were divorced when Preston was two; Mother was named primary residential parent and Preston lives with her. At the time this proceeding was initiated, Preston was eighteen years old; he has completed a GED and works at Home Depot.  

Several weeks before the conservatorship petition was filed, Mother filed a petition for civil contempt in the divorce proceeding seeking, inter alia, an order that Preston’s father, James Preston Hess, III, (“Father”) maintain medical and hospitalization insurance and pay support for Preston past the age of majority. The conservatorship proceeding and child support action were consolidated for trial.  

Both matters were referred to the Clerk and Master and on October 1 13, 2010, the Clerk and Master entered an “Order” which held that Preston was disabled and in need of a full conservatorship and appointed Mother as conservator of his person and property. Father filed a motion pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 16-16-201(b)2 requesting that the Chancellor review the order of the Clerk and Master. Upon its review of the record, the Clerk and Master’s order was affirmed. Father then filed a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend, which was likewise denied.
