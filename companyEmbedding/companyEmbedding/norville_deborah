And I buy Deborah Norville a lot.  Her yarn is high quality with lots of selections for any taste.  HOWEVER, this yarn is listed as worsted weight and there is no way this is worsted weight.  it is at best sport.  I just purchased this yarn thinking it was worsted weight and am very disappointed to find out how thin it is. Now I need to figure out what to do with it.Was this a gift?:No(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-4Back to top

"I really like this yarn and colors. I've become known as the hat lady where I work, and get lots of requests for homemade hats, people seem to really like variegated yarns (me, too!). The bulkiness of this yarn makes the knitting project go pretty quickly.

The color in the representative pic, which I now know is "Stormy", looks quite different than the swatch (in which you can clearly see greens and yellows.)  I took a chance that rep pic was twilight blue-which I now know is not variegated."

Publisher's Description▼▲
  Thank You. Can such small words hold life changing power? Yes!  Deborah Norville's groundbreaking and persuasive book argues that gratitude is the secret key to unlocking your full life potential. Rooted in science, presented from a spiritual perspective, Thank You Power details the surprising life improvements that can stem from the practice of gratitude. Norville brings together for the first time the behavioral and psychological research that prove what people of faith have long known: giving thanks brings life blessings. Beginning with those two small words, thank you, Norville shows how you can be happier and more resilient, have better relationships, improved health, and less stress. The list of benefits is long. You'll exercise more, be more creative, bounce back more quickly from adversity, have a higher immune response, live longer, be better liked by others, and have more creativity in solving problems. Each of these outcomes is backed up by published research. The key? Gratitude. Ever heard the one about being able to catch more flies with honey than vinegar? If you want to eliminate many of the negatives of daily stress and better deal with the realities of your day, then read on. Deborah Norville may have found the real secret to happiness. You'll find the answer inside.--Dr. Mehmet Oz, Vice Chairman and Professor of Surgery, Columbia University; and Author, You Series Deborah Norville has proven that resilience is a big part of success. Success is power-and Thank You Power is aptitude and attitude at their most efficient and, therefore, most effective. Deborah has done a wonderful job with a subject that is important for all of us.--Donald J. Trump We've all heard it before-count your blessings, concentrate on the positive, say thank you-but actually putting it in to practice and becoming a more grateful person can be easily pushed aside in this hurried world. Deborah Norville, in her latest book, Thank You Power, clearly lays out easy steps to put you on the path to a more positive lifestyle.--Anthony Robbins, Best-Selling Author, Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power Your mother was right! You should say thank you about almost everything! Why? Because as Deborah Norville's new book proves, being positive and grateful leads to a happier, healthier, more successful life. And by the way, thank you for reading this, and thank you, Deborah, for writing this book.--Joan Rivers, Entertainer What a refreshing, positive read! Thank You Power makes me want to do everything I can to be grateful for not only the big things but also the sometimes hard details of my life. This is a formula that can make the whole world a happier place in which to live!--Harold G. Koenig, MD, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Associate Professor of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center People who never complain, groan, or worry don't need this book. (They do need a lesson on honesty.) The other 99 percent of us will benefit from Deborah's practical and hopeful words. We need this message.--Max Lucado, Pastor, Oak Hills Church; and Best-Selling Author, 3:16

            The Proverbs 17:22 tells us that "A happy heart is like good medicine, but a broken spirit drains your strength."  Author Deborah Norville inadvertently expands on this verse and the many others in Proverbs about the benefits of having a "merry heart".  This book is filled with stirring stories and research indicating how important it is to have a positive attitude and a grateful spirit; according to Norville, it will make us happier, healthier, and and better able to handle life's stressors.  This book is a good reminder to us to have a more positive attitude and to look at the happier side of life.  Dwelling on the negative has no benefit, while dwelling on the positive can add to our healthy and give us prolonged quality of life.Kudos to Norville for this timely reminder that being grateful does not only bless others but benefits us as well.

            Outstanding book. The scientific research by a variety of Universities reveals the creator of all humankind designed us to be thankful people. Easy read, interesting, inspiring. Give it to every skeptic you know.

Early life[edit]
Deborah Norville was born in Dalton, Georgia. Norville won her town’s local Junior Miss contest, a beauty contest for high school senior girls. Her talent was sewing. Norville went on to represent Georgia in the 1976 America’s Junior Miss pageant. She did not win but credits seeing the behind-the-scenes work of the CBS Television production team as inspiring her to switch her career goal from law to television journalism.[2]
Education[edit]
Deborah Norville is a graduate of the University of Georgia. She graduated summa cum laude in three years with a perfect 4.0 grade point average and was named a First Honor Graduate and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism degree. While at the University of Georgia, she served on the Main Court of the University’s Student Judiciary and was a member of Delta Delta Delta Sorority.[1]
Early career[edit]
Deborah Norville began her television career while still a college student. She received an internship through Georgia Public Television, where she worked on The Lawmakers, a nightly program covering the Georgia General Assembly. She was spotted by an executive of WAGA-TV in Atlanta who offered her a summer internship. As Norville recalled, “The third day they were short on reporters and they asked me to cover a news story.” She reported that evening on the six o’clock news and was later offered a weekend reporting position during her senior year in college. In January 1979, she conducted a live interview with President Jimmy Carter.[1]
Norville joined WAGA-TV as a full-time reporter after graduating and was named weekend anchor in October 1979. In 1982, she was hired as a reporter and later anchor by WMAQ-TV, the NBC owned station in Chicago. In 1986, when it was announced Norville would be joining NBC News in New York, Mayor Harold Washington declared “Deborah Norville Week” in Chicago.[3]
NBC News[edit]
Deborah Norville joined NBC News in January 1987 as anchor of NBC News at Sunrise, becoming the only solo female anchor of a network newscast. Ratings on Sunrise jumped 40% when she joined the program, which led to her being asked to occasionally substitute on NBC’s Today Show. In August 1989, a documentary in which Norville was the primary host, Bad Girls, on violent teenaged girls, was the seventh most watched show the week it aired, according to Nielsen ratings.[4]
In September 1989, Norville was named news anchor on Today. Soon after, Today co-host Jane Pauley announced her desire to leave the Today Show, and Norville was named her successor. Pauley went on to host a primetime show, Real Life with Jane Pauley. Norville became co-host of Today in January 1990. During her tenure on Today, she won an Emmy award for her role in NBC’s coverage of the democratic uprising in Romania.[5] Ratings on Today declined after Norville’s arrival. NBC management was accused of mishandling the transition. One insider told People magazine, “NBC handled the whole situation in a very poor manner. I don’t think she (Deborah) blames anyone in particular. I just think she feels the situation was handled unprofessionally – in an undignified manner for both her and Jane.”[6] After Norville took maternity leave on the birth of her first child, she did not return to the program.[7]
ABC Network Radio[edit]
In May 1991, ABC TalkRadio Networks announced Deborah Norville would be hosting a prime time program, broadcast from her homes in New York and Long Island. The Deborah Norville Show: From Her Home to Yours featured newsmaker interviews and listener calls. It ran from September 1991 to October 1992, when Norville joined CBS News to resume her television career.[8]
Return to television[edit]
Deborah Norville returned to television in October 1992, when she joined CBS News as a correspondent. She reported for Street Stories and 48 Hours, for which she won her second Emmy award for coverage of the Mississippi floods of 1994. She was later assigned to the CBS Evening News and named co-anchor with Dana King of America Tonight, a primetime news magazine. From 1993-1995, Norville regularly anchored the CBS Sunday Evening News, which had been vacant since Connie Chung was elevated to co-anchor of the CBS Evening News.
In 1995, Norville was named anchor of Inside Edition, a syndicated newsmagazine, a position she continues to hold. In March 2015, the show celebrated her 20th anniversary on the program, noting that she was now the longest serving female anchor on national television.[9] Among Norville’s reports were her reports from the Davidson County, North Carolina jail, billed as the "toughest in America"; her interview with Paula Jones, whose accusation of sexual harassment by then-President Bill Clinton led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment proceedings; and her series of "jobs", notably the song she wrote and performed, “Keep On Movin.” Set to music written by noted producer Junior Vasquez, Norville wrote the lyrics, a challenge she described in O, The Oprah Magazine. “The strength from meeting that challenge”, she said, “is still with me. It’s the boost you get from accomplishing something you never dreamed you could do”.[10]
In 2003, MSNBC announced Deborah Norville was joining its primetime line up to host a 9pm program.[11] She left Deborah Norville Tonight in 2005, citing the challenge of juggling her Inside Edition and MSNBC duties along with family responsibilities.
In 2015, Knit and Crochet Now!, a craft show seen on public television, announced the appointment of Deborah Norville as host of its upcoming season.[12]
Publishing[edit]
Alongside her television career, Norville has frequently moonlighted as a writer. She served as a contributing editor to Inside Sports magazine in the 1980s and as a contributing editor to McCall’s magazine from 1991 to 1993. She published the New York Times best-seller Thank You Power: Making the Science of Gratitude Work for You (Thomas Nelson, 2007), featuring the benefits found by research on gratitude. This was preceded by Back on Track: How To Straighten Out Your Life When It Throws You a Curve (Simon and Schuster, 1997), which drew on her earlier experiences on the Today Show.
The Power of Respect: Benefit from the Most Forgotten Element of Success (Thomas Nelson, 2009) explains—through scientific evidence—how respect is power in business, at home, and in your personal life. Her history of Inside Edition, The Way We Are: Heroes, Scoundrels, and Oddballs from 25 Years of Inside Edition, written with Charlie Carillo and a foreword by Donald Trump (Inside Edition Books, 2013), details all 8,150 episodes of the show, celebrating its 25th anniversary.
Additionally, she has written several knit and crochet pattern books, most notably Knit With Deborah Norville - 18 Classic Designs For The Whole Family (Leisure Arts, Inc., 2009). She has also written two children's books—I Don't Want to Sleep Tonight (Golden Books, 1999) and I Can Fly (Golden Books, 2001)—and contributed to several editions of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.[13]
Other activities[edit]
In 2008, Norville began performing in infomercials. In addition to commercials for anti-aging cream and lotions, she launched the Deborah Norville Collection of knit and crochet yarns in partnership with Premier Yarns,[14] a North Carolina-based yarn manufacturer. Norville debuted the line at the 2009 Craft Hobby Show, the craft industry’s premier convention, where she also served as the Keynote Speaker.[15] The Norville yarn line and other knit and crochet accessories are available in retail craft stores and online.
Deborah Norville was elected to the Board of Directors of the Viacom Corporation[16] in March 2013. She serves on the company’s compensation committee.
Personal life[edit]
Norville married Swedish businessman Karl Wellner in 1987;[2] the couple have three children, Niki, Kyle, and Mikaela.[17]

In May 1991, ABC TalkRadio Networks announced Deborah Norville would be hosting a prime time program, broadcast from her homes in New York and Long Island. The Deborah Norville Show: From Her Home to Yours featured newsmaker interviews and listener calls. It ran from September 1991 to October 1992, when Norville joined CBS News to resume her television career.[8]
Return to television[edit]
Deborah Norville returned to television in October 1992, when she joined CBS News as a correspondent.

Norville debuted the line at the 2009 Craft Hobby Show, the craft industry’s premier convention, where she also served as the Keynote Speaker.[15] The Norville yarn line and other knit and crochet accessories are available in retail craft stores and online.
Deborah Norville was elected to the Board of Directors of the Viacom Corporation[16] in March 2013. She serves on the company’s compensation committee.
Personal life[edit]
Norville married Swedish businessman Karl Wellner in 1987;[2] the couple have three children, Niki, Kyle, and Mikaela.[17]

Deborah Anne Norville (born August 8, 1958) is an American television journalist and businesswoman. Norville is the anchor of Inside Edition, a syndicated television news magazine, a position she has held since March 1995. She is a member of the Board of Directors of the Viacom Corporation. She markets and sells a line of yarns (Deborah Norville Collection) for knit and crochet enthusiasts, manufactured by Premier Yarns. Previously, she was an anchor and correspondent for CBS News and earlier co-host of Today on NBC. Her book Thank You Power was a New York Times best-seller.[1]

Early life[edit]
Deborah Norville was born in Dalton, Georgia. Norville won her town’s local Junior Miss contest, a beauty contest for high school senior girls. Her talent was sewing. Norville went on to represent Georgia in the 1976 America’s Junior Miss pageant. She did not win but credits seeing the behind-the-scenes work of the CBS Television production team as inspiring her to switch her career goal from law to television journalism.[2]
Education[edit]
Deborah Norville is a graduate of the University of Georgia. She graduated summa cum laude in three years with a perfect 4.0 grade point average and was named a First Honor Graduate and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism degree. While at the University of Georgia, she served on the Main Court of the University’s Student Judiciary and was a member of Delta Delta Delta Sorority.[1]
Early career[edit]
Deborah Norville began her television career while still a college student. She received an internship through Georgia Public Television, where she worked on The Lawmakers, a nightly program covering the Georgia General Assembly. She was spotted by an executive of WAGA-TV in Atlanta who offered her a summer internship. As Norville recalled, “The third day they were short on reporters and they asked me to cover a news story.” She reported that evening on the six o’clock news and was later offered a weekend reporting position during her senior year in college. In January 1979, she conducted a live interview with President Jimmy Carter.[1]
Norville joined WAGA-TV as a full-time reporter after graduating and was named weekend anchor in October 1979. In 1982, she was hired as a reporter and later anchor by WMAQ-TV, the NBC owned station in Chicago. In 1986, when it was announced Norville would be joining NBC News in New York, Mayor Harold Washington declared “Deborah Norville Week” in Chicago.[3]
NBC News[edit]
Deborah Norville joined NBC News in January 1987 as anchor of NBC News at Sunrise, becoming the only solo female anchor of a network newscast. Ratings on Sunrise jumped 40% when she joined the program, which led to her being asked to occasionally substitute on NBC’s Today Show. In August 1989, a documentary in which Norville was the primary host, Bad Girls, on violent teenaged girls, was the seventh most watched show the week it aired, according to Nielsen ratings.[4]
In September 1989, Norville was named news anchor on Today. Soon after, Today co-host Jane Pauley announced her desire to leave the Today Show, and Norville was named her successor. Pauley went on to host a primetime show, Real Life with Jane Pauley. Norville became co-host of Today in January 1990. During her tenure on Today, she won an Emmy award for her role in NBC’s coverage of the democratic uprising in Romania.[5] Ratings on Today declined after Norville’s arrival. NBC management was accused of mishandling the transition. One insider told People magazine, “NBC handled the whole situation in a very poor manner. I don’t think she (Deborah) blames anyone in particular. I just think she feels the situation was handled unprofessionally – in an undignified manner for both her and Jane.”[6] After Norville took maternity leave on the birth of her first child, she did not return to the program.[7]
ABC Network Radio[edit]
In May 1991, ABC TalkRadio Networks announced Deborah Norville would be hosting a prime time program, broadcast from her homes in New York and Long Island. The Deborah Norville Show: From Her Home to Yours featured newsmaker interviews and listener calls. It ran from September 1991 to October 1992, when Norville joined CBS News to resume her television career.[8]
Return to television[edit]
Deborah Norville returned to television in October 1992, when she joined CBS News as a correspondent. She reported for Street Stories and 48 Hours, for which she won her second Emmy award for coverage of the Mississippi floods of 1994. She was later assigned to the CBS Evening News and named co-anchor with Dana King of America Tonight, a primetime news magazine. From 1993-1995, Norville regularly anchored the CBS Sunday Evening News, which had been vacant since Connie Chung was elevated to co-anchor of the CBS Evening News.
In 1995, Norville was named anchor of Inside Edition, a syndicated newsmagazine, a position she continues to hold. In March 2015, the show celebrated her 20th anniversary on the program, noting that she was now the longest serving female anchor on national television.[9] Among Norville’s reports were her reports from the Davidson County, North Carolina jail, billed as the "toughest in America"; her interview with Paula Jones, whose accusation of sexual harassment by then-President Bill Clinton led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment proceedings; and her series of "jobs", notably the song she wrote and performed, “Keep On Movin.” Set to music written by noted producer Junior Vasquez, Norville wrote the lyrics, a challenge she described in O, The Oprah Magazine. “The strength from meeting that challenge”, she said, “is still with me. It’s the boost you get from accomplishing something you never dreamed you could do”.[10]
In 2003, MSNBC announced Deborah Norville was joining its primetime line up to host a 9pm program.[11] She left Deborah Norville Tonight in 2005, citing the challenge of juggling her Inside Edition and MSNBC duties along with family responsibilities.
In 2015, Knit and Crochet Now!, a craft show seen on public television, announced the appointment of Deborah Norville as host of its upcoming season.[12]
Publishing[edit]
Alongside her television career, Norville has frequently moonlighted as a writer. She served as a contributing editor to Inside Sports magazine in the 1980s and as a contributing editor to McCall’s magazine from 1991 to 1993. She published the New York Times best-seller Thank You Power: Making the Science of Gratitude Work for You (Thomas Nelson, 2007), featuring the benefits found by research on gratitude. This was preceded by Back on Track: How To Straighten Out Your Life When It Throws You a Curve (Simon and Schuster, 1997), which drew on her earlier experiences on the Today Show.
The Power of Respect: Benefit from the Most Forgotten Element of Success (Thomas Nelson, 2009) explains—through scientific evidence—how respect is power in business, at home, and in your personal life. Her history of Inside Edition, The Way We Are: Heroes, Scoundrels, and Oddballs from 25 Years of Inside Edition, written with Charlie Carillo and a foreword by Donald Trump (Inside Edition Books, 2013), details all 8,150 episodes of the show, celebrating its 25th anniversary.
Additionally, she has written several knit and crochet pattern books, most notably Knit With Deborah Norville - 18 Classic Designs For The Whole Family (Leisure Arts, Inc., 2009). She has also written two children's books—I Don't Want to Sleep Tonight (Golden Books, 1999) and I Can Fly (Golden Books, 2001)—and contributed to several editions of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.[13]
Other activities[edit]
In 2008, Norville began performing in infomercials. In addition to commercials for anti-aging cream and lotions, she launched the Deborah Norville Collection of knit and crochet yarns in partnership with Premier Yarns,[14] a North Carolina-based yarn manufacturer. Norville debuted the line at the 2009 Craft Hobby Show, the craft industry’s premier convention, where she also served as the Keynote Speaker.[15] The Norville yarn line and other knit and crochet accessories are available in retail craft stores and online.
Deborah Norville was elected to the Board of Directors of the Viacom Corporation[16] in March 2013. She serves on the company’s compensation committee.
Personal life[edit]
Norville married Swedish businessman Karl Wellner in 1987;[2] the couple have three children, Niki, Kyle, and Mikaela.[17]

Mini Bio (1)


          Deborah Norville is a two-time national Emmy winner and mother of three (sons Niki and Kyle, and daughter Mikaela), who currently anchors the nationally syndicated show, Inside Edition (1988). She previously worked as a correspondent for Street Stories (1992), 48 Hours (1988), and served as co-anchor for America Tonight (1994) and Today (1952). At Today (1952), Norville, a former Georgia beauty queen, replaced longtime co-host Jane Pauley, creating a storm of controversy and a slew of unflattering press clips on the merits of brains vs beauty and the horrors of ageism at TV news divisions. Her tumultuous stay at NBC led her to write the book, "Back on Track: How to Straighten Out Your Life When it Throws You a Curve" (Simon & Schuster, 1997). She has also written two children's books, "I Don't Want to Sleep Tonight" (Golden Books, 1999) and "I Can Fly" (Golden Books, 2001). She is a First Honor Graduate, Summa Cum Laude, of the University of Georgia.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
