 Obama Nominates Wife of Wall Street Donor Linked to Bailout Controversy as Ambassador to France 



    Get your ambassadorship to a major European country for 50% off.  

    June 8, 2014  

Daniel Greenfield 

   




 Are you a titan of finance? Do you bundle huge contributions for Obama? Just wait till you hear the news. There's a big sale on. Prices are being slashed. Get your ambassadorship to a major European country for 50% off. Ralph L. Schlosstein and Jane D. Hartley are ugly examples of how the left's crony capitalist infrastructure works. Both husband and wife were in the Carter Administration. Hartley, who is Obama's nominee for Ambassador to France, went on to lucrative media and consulting gigs, but her husband was the one who really monetized his experience. From 1977 to 1981, he worked in the Carter administration, first as deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department (the aforementioned Mr. Altman), where he was responsible for administering the New York City loan program and for advising the Treasury Secretary on municipal finance issues, and later as Associate Director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff, where he was responsible for advising the President on urban policy, economic development and housing issues. At Shearson Lehman in the 80s, Schlosstein, among other jobs, was head of the mortgage and savings institutions group... It was a time of great innovation in investible mortgage products. Mr. Schlosstein started the firm's interest rate swap business and led its Mortgage and Savings Institutions Group. Schlosstein then went on to co-found BlackRock which got a sweet deal from the bailout. Mr. Geithner has also faced scrutiny over how well taxpayers were served by his handling of another aspect of the bailout: three no-bid contracts the New York Fed awarded to BlackRock, a money management firm, to oversee troubled assets acquired by the bank. BlackRock was well known to the Fed. Mr. Geithner socialized with Ralph L. Schlosstein, who founded the company and remains a large shareholder, and has dined at his Manhattan home. Mr. Schlosstein said that while he and Mr. Geithner spoke frequently, BlackRock’s work for the Fed never came up. 




 


  After BlockRock, Schlosstein became President and CEO of Evercore which had handled the GM bailout and made big bucks doing it. Evercore Partners, for instance, was enlisted by the government to find a buyer for GM. The only “buyer” they found was the American taxpayer. But despite this failing, Evercore, after its healthy fee of $46 million, was able to secure an additional $17.9 million for a “success fee.” The CEO of Evercore was able to return the favor (to the administration, not the taxpayers) by raising $2.1 million at a gala dinner at his home for the president’s re-election campaign. And now Schlosstein's better half gets to be the Ambassador to France. Why not? This is an administration for sale. President Obama on Friday nominated Jane D. Hartley, the chief executive officer of an economic consulting firm, to be ambassador to France, once more propelling a campaign fund-raiser into a prominent diplomatic position. The Center for Responsive Politics listed her as a “bundler” who raised more than $519,000 for Mr. Obama’s re-election effort. Her husband, Ralph L. Schlosstein, is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party. At least her ambassadorship will probably be cheaper than the Wall Street and GM bailouts. And, unlike another Obama and Hillary donor who got to play Euro ambassador, she's not a pedophile. It's a small victory, but with an administration this horrifyingly corrupt, the American people have to set the bar really low.

PE Firms Help Schlosstein Launch HighView


September 9, 2008
By PEHub Administrator






HighView Investment Group has launched as an asset management firm that will acquire minority interests in independent alternative asset managers. Its initial capitalization is more than $600 million, including commitments from Evercore Partners, Stone Point Capital and HighView CEO Ralph Schlosstein (co-founder and former president of BlackRock). Read more…
 
PRESS RELEASE
Evercore Partners Inc. (NYSE: EVR) announced today that it will be a founding member of an investor group that includes BlackRock Co-Founder and former President Ralph Schlosstein and Stone Point Capital, among others, in launching HighView Investment Group. HighView’s initial capital commitments exceed $600 million, including $50 million from Mr. Schlosstein and $150 million from Evercore, and will provide the initial funding for what is expected to be a significantly larger company. HighView, led by Mr. Schlosstein, is an asset management firm that will seek to acquire minority interests in independent alternative asset managers with more than $2 billion in assets under management across a broad range of geographies and products, including hedge funds, private equity, distressed debt, real estate, high-performance equity and fund-of-funds. 





“As we have often said, our top strategic objective is to better balance Evercore between its advising and investing activities. HighView is a very attractive step in this direction,” said Roger C. Altman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Evercore Partners. “Through this relationship, we will have the opportunity to invest in alternative investment managers through a scaled and diversified platform, and to partner with world-class management talent. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investment group’s relationship network and the synergistic deal flow between HighView and Evercore.”
“On a personal note, I am also extremely pleased to be investing again with Ralph, whom I have known well for 30 years,” said Mr. Altman. “I worked with Ralph at Lehman Brothers and first partnered with him when Larry Fink and he founded BlackRock in 1988 — an investment that still ranks as one of the best with which I have ever been involved. I know first-hand of Ralph’s ability to create and grow a highly successful investment management firm, and I am looking forward to the future success of HighView.”
Evercore expects to be an important partner in the founding and ongoing management of HighView, providing financial advisory services, infrastructure support and other investment banking services. Mr. Altman will also join HighView’s Board of Directors. 





“Evercore is a world-class firm and I welcome its involvement in the founding group of investors backing the launch of HighView,” said Mr. Schlosstein, Chief Executive Officer of HighView. “Roger and I have achieved great success together both at Lehman Brothers and at BlackRock. I value enormously his counsel and welcome the active involvement in HighView’s business of Evercore’s extremely talented professional team. I also am excited about the opportunities that HighView will have in executing its business plan and growing its franchise.”
Evercore’s commitment of $150 million is expected to be drawn down over a period of four to five years. Evercore will fund its commitment from its existing cash resources. Evercore views its capital commitment to HighView as an important part of its continuing effort to strengthen and grow its Investment Management business. Evercore expects its capital contributions to be modestly dilutive to its earnings in 2009 and accretive in subsequent years starting in 2010. Evercore’s investment in HighView will be subject to significant liquidity restrictions.

A whole new game: Face to face with Evercore's Ralph Schlosstein - Pensions & Investments

























































































































































































A whole new game: Face to face with Evercore’s Ralph Schlosstein
 


CEO is blazing a far different path with Evercore Partners from the trail he followed while building BlackRock



      By Douglas Appell
 · May 17, 2010



Ralph Schlosstein was on the rebound when he joined Evercore Partners Inc. as president and CEO in May 2009, with a mission to build that publicly listed investment bank's money management business. Alternatives holding company HighView Investment Group, the executive's first move after leaving his perch as co-founder and president of BlackRock (BLK) Inc. (BLK) in early 2008, was undercut by the market's implosion later that year.Mr. Schlosstein ultimately decided to return the $600 million he had raised from investors just ahead of Lehman Brothers Holdings' confidence-crushing bankruptcy. But the closure of HighView's door immediately saw others open for Mr. Schlosstein. The industry veteran said he left a “phenomenal run” at BlackRock, where he helped oversee the acquisitions of State Street Research & Management, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and Quellos Group LLC, in search of new challenges.The game plan for Evercore's money management growth bears little resemblance to BlackRock's successful strategy, which melded a series of hefty money management acquisitions into a “One BlackRock” organization. Instead, Evercore, as a holding company, will take minority stakes in partner firms. Its first two big investments under Mr. Schlosstein — in private equity firm Trilantic Capital Partners and equity manager Atalanta Sosnoff Capital LLC — were announced in the first quarter.

What does a guy who helped build BlackRock do for a second act? I had a phenomenal run at Blackrock. Larry (Fink) and I are still extremely close — there's never been a moment in the 20 years (I was No. 2 at BlackRock) that I said "I wish he weren't here, and that I had his job." So, it was about another challenge. I really do enjoy building businesses — entrepreneurial businesses.  Will the environment favoring an advisory firm with a money management arm go in and out of favor? Here's what I think will happen in the securities and banking industry. There'll be 10 to 12 really big firms — financial supermarkets — with huge amounts of capital, competing on the basis of that capital, (as well as) a bunch of small investment banking boutiques. And then there'll be room for two or three firms in the middle. One of them is there already: Lazard — a bigger, more global version of Evercore. We are, I believe, the firm that has the best chance to be the second of those firms, with a very strong money management business, a very strong global advisory business and an institutional equities business to raise capital for our clients. No proprietary trading — steering clear of the inevitable conflicts in having a lot of capital to invest on your own behalf, (while) being an agent and adviser for your clients. Does that midtier status imply a limit on Evercore's growth? I think there's a limit to how much advisory business you can do without a balance sheet. Money management is probably the one area where we're not particularly constrained, because we're a peanut and it's a massive business. The challenge there is finding the right kind of businesses.  In Evercore's latest results, money management remained a cost center. (For now, it's) a $5 billion collection of early-stage businesses that I inherited, all of which are doing pretty well. We're starting to add to that through acquisitions, but we have very tough standards for what we're interesting in buying — very high-quality, (repeatable) institutional investment processes; people who fit well with our partnership-type culture. And we're a holding company, so we're going to own pieces of businesses, and a requirement for us is that the management of (any firm we buy into), including the portfolio managers, own a significant piece of equity in these firms as well, to ensure an alignment of interests. So the two (first-quarter) transactions we did — Atalanta Sosnoff, we bought 49%. The other transaction we did, Trilantic, we own a much smaller portion (because) I believe in private equity, if an institution owns more than 10% to 15% of the top line of the business, you ultimately run the risk of it being destabilized. What do you and Evercore bring to the table for money management affiliates? First, we can provide a balance sheet that helps with transitions in ownership; second, we have relationships that can be helpful in capital-raising for certain types of businesses; third, we happen to be led by an executive who has some modicum of experience in the money management business ... Yourself? Yes ... look, the truth is, if you're selling your business outright you care a little bit less about who your partner is. If you co-own your business, you care a lot about the culture, ethics and reputation of the firm, and the knowledge base of the senior executives. So I think having a great brand, which Evercore does have, and a CEO who's quite knowledgeable about the money management business and has dealt with almost any issue that these people confront in the evolution of their businesses, make us a really good partner to high-quality firms.  Which will remain independent? It's not inconceivable that at some point two of them might conclude, it makes sense for us to join together (for the) economies of scale. But the basic premise we start with is: We'll give you lots of help and coaching, but at the end of the day we're looking for you to take the lead in continuing to grow the value of the equity we own together. We're more in the (Legg Mason (LM), Affiliated Managers Group, BNY Mellon Asset Management) model than in the BlackRock model, which you can only do with scale. We obviously don't have that. We're smaller. If you're not scale, you have to pick the holding company model. You could eventually achieve scale. Yeah, but when you enter into a partnership with a bunch of people, you really can't go back to them afterward and say, "Remember what I told you in 2010? In 2018, we're going to merge all these things together." That's not a way one builds a reputation for being a great place to partner with.  Is your approach to building the business more strategic or opportunistic? We have a very clear strategy, but the execution is by definition opportunistic. I get asked all the time: How big is your money management business going to be? We would be foolish to set any kind of goal. When we can find great businesses, with great people, great cultures that want to affiliate with us, we should try to do every one of those we can. If four of them come along in one quarter, we should do them. If none come along for two years, we should sit on the sidelines. Your rough preferences? Institutional, higher value-added products ... so equities, and further out from equities to whatever is the higher-return, higher-volatility type of businesses. Distressed real estate, private equity, long-short equity. I think those are the growth parts of the money management business. I think the active equities business will become more focused on strategies designed to produce not 50 to 75 basis points of excess return, but a couple of hundred points. If your friend Mr. Fink is right in saying institutional clients will increasingly opt to deal with a smaller number of big money managers, capable of offering a full suite of coordinated strategies, are you on the right path? I don't disagree with that. More large investors today are asking ... “What should I do with my money.” That's a growing — but still a relatively small — segment of the institutional marketplace. ... There's still a lot of room in the business (for smaller firms).
