Dental Services Deal Marks Huron’s Second in Dental Industry in Nine Months
August 5,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”), one of the nation’s leading middle market private equity firms, today announced the first in a series of planned investments in the dental services industry with an investment in Dynamic Dental Partners (“DDP”).  Based in Sarasota, Fla., DDP is a leading dental services organization (“DSO”) that provides operational support to a network of dental practices located in Florida, Arizona and Virginia.
“We are thrilled to be partnering with Huron Capital,” said Dr. Alex Giannini, DDP’s CEO.  “We see a significant opportunity to continue building DDP and are grateful to have a like-minded partner in Huron who can provide the capital and operational expertise necessary to help us do so. We anticipate making several more acquisitions to continue expanding our footprint and partnering with dentists to provide exceptional quality of care to as many patients as possible.”
Huron aligned with DDP’s management team to provide the investment necessary to bring together the current network of practices with capital reserved to fund future acquisitions. The transaction marks Huron’s second investment in the dental industry, having acquired a majority interest in short-term cosmetic orthodontics provider Six Month Smiles, Inc. in January 2013.  The dental market is a $119 billion industry and growing steadily according to IBISWorld.
“Huron identified the DSO market as an industry of focus nearly two years ago, and we have found an ideal platform on which to build in DDP,” commented Huron Partner Nick Barker.  “DDP has a deep and experienced management team with a long track record of successfully identifying and executing acquisitions in the dental market, and we are excited to be partnering with them to continue growing the business.”

Huron Adds to Team for Rollout of Fund IV
July 17,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”), one of the nation’s leading middle market private equity firms, today announced the growth of its team to source, close and manage investments. Huron has added four executives who will serve in business development, investment sourcing and execution roles to help deploy its recently-raised $500 million fund, The Huron Fund IV, LP.
Heather Madland, vice president of deal origination, will be responsible for Huron’s business development and investment sourcing activities. Madland brings 15 years of business development, marketing, sponsorship and relationship management experience to Huron. Most recently, she served as a director with SPP Capital Partners, a New York-based investment bank focused on raising debt and equity capital for middle market companies, where she was responsible for all West Coast operations and business development activities.
Mark Miller joins Huron’s transaction team as vice president and will be responsible for sourcing, analyzing, closing and managing investments. Prior to Huron, Miller was a senior associate with Glencoe Capital where he successfully evaluated investment opportunities and companies for the firm.  Miller previously worked for JPMorgan’s Mid-Corporate Investment Banking Group, where he handled M&A and debt and equity analysis.
Huron also announced the addition of two analysts, Tod Pesses and Mike Zukas, who will be responsible for investment evaluation and analysis. Pesses joins Huron after serving in corporate development roles at CareFusion and Cardinal Health. Zukas previously held roles at R. H. Bluestein and Co., Rothschild and North American Management Corp.
“With our new hires, we have significantly bolstered our sourcing and execution capabilities” said Brian Demkowicz, Huron’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner. “Our team is well positioned to continue building on Huron’s long history of making companies bigger and better”.

Investment Marks Culmination of Dental Industry Initiative
February 11,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”) announced today that it has invested in Six Month Smiles.  Founded in 2006 by Dr. Ryan Swain, Six Month Smiles is a clinically proven and economical approach to adult cosmetic orthodontics used by thousands of general dentists in the US, Canada, the UK, and Ireland.  Huron, in partnership with independent sponsor equity group Exium Partners, made the investment with a plan to continue growing the business through geographic expansion and new product offerings.  The Six Month Smiles transaction builds on Huron’s prior experience and success investing in the business services market and is the culmination of an active effort to identify investments specifically in the dental market.  This latest investment was made through The Huron Fund III L.P., a $350 million private equity fund which closed in 2008.
“We’re excited about this investment,” said Dr. Swain.  “Six Month Smiles has grown rapidly over the past several years and this is the right time for us to reinvest in market expansion. As we continue to lead the market with our Short Term Ortho system, we believe the operational experience from our new investors will help us reach new heights.”
“Six Month Smiles has a proven management team, a scalable business model, a dedicated employee base, and loyal customers,” said Huron Partner, Nick Barker.  “We are excited to be partnering with the Six Month Smiles management team and working with them in growing the business going forward.”

Hughes Bolsters Capabilities With Acquisition of Anoba Consulting Services
Detroit, MI – December 11, 2012 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”) announced today that its portfolio company, Hughes Associates, Inc. (“Hughes”), has acquired Anoba Consulting Services LLC (“Anoba”).  Anoba is a niche engineering firm specializing in probabilistic risk assessment (“PRA”) and other highly-technical risk-modeling services.  Mandated by the federal government, PRA utilizes highly analytical software programs and risk models that allow nuclear power plants to assess the underlying operational risks in their business and the potential impact of catastrophic events.
Prior to the acquisition, Anoba had been a key strategic partner for Hughes, often serving as a subcontractor on its nuclear power generation consulting projects.  The transaction brings Anoba and Hughes together and expands Hughes’ capabilities in the rapidly growing PRA industry.
Liz Kleinsorg, Managing Director of Hughes’ Power Division, noted, “We are thrilled to join forces with Rick Anoba and his industry leading team of PRA engineers.  The acquisition extends our presence in another high-growth, niche engineering segment of the industry and provides opportunities to generate new revenue streams from new and existing customers.”
Phil DiNenno, CEO of Hughes, added, “Anoba is a highly-regarded name in the PRA field and we believe it fits well into the strategic acquisition plan that we are currently pursuing in partnership with Huron Capital.”
Huron originally invested in Hughes in May 2011, and was attracted to Hughes’ market leading position in the fire protection engineering market and ability to serve as a platform for growth.  “When we invested in Hughes, our plan was to build the business both through strategic acquisitions and internal growth.  We continue to deliver on that plan with this second add-on and look forward to pursuing additional opportunities with Phil DiNenno and the rest of the Hughes management team,” said Huron Partner Peter Mogk.

Coffee Roaster and Distributor Marks Huron’s 60th Investment
Detroit, MI – September 4, 2012 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”) announced today that it has recapitalized Ronnoco Holdings, Inc. (“Ronnoco”) in a transaction marking the 60th investment overall for Huron.  Founded in 1904 and based in St. Louis, MO, Ronnoco manufactures and distributes premium quality coffee, tea and related products sold to convenience stores, foodservice outlets and offices throughout the central United States.  Huron, in partnership with Ronnoco’s management team, made the investment with a plan to continue growing the business through geographic expansion, new product offerings and acquisitions.  The Ronnoco transaction builds on Huron’s prior experience and success investing in consumer product and food businesses.  This latest investment was made through The Huron Fund III, L.P., a $350 million private equity fund raised in 2008.
Dan Moloney, President of Ronnoco, stated, “The Ronnoco name has been synonymous with premium quality coffee and world-class customer service for its one-hundred plus year history.  We are excited about our ability to build on this reputation while continuing to provide our customers with the same great products and service that they have come to expect in Ronnoco’s long history. Huron’s strong track record and experience in similar businesses makes them the perfect partner for us, and we are thrilled to be working together with them.”
“With a solid management team in place, significant excess capacity, and several avenues for continued growth, we believe Ronnoco is a solid platform on which to build,” said Huron Partner John Higgins.  “We are excited to be partnering with the Ronnoco team and working with them in growing the business going forward.”

Our Technology



 







Slendertone - A Unique Workout
A strong core offers much more than toned abs and firmer tummy muscles  – it helps you run further, jump higher, sit straighter, stand taller and feel amazing.

























































 








How does Slendertone's EMS technology works? 

 









 





    During exercise or everyday activities like carrying shopping bags or keeping your back straight while sitting at your desk, the brain sends signals to the muscles via the nerves, making them contract and relax.


    Slendertone, instead, utilises clinically-proven electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) technology to emit signals directly from the belt to your abdominal muscles, causing them to contract, work and relax in a similar way.


    As well as the upper, lower and oblique abdominal muscles, Slendertone also works the deep and difficult to activate transversus abdominis (Coughlan, 2008). This muscle is the most effective at flattening the stomach and is extremely tricky to tone with conventional exercise and abs workouts.


    You don't have to worry about your form or come up with the time to get it done. Slendertone Ab belts are clinically demonstrated to deliver firmer, stronger and more toned abdominal muscles while you are: at home, at work, watching TV, exercising, folding laundry, helping your kids with their homework, taking a walk...












What makes our abs belts so unique and effective?

 


















    Slendertone offers more than just high-tech EMS. Every feature and technical specification has been expertly engineered to tone deeper and achieve a stronger core, making it the most effective toning belt on the market.


Work your core any time, any place


    “I just don’t have enough time.” We’ve all said it before.


    For many people with an already packed schedule, squeezing in one more thing can feel overwhelming. Our belts can be worn during day-to-day activities, ab workouts and light circuits and exercise plans. You can tone your core without having to think about it nor plan it!


The perfect abdominal contraction


    Our 50Hz electrical pulse frequency is proven to give maximum muscle toning. Slendertone® belts will stimulate all your major stomach muscles at the same time providing you with the perfect abdominal contraction - that means your upper abs, the lower abs, the obliques and even the deep transversus muscle!


    No more back pain while doing your sit-ups! Slendertone® belts will do the work for you.


FDA cleared technology


    Slendertone® Abdominal belts are the first abdominal training systems cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve abdominal muscle tone, strengthen abdominal muscles and develop a firmer abdomen.


Medical graded belt fit and design


    The unique construction of Slendertone® features three pre-positioned, medical-grade Gel Pads, covering the central abdominals and external obliques. The gel pads have a unique conductive mesh which evenly distributes the stimulating signals for the most effective and comfortable abs workouts.


    Finally, the compression belt is specifically sculpted to keep gel pads in full contact with the skin. This ensures that you’re getting the most out of every session.












The clinical research speaks for itself (and so do our results)

 





    We work with independent professionals and leading universities to ensure that the clinical trials we conduct meet the highest possible efficacy standards.


    Trials conducted by Dr John P. Porcari, Professor in Exercise and Sports Science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (2005 and 2009), found that:







100%of users achieved firmer abs and improved definition from 6 weeks.





72%increase in users abdominal endurance from 6 weeks





49%increase in users abdominal strength from 6 weeks







Dr. Porcari Clinical Research




 



Elizabeth Before & After
See all Before & Afters




 







    *To achieve the best results, we recommend toning at least 5 times per week during your six-week Slendertone program.






Slendertone workouts are the most efficient and effective method for toning the essential abdominal muscles simultaneously, including the deep transversus abdominis, which is tricky to train with conventional sports and exercises.
 










What does Slendertone feel like?

 









 





    When you first turn it on, the feeling may be a little strange.


    As you increase the intensity, the sensation goes from a mild, tingly feeling to distinct muscle contractions. This is when our muscle toner (and you) are optimizing your workout.


    The sensation is powerful but still comfortable enough to hold a conversation, work at your desk or do chores around the house while using it.


    In comparison to other abs belt brands, Slendertone uses large hydrogel pads to conduct stimulating electrical pulses to your muscles. Our gel pads are medically-graded and consist of three layers, to spread the stimulation comfortably and effectively.


    As with any workout, your muscles may feel a little sore after your training session.


    Everyone’s starting point and training level is different. Set your own toning goals and increase them at your own pace!












For the best results, make Slendertone part of a healthy, holistic lifestyle

 




















    There are no quick fixes when it comes to toned abs and stronger core muscles. For the best results, we recommend using Slendertone as part of a more active lifestyle with regular exercise and healthy eating.


    You can use Slendertone during light exercise to enhance every movement, whether it’s during your abs workout or in your yoga and Pilates class.


    Slendertone abs belts and products can also be discreetly equipped when performing simple day-to-day tasks like walking to work, cooking and cleaning the house, or even just sitting behind your desk.


    If you’ve just started leading a healthier lifestyle, we’re here to help you every step of the way.


    For training plans, abs workouts, motivational tips, healthy meals and new and exciting ways to keep fit and have fun, you can find all the information and inspiration you need on our blog. Visit the Slendertone blog >

             muscles. With The Flex Belt, you can train your abs even if you're too busy or too tired for a traditional workout. Just slip on
              the comfortable toning ab belt and the clinically demonstrated, patented medical-grade technology
              stimulates the nerves that make your muscles contract and relax. As a result, you get an effective abdominal workout that targets 
              all the muscles in your abdomen – all in just 30 minutes a day.

			Our Motto is Eat Right, Exercise and Use The Flex Belt...
            



            The Flex Belt will stimulate all your major stomach muscles at the same time providing 
            you with the perfect abdominal contraction – that means your upper abs, the lower abs 
            and even your obliques are going to get worked from The Flex Belt... and it does all the 
            work for you. You don't have to worry about your form or come up with the time to get it 
            done. The Flex Belt is clinically demonstrated to deliver firmer, stronger and more toned

virtually anytime and anywhere.




    	The unique construction of the Flex Belt® features three
pre-positioned, medical-grade Gel Pads, covering the
central abdominals and external obliques.
During your toning session, signals from the Flex Belt® 
reach out to nerves where they are most concentrated. 
These nerves branch out to all of the stomach muscles
causing them to contract and relax naturally, working all
of the muscles at the same time, not just those
directly under the gel pads.

         

























The Flex Belt is not a gimmick – it is 100%  medical science. It is the first 
                                    EMS (Electric Muscle Stimulation) product of its kind cleared by the FDA

            The Flex Belt®  are a medical device company headquartered in Galway, Ireland with 40 years of

Ms Universe Figure
        			After winning the title Ms Universe Figure and seeing the judges' scores, I knew it was because of my hard work, dedication and finding things that helped me take my workouts to a higher level. Before I experienced The Flex Belt, I had a difficult time training my abs due to a car accident that left me with a bad back. Abdominal exercises hurt my lower back. Thanks to The Flex Belt, I am able to take my ab workout to a whole new level. The best part is I get a great, pain free ab workout in while helping the kids with their homework, making dinner or watching a movie. 
Fitness Expert and
					Trainer to the Stars
					Being an athlete and fitness model for most of my life I know that good abs come from a lot of hard work. As my schedule kept getting busier I was having a tough time fitting in my ab workouts because I was spending my exercise time on other things, which is when I decided to give this ab belt a try. I was blown away by how intense the contractions were on my abs and how unbelievable they felt after my first Flex Belt abdominal workout. What was even more incredible was the convenience of it. I could put The Flex Belt® on and continue my day.

Professional Body Builder"I was very impressed with a powerful contraction The Flex Belt gave me.  I train my abs hard and I can testify that if I increase the intensity to higher levels, even very fit people are going to be able to get a good ab workout.  I now use it in addition to my current workout program just to take me to the next level.  The Flex Belt is the real deal."

I have been using the product for the past few weeks now and have to say I am impressed with the results. It's easy... I can just pop it on when I am getting ready, and tone up at the same time. It's great."
