                What is geolocation and

                what do we use it for?


Geolocation is a tool we use to determine
                which of our offices services your area by identifying the country from which you
                are currently accessing our bookstore. If this is not the correct country, just
                change the location to the country you’re in. For further assistance, contact our office.
