The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The logo is a combination of C & V. The front V symbolizes growth and the back V symbolizes both stability and movement. The C is shaped to mimic a coin.

The fund’s equity is approximately 37 MEUR. During the next few years, the fund is expected to carry out more than ten projects and develop approximately thousand apartments to be sold primarily to private buyers.

As of today, the investments in the Baltic States have been mainly divested very profitably. Vicus continues to own large office and warehouse properties in St. Petersburg and Kiev, respectively. In Moscow, Vicus currently develops a large shopping and entertainment center. All investments in Russia and Ukraine are joint ventures with strong international and local partners.
