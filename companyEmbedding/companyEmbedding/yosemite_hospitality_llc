National Park Service Signs Contract with Yosemite Hospitality
Oct 7 15
National Park Service signed a concession contract with Yosemite Hospitality, LLC, a subsidiary of Aramark, to provide concession services within Yosemite National Park. The 15-year contract, the large single contract in the National Park Service, will begin on March 1, 2016. The current concessioner, DNC Parks & Resorts at Yosemite Inc., a subsidiary of Delaware North Co., has held its contract since 1993. As the new concessioner, Yosemite Hospitality will continue to provide visitor services at Yosemite National Park iconic locations. Millions of visitors will continue to enjoy services at historic locations including The Ahwahnee, Curry Village, Wawona, and Yosemite Lodge. The contract includes the operation of 17 retail locations, 12 lodging properties, and 14 food and beverage service locations. In 2014, the current contract gross receipts were $146 million. Yosemite Hospitality will pay a franchise fee of 11.75% of gross receipts, 80% of which will directly support improvements to visitor facilities and park operations. This was 3.75% higher than the minimum franchise fee required in the prospectus of 8.0% of gross receipts. Popular visitor services such as lodging and food service will continue at The Ahwahnee, Glacier Point, Yosemite Lodge, Wawona, Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, High Sierra Camps, and Curry Village. In addition, activities such as ice skating, skiing, bicycle rentals, shuttle service, and raft rentals will continue to be authorized for park visitors under the new contract. Horseback rides will be available in the Wawona area. The Yosemite Mountaineering School will continue at Badger Pass, Curry Village and Tuolumne Meadows. Major improvements will be made to food and beverage service at Degnan's Deli and Loft, Yosemite Lodge Food Court, and the Curry Village food service facilities. These improvements will be made by Yosemite Hospitality at no cost to the National Park Service. In addition, enhanced menus embracing healthy food options will be implemented at all locations. Yosemite Hospitality will reduce the concession footprint of facilities and operations within Yosemite Valley. Operational efficiencies gained from proposed improvements will enable Yosemite Hospitality to reduce the footprint associated with concessioner activities. Yosemite Hospitality will implement major conservation activities to reduce water, electricity, and fuel use in shuttle systems, lodging, employee housing, and food outlets. Water and energy saving fixtures will be installed, or upgraded as needed, throughout lodging and employee housing areas. The park concession facilities will become a model of sustainability and enhance resource protection. Significant investments will be made in upgrading room furniture and amenities in lodging at The Ahwahnee, Curry Village, and Wawona.

A New Day: Aramark Begins Concessions Operations at Yosemite National Park
Yosemite’s new concessioner working to ensure a smooth transition for guests;  Program enhancements and service upgrades on the horizon

Yosemite National Park, CA (March 1, 2016) –  Yosemite Hospitality, LLC, a subsidiary of Aramark (NYSE: ARMK), the award-winning food and hospitality partner for national and state parks, is pleased to announce today marks its first day as the new concessioner at Yosemite National Park. Last summer the National Park Service awarded Aramark the 15-year contract to manage Yosemite’s hospitality programs encompassing lodging, food & beverage, retail, recreational and transportation services.
“Aramark has a long history with the National Park Service and we are excited to be partnering with them to create great new memories for Yosemite’s many enthusiasts who hold the park so near and dear to their hearts,” said Bruce W. Fears, President of Aramark’s Leisure Division and longtime park industry thought leader. “I also have a deep appreciation for Yosemite and am proud of the tireless effort and commitment our team has undertaken, in conjunction with the National Park Service, to prepare for a smooth opening and transition for guests. As part of our Park stewardship, we look forward to introducing innovative programs and experiences that further shape the legacy of this awe-inspiring and iconic Park.”
Today also marks the official debut of www.travelyosemite.com, Yosemite Hospitality’s online destination for lodging, activity and tour information for Yosemite National Park. Visitors can also connect with Aramark on Facebook: Facebook.com/TravelYosemite, Instagram: @TravelYosemite, and Twitter: @TravelAramark.
Guest Experience Enhancements 
While future plans include upgrading and improving facilities and enhancing existing programming around the Park, Yosemite Hospitality’s immediate focus during the transition period is to ensure a seamless transition for guests, assimilate and onboard employees and acclimate new personnel to the Park. 
Early on, the emphasis will be on enhancements to customer service as well as dining service. Later this year, Degnan’s Deli and Loft is scheduled to be renovated. Longer term plans include remodeling the food court at Yosemite Valley Lodge and the dining areas at Half Dome Village. The transformation of these locations is designed to modernize their look, improve efficiency and increase speed of service.
Future improvements to guest rooms throughout Yosemite’s lodgings, including new in-room amenities, furnishings and accessibility, will also be part of Aramark’s overall investment in the guest experience. Technology upgrades and improvements are also on the horizon. Guests will eventually be able to use smart phones for making reservations and placing and paying for orders. Food ordering kiosks will allow visitors to place and pay for orders without having to enter dining facilities until orders are ready.
All of these efforts will enhance the guest experience at Yosemite, allowing visitors to experience the full majesty of Yosemite while also enjoying the comfort, convenience, and service Aramark is known for providing. 
Workforce Transition
Aramark has a long track record of successfully managing concessions within the National Park system, however, the company recognizes the people most responsible for impacting the guest experience are the front line associates.
While the hiring process is ongoing, over 95 percent of the workforce is expected to transition to Aramark. Nearly every one of these employees worked at Yosemite previously, and they join Aramark with invaluable experience.
“Yosemite’s front line associates are personally and passionately dedicated to the Park and to the guests who visit. While Aramark may be the new concessioner, I’m pleased that so many of the names and faces of the staff remain the same,” said Bob Concienne, Vice President of Operations for Aramark at Yosemite National Park. “I’m excited to welcome them to the Aramark family and look forward to working with them to create a lifetime of memories for Yosemite’s visitors.”
Guest Reservations
All reservations and group contracts booked prior to March 1, 2016 will be honored.  Shortly, Aramark’s Central Reservations team will begin contacting guests to confirm existing reservations within the Park for future dates. To make, change or update a reservation, guests may call 888-413-8869 or visit www.travelyosemite.com for additional information.
Environmental Stewardship
Environmental sustainability is a fundamental part of Aramark’s mission, with a strategic focus on reducing the company’s environmental impact through innovative solutions that promote responsible sourcing, waste minimization, energy and water conservation, and transportation efficiencies. 
Yosemite Hospitality will further reduce its carbon footprint in the Park by maximizing operational efficiency, including reducing service vehicle traffic, installing a visitor vehicle charging station and minimizing food waste. Learn more about Aramark’s Leisure Division’s environmental practices and programs here.
Community Partnerships
Aramark’s community involvement and philanthropic efforts leverage the unique skills and expertise of its employees who have a passion for service and volunteerism and contribute their time, expertise and resources through Aramark Building Community which is focused on fostering strong, vibrant, successful communities in local neighborhoods.  
At Yosemite, Aramark looks forward to establishing a meaningful community presence and positively impacting the community by partnering with local organizations, working with business leaders and participating in community-wide projects. Aramark is also excited to be working with and supporting Yosemite Conservancy and Yosemite’s Gateway Partners.
About Aramark’s Leisure Division
Aramark’s Leisure division delivers authentic and memorable experiences at 60 national and state parks, national forests, conference centers, specialty hotels, museums and other tourist destinations throughout the United States. In partnership with its clients, Aramark seeks to enhance the guest experience by offering industry-leading hospitality, environmental stewardship, recreational and interpretive programs. Connect with us on Twitter at @TravelAramark.

As a longtime supporter of the NPS and America’s national parks, Aramark is proud to be a sponsor of the National Park Foundation’s Centennial Campaign, celebrating the National Park Service’s 100th anniversary, this year.

Travel Alert Update




TRAVEL ALERT: you may have heard news of a wildfire near the Yosemite gateway town of Mariposa that closed Highway 140 access to Yosemite. As of July 24th we have confirmed that Highway 140 to Yosemite has re-opened and the town of Mariposa is open for business as usual. Since Rush Creek Lodge is located near the Highway 120 west entrance to Yosemite, the temporary closure at Highway 140 did not affect travel to the lodge or access between the lodge and Yosemite Valley in any way. News of the fire has caused a significant increase…Read More »






Yosemite Overview




Yosemite National Park is one of the most spectacular places on Earth and is a nature-lover’s paradise. Yosemite offers a diverse landscape filled with rivers, glacial carved valleys, picturesque alpine meadows and peaks, several of the world’s highest and most spectacular waterfalls, and the world’s largest trees and tallest granite walls. There is much to see in Yosemite, and for those willing to seek out the paths less traveled, some particularly amazing discoveries and experiences await. To truly appreciate what Yosemite has to offer, we recommend spending at least three days exploring the Park. While the…Read More »






Hetch Hetchy Valley




Hetch Hetchy Valley Overview The Hetch Hetchy Valley is one of Yosemite’s hidden jewels. Formed millions of years ago by water and glacial erosion, this stunning valley (half the size of Yosemite Valley) was described by naturalist John Muir as “a grand landscape garden, one of Nature’s rarest and most precious mountain temples.” Hetch Hetchy has always been overshadowed by its twin sister, Yosemite Valley. We like it that way since the Hetch Hetchy area remains a serene and uncrowded oasis. Visitors are constantly surprised and impressed by the beauty of Hetch Hetchy. And since Hetch…Read More »

Yosemite Weather & Seasonal Conditions




Yosemite is a remarkable place with picture-perfect weather nearly 9 months a year. Most days are bright and sunny with cool, comfortable (and, at times, crisp) evenings. Thanks to the generosity of the Yosemite Conservancy and their donors, we can see El Capitan, Half Dome, the High Country, and Yosemite Falls in real time. Keep in mind that Rush Creek Lodge is at an elevation that is 600 feet higher than the Yosemite Valley, so the temperature tends to be a few degrees cooler at the lodge. Spring is a time of transition with booming waterfalls…Read More »

What to Bring




There are a few essentials that make for a more enjoyable Yosemite getaway, and your needs will vary depending on how adventurous you would like to be when you’re here.  Whenever you are on a road trip through the great outdoors it’s best to carry plenty of drinking water and snacks, and keep your gas tank topped off for those long stretches of scenic roads. The closest gasoline to the west of Rush Creek Lodge can be found 22.5 miles away in the town of Groveland.  Traveling east on Highway 120 the closest gasoline is 9.5…Read More »

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

NPS selects Aramark over Delaware North

                    June 17, 2015 2:21 PM
                



The National Park Service (NPS) has selected Yosemite Hospitality, LLC, a subsidiary of Aramark, to receive the new primary concession contract for providing visitor services in Yosemite National Park. The 15-year contract worth nearly $2 billion is expected to begin on March 1, 2016, and will include overnight accommodations, food and beverage operations, retail sales, fuel sales, bike and raft rentals, and a variety of other recreational activities throughout the park.
“We’re very excited about bringing on Aramark to operate our primary concessions,” stated Yosemite Superintendent Don Neubacher. “Aramark brings tremendous resources to the table and has extensive experience in operating concessions at many other national parks. We believe they’ll be a great partner with us at Yosemite as we work to implement the vision of the Merced River Plan.”
Aramark has gross revenues of $14.8 billion and employs more than 270,000 employees in 21 countries and currently holds eight other NPS contracts with gross revenues of  more than $110 million in 2013.
Aramark will provide a variety of services to the public, including continuing to operate the Yosemite Valley shuttle system free of charge to all visitors. Additionally, under the new contract, concession operations will achieve several operational improvements including reducing vehicle traffic in Yosemite Valley, increasing water conservation, reducing electricity and fuel usage, and enhancing food and beverage operations for visitors.
“We’re excited and honored to have been selected by NPS to serve as Yosemite’s concessioner,” David Freireich, Aramark Corporate Communications, said. “Specific details about our plans will be announced over the next few months, but I can tell you our goal is to elevate the guest and visitor experience by introducing new offerings, upgrading amenities, and enhancing existing programs.”




“The NPS is a longtime and valued partner and we look forward to enhancing Yosemite’s guest experience with a variety of distinctive hospitality and service offerings and educational and interpretive programming,” said Bruce W. Fears, president of Aramark’s Leisure division. “Yosemite is one of America’s most treasured resources and important natural preserves and we are excited to work with the NPS as a steward of the park’s rich history and to help shape its legacy moving forward.”
The contract has been sent to Aramark for signature and, once signed, will be transmitted to Congress for a 60-day notice period as stipulated by law. After this period, the NPS will sign and award the contract, then work with the existing concessioner and Aramark to complete an orderly transition.
DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. has operated under the existing contract since 1993, grossing over $146 million in 2014. They recently completed a well-received upgrade to the furnishings in all rooms at Yosemite Lodge and have operated and maintained two of the park’s National Historic Landmarks and major visitor attractions, The Ahwahnee and the Wawona Hotel, completing numerous upgrades to these facilities over the course of their contract. 
“Throughout its tenure as the park’s primary concessioner, DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. provided quality services and unforgettable experiences to millions of visitors,” said Neubacher. “We appreciate all of their work.”
In a prepared statement, a spokesman for Delaware North said the company is proud of the hospitality, stewardship, and community support provided by its operating subsidiary, DNC Parks & Resorts (Delaware North at Yosemite), in Yosemite National Park for more than 22 years. 



“Although we are disappointed that Delaware North at Yosemite was not selected to continue its decades of service in Yosemite National Park, we would like to congratulate Aramark on being awarded the Yosemite concession contract,” the statement read. “Delaware North has a passion for national parks, and we remain committed to our Yosemite operation, providing quality hospitality for park visitors through the contract period ending February 29, 2016. Delaware North is focused on providing a smooth transition for Yosemite associates and park visitors.”
Prior to 1998, concession law provided broad rights granting preferential right of renewal to incumbent concessioners. Since 1998, with the passage of an act reforming concessions management, issuance of most concession contracts generally became subject to fair and open competition with no preferential right of renewal for the incumbent and bids are evaluated and awarded via a competitive process.

Frequently Asked Questions About the new Concessions Contract






The purpose of concessioners in parks is to provide necessary and appropriate visitor services that government agencies do not traditionally provide. Generally these are overnight accommodations, food and beverage, and retail services, but may also include other services such as guided trips, transportation services, auto fuel, and a variety of other services, depending on the park.

The purpose of the prospectus process is to solicit the opportunity for the operation of services and facilities to interested parties competitively and find the best offer that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the contract. 

General Contract Questions

Q: What is the timeline to begin the new contract?
A: The expected start date of the Contract is March 1, 2016.

Q: What is the term of the Contract? 
A: The Contract is for a term of 15 years

Q: How long has the current contract been extended?
A: The Existing Contract was originally set to expire on September 30, 2008 and has been extended and continued since that time, due mainly to litigation over the Merced Wild and Scenic River Plan.


Process Questions

Q: Why did it take so long to update the contract?
Q: Why was the contract extended?
A: Development of the prospectus for the Contract was delayed by extensive litigation on the Merced Wild and Scenic River Management Plan (MRP). The prospectus incorporated key components of the final MRP, including the types of visitor facilities and services that could be included in the Contract and where each would be located.

Q: When was the prospectus open for bid and who could bid on it?
A: The solicitation for the prospectus opened on July 9, 2014 and was open to any company or individual interested in operating the facilities and services required by the Contract.

Q: Who actually made the selection?
Q: How was the selection made?
A: An evaluation panel, made up of NPS employees and technical advisors, analyzed the proposals received and provided a recommendation to the Director for the selected Offeror. The selection was made in accordance with the provisions of the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 (1998 Act). The 1998 Act made a number of changes in how concession contracts are awarded in order to enhance competition. 

Q: When will the Contract be available to the public? 
A: The NPS has sent the Contract to Yosemite Hospitality, LLC to review how we incorporated the terms of its proposal. Once reviewed and signed, the NPS will transmit the Contract to Congress for a 60-day notice period as stipulated by law. After this Congressional notice period the NPS will sign and award the Contract and work with the parties to complete an orderly transition for a Contract start date of March 1, 2016.

Q: What happens in the interim between the selection and signing of the Contract? 
A: The NPS begins the process of working with Yosemite Hospitality, LLC to ensure a smooth transition with little disruption to park visitors.

Q: How long does Congress have to review the Contract?
A: Congress is provided the Contract for a 60 day notice period. It is not required to review or act on the Contract.

Q: Why is Congress provided a notice period?
A: It is a requirement of the 1998 Act.

Q: When is the transition period?
A: The transition period begins once the Contract is signed by both Yosemite Hospitality, LLC and the NPS, after the Congressional notice period. 


How was the Decision Made Questions

Q: What were the primary areas the NPS was looking at in the prospectus to determine the best offer?    
Q: What were the principal factors the NPS considered?
A: The NPS asked for proposals related to the following:


Consideration of traffic and congestion to reduce the Concessioner’s administrative footprint within Yosemite Valley as specified in the Merced River Plan
Water conservation
Improvements to the food and beverage operations at Curry Village, Degnan’s, and Yosemite Lodge (e.g. menu variety, operational efficiency)
Operational experience and ability to attract and retain employees
Preservation, repair, and maintenance of historic structures
Financial capability
Minimum franchise fee
Reduction of electricity and fuel use throughout operations
Continued maintenance of Yosemite Valley and Wawona operations while opening and closing the High Sierra Camps, Tuolumne Lodge, and White Wolf Lodge
Regular upgrade and replacement of personal property at The Ahwahnee, Curry Village, and Wawona Hotel and proper maintenance personal property at all lodging operations throughout the Contract term



Q: Why was Yosemite Hospitality, LLC selected as the better Offeror?
Q: What things made the difference in the proposals?
A: Yosemite Hospitality, LLC was recommended by the panel for award of the Contract for a number of reasons related to its response to the questions asked in the Prospectus. These included responses regarding reducing traffic in Yosemite Valley, increasing water conservation, reducing electricity and fuel usage, enhancing food and beverage outlets to meet visitor expectations, upgrading personal property for overnight accommodations, and maintaining NPS-owned facilities assigned to the Concessioner.

Operational Questions

Q: Are we going to see a lot of new hotels and new recreational activities in the park?
A: No, through the MRP and Contract development process, the building of new hotel facilities is not permissible within the Park. The Concessioner must obtain NPS written approval for any construction, including rehabilitation, taking place on Concession Facilities within the Park.

Q: Will the new Concessioner continue to operate the shuttle buses and will they be free? 
A: Yes, the Contract requires the Concessioner to continue operating the Yosemite Valley shuttle system free of charge to all visitors. The Contract also authorizes the Concessioner to operate a shuttle circulating between Olmsted Point overlook and Tuolumne Meadows and a shuttle from Yosemite Valley to Badger Pass. The Concessioner will be permitted to charge for these two routes.

Q: What will happen to the amenities such as the bike and raft rentals and ice rink?
A: These services are authorized under the new Contract; however at this time the specific location for each service has not yet been determined. Locations will be proposed by the new Concessioner and approved by the NPS.

National Park Service Selects Yosemite Hospitality, LLC (a subsidiary of Aramark) for Primary Concession Contract

Fifteen-Year Contract includes providing overnight accommodations, food and beverage, retail, and other related services to park visitors
 
The National Park Service (NPS) has selected Yosemite Hospitality, LLC, a subsidiary of Aramark, to receive the new primary concession contract for providing visitor services in Yosemite National Park. The 15-year contract – the largest single concession contract in the NPS – is expected to begin on March 1, 2016, and will include overnight accommodations, food and beverage operations, retail sales, fuel sales, bike and raft rentals, and a variety of other recreational activities throughout the park.
 
“We’re very excited about bringing on Aramark to operate our primary concessions,” stated Yosemite Superintendent Don Neubacher. “Aramark, brings tremendous resources to the table, and has extensive experience in operating concessions at many other national parks. We believe they’ll be a great partner with us at Yosemite as we work to implement the vision of the Merced River Plan.”
 
Aramark has gross revenues of $14.8 billion and employs more than 270,000 employees in 21 countries and currently holds eight other NPS contracts with gross revenues of over $110 million in 2013, including concessions at Lake Mead and Glen Canyon National Recreation Areas, as well as Mesa Verde, Olympic, Denali, and Glacier Bay National Parks.
 
Aramark will provide a variety of services to the public, including continuing to operate the Yosemite Valley shuttle system free of charge to all visitors. Additionally, under the new contract, concession operations will achieve several operational improvements including reducing vehicle traffic in Yosemite Valley, increasing water conservation, reducing electricity and fuel usage, and enhancing food and beverage operations for visitors.
 
The contract has been sent to Aramark for signature and, once signed, will be transmitted to Congress for a 60-day notice period as stipulated by law. After this period, the NPS will sign and award the contract, then work with the existing concessioner and Aramark to complete an orderly transition.
 
DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. has operated under the existing contract since 1993, grossing over $146 million in 2014. They recently completed a well-received upgrade to the furnishings in all rooms at Yosemite Lodge and have operated and maintained two of the park’s National Historic Landmarks and major visitor attractions, The Ahwahnee and the Wawona Hotel, completing numerous upgrades to these facilities over the course of their contract. “Throughout its tenure as the park’s primary concessioner, DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, Inc. provided quality services and unforgettable experiences to millions of visitors,” stated Yosemite National Park Superintendent Don Neubacher. “We appreciate all of their work.” 
 
Prior to 1998, concession law provided broad rights granting preferential right of renewal to incumbent concessioners. Since 1998, with the passage of an act reforming concessions management, issuance of most concession contracts generally became subject to fair and open competition with no preferential right of renewal for the incumbent and bids are evaluated and awarded via a competitive process.
