Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds. Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accouts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

VIRTUS ADVISER TRUST - DEF 14A - 20050413 - PROPOSAL_3





PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF THE NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT




A COPY OF THE PROPOSED NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY AS
EXHIBIT B.




REQUIRED VOTE



Approval of the New Subadvisory Agreement as to either Fund requires the
affirmative Majority Vote of the Fund with all share classes voting together
with respect to the Fund. If the New Subadvisory Agreement is not approved by
the shareholders of either Fund, Vontobel would continue as subadviser to the
Funds under the terms of the current Investment Subadvisory Agreements until the
expiration of such agreements, and the Board of Trustees would consider the
options available to the Funds.


24






THE CURRENT SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS



Vontobel, 450 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022, is each Fund's
subadviser. Vontobel is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Vontobel is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Vontobel Holding AG, Todistrasse 27, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland, a Swiss bank
holding company which is traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange. The Vontobel
family, through different investment vehicles, owns approximately 40% of
Vontobel Holding AG. The following persons serve as the principal executive
officers of Vontobel at the address for Vontobel listed above: Herbert J.
Scheidt, Chairman; Christoph Ledergerber, Vice-Chairman; Henry Schlegel,
President and CEO; Thomas P. Wittwer, Senior Vice-President; Edwin D. Walczak,
Senior Vice-President; Peter Newell, Senior Vice-President; Rajiv Jain, Senior
Vice-President; Joseph Mastoloni, Vice-President/Compliance; Oliver A. Haberli,
Vice-President; Alfred Nyffeler, Chief Financial Officer; Guenter Faschang,
Vice-President; Igor Krutov, Vice-President; Sangam Sogani, Vice-President and
Senior Research Analyst; and Zeno Staub, Director. The principal occupation of
each principal executive officer is the officer's position with Vontobel.


The Current Subadvisory Agreement for each Fund between Vontobel and JCM
obligate Vontobel to: (i) make investment decisions on behalf of the Fund; (ii)
place all orders for the purchase and sale of investments for the Fund with
brokers or dealers selected by Vontobel; (iii) vote all proxies for portfolio
securities; and (iv) perform certain limited related administrative functions in
connection therewith. The Current Subadvisory Agreements provide that Vontobel
shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss
arising out of any investment or for any act or omission taken with respect to
the Funds, except for willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties, or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations
and duties thereunder and except to the extent otherwise provided by law.


The Funds pay no fees directly to Vontobel as the subadviser. Under the
Current Subadvisory Agreements, Vontobel is compensated with respect to each
Fund by JCM at the following annual rates as a percentage of the Fund's average
daily net asset value:








FOCUSED VALUE FUND
  First $100 Million........................................  0.740%
  Increment between $100 Million and $300 Million...........  0.415%
  Increment between $300 Million and $500 Million...........  0.365%
  Increment between $500 Million and $1 Billion.............  0.325%
  Increment between $1 Billion and $1.4 Billion.............  0.285%
  Increment equal to or in excess of $1.4 Billion...........  0.215%
INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND
  First $500 Million........................................  0.408%
  Increment between $500 Million and $1 Billion.............  0.325%
  Increment between $1 Billion and $1.4 Billion.............  0.285%
  Increment equal to or in excess of $1.4 Billion...........  0.215%








Each Current Subadvisory Agreement is dated August 5, 2003, and was last
submitted to a vote of the Funds' shareholders on September 19, 2003, as part of
a reorganization of series of Vontobel Funds, Inc. into the corresponding series
of the Trust. The initial term of each Current Subadvisory Agreement continues
until July 1, 2005. Each Current Subadvisory Agreement is subject to termination
by JCM or Vontobel on 60 days' written notice and terminates automatically in
the event of its assignment and in the event of termination of the Current
Advisory Agreement with respect to the relevant Fund. Each Current Subadvisory
Agreement will be terminated upon shareholder approval and execution of the New
Advisory Agreement and New Subadvisory Agreement.


JCM and Vontobel have entered into an additional agreement under which
Vontobel is restricted from being involved in the investment management or
underwriting of registered investment companies that have the same or
substantially equivalent investment style to Focused Value Fund or International
Equity Fund


25





until October 2006. That agreement also provides that JCM would be required to
pay certain liquidated damages to Vontobel if a Current Subadvisory Agreement
were terminated during its first three years, other than in certain
circumstances constituting cause. The Current Subadvisory Agreements are
proposed to be terminated by mutual agreement between JCM and Vontobel, waiving
any payment of liquidated damages related to such termination. In addition, this
agreement contemplates that JCM will make certain payments to Vontobel that are
designed to provide an incentive for Edwin Walczak, Senior Vice-President, to
remain at Vontobel. Any payments under that agreement would be made by JCM and
not by either of the Funds.


Vontobel acts as subadviser for 2 other U.S. registered mutual funds, as
well as a Luxembourg Investment Fund, and 15 offshore funds, and provides
separate account adviser services for institutional accounts. Investment
decisions for each account managed by Vontobel, including the Funds, are made
independently from those for any other account that is or may in the future
become managed by Vontobel. Vontobel currently serves as subadviser to one fund
that is similarly managed to International Equity Fund -- Penn Series
International Equity Fund ("Penn fund"). For providing subadvisory services to
Penn fund, Vontobel receives, on a monthly basis, a subadvisory fee based on
such fund's average daily net assets at the annual rate of 0.50%. Penn fund had
approximately $165.5 million in net assets as of December 31, 2004.





THE NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT



The terms of the New Subadvisory Agreement are substantially similar to
those of the Current Subadvisory Agreements. However, the fees paid to Vontobel
by PIC under the New Subadvisory Agreement with respect to each Fund would be at
the following annual rates as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net asset
value:






                                                               FOCUSED     INTERNATIONAL
                                                              VALUE FUND    EQUITY FUND
                                                              ----------   -------------
First $50 Million...........................................     0.70%         0.80%
Over $50 Million............................................    0.375%        0.425%








The following table summarizes the subadvisory fees paid by JCM and the pro
forma subadvisory fees that would have been paid under the New Subadvisory
Agreement for the indicated periods:








                               MARCH 1, 2004-          JANUARY 1-            OCTOBER 13-

Subject to completion of the Transaction, PIC and Vontobel have agreed that
PIC will not, subject to certain exceptions, terminate the New Subadvisory
Agreement for a period of three years following the closing of the Transaction.
PIC may terminate the New Subadvisory Agreement pursuant to the following
circumstances: (1) entry of an order against Vontobel that bars Vontobel from
serving as an investment adviser; (2) the initiation of an enforcement
proceeding against Vontobel that is grounded upon an alleged violation of law
and/or applicable regulation and appears likely to limit Vontobel's ability to
fulfill its duties under the New Subadvisory Agreement; (3) bankruptcy or
insolvency of Vontobel; (4) poor investment performance; or (5) significant
portfolio management personnel changes. If PIC terminated the New Subadvisory
Agreement for any other reason, PIC would be liable to Vontobel in the amount of
$1.75 million. In addition, PIC and Vontobel have agreed that should Vontobel be
removed without cause as subadviser to either series of the Trust within three
years, Vontobel will receive a payment from Phoenix of $1.75 million.


26





Furthermore, Vontobel has reserved the right to require PIC to submit and
recommend to the Phoenix funds' board of trustees a proposal jointly crafted by
Vontobel and PIC to reorganize International Equity Fund and Focused Value Fund
into one or more investment companies or funds that will utilize the services of
Vontobel as sole adviser or subadviser if PIC fails to gather additional assets
for Vontobel in the associated time periods:








12 months after the closing.................................   $100 million
24 months after the closing.................................   $200 million
36 months after the closing.................................   $300 million








provided, however, that the asset targets listed above shall be reduced by
twenty-five percent (25%) for any period in which one or both Funds' three-year
performance is in the bottom half of its peer group, and fifty percent (50%) for
any period in which one or both Funds' three-year performance is in the bottom
quartile of its peer group.



BASIS FOR THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION



Since the commencement of operations of the Trust, the Trustees have met at
least quarterly with senior officers of Vontobel. In addition, as noted above,
on three separate occasions they met with senior officers of Vontobel and others
to consider the proposed change of investment advisers and the proposed
continued engagement of Vontobel to manage the portfolios of the Funds. In
addition, they received and reviewed from Vontobel substantial written
information as requested by them. Throughout that process the Disinterested
Trustees were represented and advised by their own independent legal counsel. In
the course of their deliberations and evaluation of materials, the Trustees
considered, among other things, the following factors: (a) the investment
objective and strategy of each Fund; (b) Vontobel, its current personnel
(including particularly those personnel with responsibilities for providing
investment and compliance services to the Funds), and its financial condition,
resources and investment process; (c) the terms of the Current Subadvisory
Agreements and the terms of the proposed New Subadvisory Agreement, including
the standard of care and termination provisions; (d) the scope and quality of
the services that Vontobel has provided and will continue to provide to the
Funds; (e) the structure and rate of advisory fees payable to Vontobel by the
respective Funds, the structure and rate of investment management fees payable
to other subadvisers by comparable funds, the structure and rate of investment
management fees charged by Vontobel to other clients and possible alternative
fee structures; (f) the estimated total expense ratio of each Fund and of
comparable funds managed by other advisers; (g) the methodology used by Vontobel
in determining the compensation payable to portfolio managers and the
competition for investment management talent; (h) Vontobel's agreement to
discontinue the use of the Funds' portfolio brokerage transactions to obtain
third party research through brokers; (i) Vontobel's compliance record; and (j)
the competitive market for mutual funds in different distribution channels.


After consideration of the information referred to above, the Trustees
reached several conclusions. They concluded that the nature and extent of
Vontobel's services to the Funds was appropriate and consistent with the terms
of the New Subadvisory Agreement. They also concluded that the quality of
Vontobel's services to the Funds has been very good. In reaching their
conclusions, the Trustees considered the factors described above as well as the
following:


- Because Vontobel's principal responsibility is management of the Funds'
investment portfolios, the investment performance achieved by Vontobel is
an important indicator of the quality of services provided;


- The quality of Vontobel's services to the Funds has been consistent with
or superior to quality norms in the mutual fund industry;


- Vontobel has sufficient personnel, with the appropriate education and
experience, to serve the Funds effectively, and has demonstrated its
ability to attract and retain well qualified personnel; and


27





- Vontobel's financial condition is sound, and Vontobel is part of a much
larger financial services enterprise with very substantial financial
resources.


The Trustees concluded that the fees that PIC will pay to Vontobel under
the New Subadvisory Agreement are reasonable in relation to the nature and
quality of the services to be provided, taking into account the fees charged by
other advisers for managing comparable mutual funds with similar strategies and
the fees Vontobel charges to other clients.


The Trustees concluded that, other than the services to be provided by
Vontobel to the Funds pursuant to the proposed agreements and the fees to be
paid by PIC therefor, the Funds and Vontobel may potentially benefit from their
relationship with each other in other ways. They concluded that Vontobel would
benefit from the receipt of proprietary research products and services to be
acquired through commissions paid on portfolio transactions of the Funds and
that the Funds would benefit from Vontobel's receipt of those products and
services as well as research products and services acquired through commissions
paid by other clients of Vontobel. They also concluded that success of the Funds
could attract other business to Vontobel or its other funds and that the success
of Vontobel could enhance Vontobel's ability to serve the Funds.



THE TRUSTEES, INCLUDING ALL OF THE DISINTERESTED TRUSTEES, UNANIMOUSLY





RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT.
