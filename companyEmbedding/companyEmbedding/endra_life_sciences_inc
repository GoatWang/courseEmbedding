ENDRA Life Sciences Inc. Prices Initial Public Offering









PR Newswire




May 9, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































  ANN ARBOR, Mich., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ENDRA Life Sciences Inc. ("ENDRA" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: NDRAU), a developer of photo- and thermo-acoustic technology to bring new capabilities to existing ultrasound systems, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 1,680,000 units, each consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at an offering price of $5.00 per unit. The common stock and warrants will trade together as units during the first 60 days following the date of the prospectus pursuant to which the offering is being made (unless the underwriters' representative determines that an earlier date is acceptable) and, thereafter, the units will automatically separate and the common stock and warrants will trade separately. Following separation, each warrant will have an exercise price of $6.25 per share of common stock and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the original issuance date. The units are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on May 9, 2017 under the symbol "NDRAU." Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the shares of common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols "NDRA" and "NDRAW," respectively. The Company has also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 252,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any, provided that in no event may exercise of this option occur after separation of the units. ENDRA expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the development and regulatory approval and to prepare for the commercialization of the Company's Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound application in the European Union and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

	ENDRA Life Sciences Inc.




	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements




	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Note 1 – Nature of the Business




	 




	ENDRA
	Life Sciences Inc. (“ENDRA” or the
	“Company”) was incorporated on July 18, 2007 as a
	Delaware corporation.




	 




	ENDRA
	is developing a medical imaging technology based on the
	thermoacoustic effect that improves the sensitivity and specificity
	of clinical ultrasound.




	 




	On May
	8, 2017, the Company effected a one-for-3.5 reverse stock split
	(the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s common
	stock, with no reduction in authorized capital stock. In the
	Reverse Split, every 3.5 outstanding shares of common stock became
	one share of common stock. See Note 9 below.




	 




	All
	common stock and stock incentive plan information in these
	financial statements has been restated to reflect the Reverse
	Split.




	 




	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies




	 




	Use of Estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
	contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 




	Management
	makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred
	income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity
	instruments and reserves for any other commitments or
	contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized
	in the period in which such adjustments are
	determined.




	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 




	The accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes
	have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
	Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
	included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant
	to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all
	adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
	necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
	results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 are not
	necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
	year ended December 31, 2017. The balance sheet at December 31,
	2016 has been derived from the audited financial statements at such
	date. For further information, refer to the financial statements
	and footnotes thereto included in ENDRA Life Sciences Inc. annual
	financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included
	in Amendment No. 10 to the Company’s Registration Statement
	on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on May 1, 2017.




	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, including
	accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit and
	other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or
	less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of March
	31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no cash
	equivalents.




	 




	Inventory




	 




	The
	Company's inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated
	realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a
	weighted-average cost basis on the first-in, first-out
	(“FIFO”) method. The Company periodically determines
	whether a reserve should be taken for devaluation or obsolescence
	of inventory. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 no such
	reserve was taken.




	 






	 




	4










	 






	 




	Capitalization of Fixed Assets




	 




	The Company capitalizes expenditures related to property and
	equipment, subject to a minimum rule, that have a useful life
	greater than one year for: (1) assets purchased; (2) existing
	assets that are replaced, improved or the useful lives have been
	extended; or (3) all land, regardless of cost. Acquisitions of new
	assets, additions, replacements and improvements (other than land)
	costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and
	repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities,
	are expensed as incurred.




	 




	Capitalization of Intangible Assets




	 




	The Company records the purchase of intangible assets not purchased
	in a business combination in accordance with the ASC Topic
	350.




	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the requirements of
	ASC 605-10-599, which directs that it should recognize revenue when
	(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (contracts); (2)
	delivery has occurred; (3) the seller’s price is fixed or
	determinable (per the customer’s contract); and (4)
	collectability is reasonably assured (based upon our credit
	policy). For products sold to end users revenue is recognized when
	title has passed to the customer and collectability is reasonably
	assured; and no further efforts are required. Future revenue from
	anticipated new products will follow this same policy.




	 




	Advertising Expense




	 




	The
	cost of advertising is expensed as
	incurred. Advertising expense for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 was approximately $93. Advertising expense for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016 was approximately
	$180.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	The
	Company utilizes ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which
	requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
	the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
	included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
	method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
	the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
	their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and
	statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
	differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation
	allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not”
	that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.




	 




	The
	Company generated a deferred tax asset through net operating loss
	carry-forwards. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been
	established due to the uncertainty of the Company’s
	realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its
	expiration.




	 




	Research and Development Costs




	 




	The
	Company follows ASC 730-10, “Research and Development”.
	Research and development costs are charged to the statement of
	operations as incurred. During the three months ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016, the Company incurred $95,814 and $95,237 of expenses
	related to research and development costs,
	respectively.

	Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share




	 




	The
	Company computes earnings per share under ASC Subtopic 260-10,
	Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”). Basic earnings
	(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss)
	attributable to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the
	weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the
	denominator) during the reporting periods. Diluted loss per
	share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted
	average number of additional shares that could have been
	outstanding from securities convertible into common stock (using
	the “treasury stock” method), unless their effect on
	net loss per share is anti-dilutive. There were 1,526,005 and
	1,346,441 potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding
	common stock options, warrants, and convertible notes, as of March
	31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.




	 




	The
	potential shares, which are excluded from the determination of
	basic and diluted net loss per share as their effect is
	anti-dilutive, are as follows:

	Fair Value Measurements




	 




	Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments require
	disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized
	in our balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that
	value. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amounts
	reported for cash, accrued liabilities and accrued interest
	approximated fair value because of their short
	maturities.




	 




	In accordance with ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements
	and Disclosures,” we measure certain financial instruments at
	fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value,
	established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and
	expands disclosures about fair value measurements.




	 




	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell
	an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820
	established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes
	the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the
	highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
	identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the
	lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
	These tiers include:




	 








	 






	●






	Level
	1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical
	instruments in active markets;








	 






	 






	 








	 






	●






	Level
	2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
	that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted
	prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices
	for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
	active; and








	 






	 






	 








	 






	●






	Level
	3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data
	exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
	assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques
	in which one or more significant inputs or significant value
	drivers are unobservable.

	Share-based Compensation




	 




	The
	Company’s 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has been
	approved by its board of directors, permits the grant of share
	options and shares to its employees, consultants and non-employee
	members of the board of directors for up to 1,345,074 shares of
	common stock, of which approximately 500,000 remain available to be
	granted. The Company records share-based compensation in accordance
	with the provisions of the Share-based Compensation Topic of the
	FASB Codification. The guidance requires the use of option-pricing
	models that require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
	including the option’s expected life and the price volatility
	of the underlying stock. The fair value of each option grant is
	estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
	valuation model, and the resulting charge is expensed using the
	straight-line attribution method over the vesting period. The
	Company has elected to use the calculated value method to account
	for the options it issued in 2017 and 2016. A nonpublic entity that
	is unable to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its
	underlying share may measure awards based on a “calculated
	value,” which substitutes the volatility of appropriate
	public companies (representative of the company’s size and
	industry) as a bench mark for the volatility of the entity’s
	own share price. Currently, there is no active market for the
	Company’s common shares. The Company has used the historical
	closing values of these companies to estimate volatility, which was
	calculated to be 90%.




	 




	Stock
	compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the
	value of share-based awards that were expected to vest during the
	period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The estimated fair value
	of grants of stock options and warrants to non-employees of the
	Company is charged to expense, if applicable, in the financial
	statements. These options vest in the same manner as the employee
	options granted under each of the option plans as described
	above.




	 




	Beneficial Conversion Feature




	 




	If the
	conversion feature of conventional convertible debt provides for a
	rate of conversion that is below market value, this feature is
	characterized as a beneficial conversion feature
	(“BCF”). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt
	discount pursuant to ASC Topic 470-20 “Debt with Conversion
	and Other Options.” In those circumstances, the convertible
	debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF and the
	Company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of
	the debt using the effective interest method.




	 




	Debt Discount




	 




	The
	Company determines if the convertible debenture should be accounted
	for as liability or equity under ASC 480, Liabilities —
	Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. ASC 480 applies to certain
	contracts involving a company’s own equity, and requires that
	issuers classify the following freestanding financial instruments
	as liabilities. Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments,
	obligations that require or may require repurchase of the
	issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets (e.g., written
	put options and forward purchase contracts), and certain
	obligations where at inception the monetary value of the obligation
	is based solely or predominantly on:




	 








	●






	A fixed
	monetary amount known at inception, for example, a payable
	settleable with a variable number of the issuer’s equity
	shares with an issuance date fair value equal to a fixed dollar
	amount;

	 









	 








	●






	Variations
	in something other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity
	shares, for example, a financial instrument indexed to the S&P
	500 and settleable with a variable number of the issuer’s
	equity shares; or

	 

	 








	 








	●






	Variations
	inversely related to changes in the fair value of the
	issuer’s equity shares, for example, a written put that could
	be net share settled.

	 

	If the entity
	determined the instrument meets the guidance under ASC 480 the
	instrument is accounted for as a liability with a respective debt
	discount. The Company records debt discounts in connection with
	raising funds through the issuance of promissory notes (see Note
	6). These costs are amortized to noncash interest expense over the
	life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a
	proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately
	expensed.

	Going Concern




	 




	The
	Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP")
	applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
	business. The Company has a limited operating history and had a
	cumulative net loss from inception to March 31, 2017 of
	$13,260,096. The Company has a working capital deficit of
	$1,659,184 as of March 31, 2017. The Company has not yet
	established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its
	operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The
	accompanying financial statements for the period ended March 31,
	2017, have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a
	going concern. The Company believes its cash resources are
	insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve
	months. The Company will require additional financing to fund its
	future planned operations, including research and development and
	commercialization of its products.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
	on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses
	until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable.
	Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include
	raising additional capital through sales of equity securities and
	borrowing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that
	the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
	If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional
	financing on a timely basis, the Company will be forced to delay or
	scale down some or all of its development activities or perhaps
	even cease the operation of its business.  The ability of the
	Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its
	ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and
	attain profitable operations. There is substantial doubt about the
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern within one
	year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
	going concern.




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	In May
	2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
	Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue
	recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
	revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it
	with a principle based approach for determining revenue
	recognition. Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when a
	customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is
	recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the
	entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
	In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,
	amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
	from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued ASU
	2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, ASU 2016-12, and ASU 2016-20,
	all of which clarify certain implementation guidance within ASU
	2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only
	in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
	including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted
	either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented
	(full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative
	effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of
	initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method).
	The Company is currently in the process of analyzing the
	information necessary to determine the impact of adopting this new
	guidance on its financial position, results of operations, and cash
	flows. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of this statement
	in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02
	requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a
	corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases
	with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all
	interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective
	transition approach is required for lessees for capital and
	operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
	of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. The
	Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the
	standard could have on its financial statements and related
	disclosures.




	 




	Other
	recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its
	Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
	Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did
	not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
	the Company’s present or future financial
	statements.

	On
	January 28, 2016, the Company entered into promissory notes with
	three investors for a total amount of $50,000.  The notes
	matured one year from the issue date, accrue no interest and are
	payable at maturity. The Company accounted for imputed interest of
	$986 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was
	calculated at a rate of 8% per annum, consistent with other notes
	issued by the Company. During the period ending March 31, 2017 the
	Company and the promissory note holders agreed to extend the
	maturity date of all three notes to July 31, 2017, on the same
	terms as previously agreed. Subsequent to the period ended March
	31, 2017, the promissory notes were repaid in full to all
	holders.




	 




	During
	2016, the Company entered into convertible promissory notes with
	approximately 60 investors for a total principal amount of
	$1,386,448, $132,000 of which were purchased by related parties
	(the “2016 Notes”).   On March 15, 2017, the
	Company extended the 2016 Notes offering by $250,000. The extension
	was made available only to existing noteholders and obtained
	subscriptions for $225,000. Pursuant to the terms of the 2016
	Notes, noteholders holding a majority of the outstanding principal
	amount of the 2016 Notes elected to convert the principal and
	accrued interest on all outstanding 2016 Notes into shares of the
	Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $1.40 per
	share immediately prior to the Company’s initial public
	offering. 1,232,859 shares of the Company’s common stock were
	issued upon such conversion (see Note 9). In connection with the
	issuance of the 2016 Notes, the Company recorded a debt discount at
	an initial aggregate value of $1,611,448, of which $351,727 was
	amortized during the three months ended March 31, 2017, resulting
	in a debt discount balance of $359,745 as of March 31,
	2017.

	The
	Company accrued interest expense of $28,138 for the period ended
	March 31, 2017, $2,604 of which was payable for the notes due to
	related parties.




	 




	Note 6 – Capital Stock




	 




	At
	March 31, 2017, the authorized capital of the Company consisted of
	60,000,000

	 

	shares of
	capital stock, consisting of 50,000,000 shares of common stock with
	a par value of $0.0001

	 

	per share, and 10,000,000 shares
	of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001

	 

	per share.




	 




	There
	was $9,000 of stock to be issued during the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 for services. There was $90,000 of stock payable as
	of March 31, 2017.




	 




	As of
	March 31, 2017, there were 732,335 shares of common stock issued

	Note 8 – Commitments & Contingencies




	 




	From time to time the Company may become a party to litigation in
	the normal course of business. Management believes that there are
	no current legal matters that would have a material effect on the
	Company’s financial position or results of
	operations.




	 




	On
	November 11, 2007, the Company entered into an at-will employment
	agreement with its Chief Operating Officer (now its Chief
	Technology Officer). The employment agreement required annual base
	salary payments of $200,000 per year, with a bonus potential of 20%
	of the then current base salary. In addition, the executive was
	granted an option to purchase 29,429 shares of Company's common
	stock exercisable at $10.01 per share, vesting in 3 equal annual
	installments on each anniversary of its three year term. The
	agreement also provided for severance compensation if terminated
	other than for cause (as defined therein) of 6 months of the then
	applicable base salary if the COO had been employed at least 6
	months, and compensation equal to 12 months of the then applicable
	base salary if employed over 12 months.




	 




	Effective
	May 12, 2017, the Company and its Chief Technology Officer entered
	into a new employment agreement (see Note 9).




	 




	On
	August 28, 2014, the Company entered into a services agreement with
	StoryCorp Consulting dba Wells Compliance Group ("StoryCorp") for
	financial reporting and compliance services. David R. Wells is the
	owner of this firm and is the Company’s Chief Financial
	Officer. The services agreement called for monthly payments of
	$5,000, and accrued an additional $3,000 per month in fees to be
	paid by common stock at the time of a public offering. The accrued
	balance due under the cash portion as of March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016 was $15,000 and $25,000 respectively, and the
	accrued balance due under the stock portion was $90,000 and
	$81,000, respectively.




	 




	Effective
	May 12, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with
	StoryCorp Consulting that superseded the services agreement (see
	Note 9).




	 




	Effective
	January 1, 2015, we entered into an office lease agreement with
	Green Court, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, for
	approximately 3,657 rentable square feet of space, for the initial
	monthly rent of $5,986, which commenced on January 1, 2015 for an
	initial term of 60 months. Under the terms of the lease the Company
	has an option on the same space for an additional 60-month term.
	Future minimum payments under this lease are as
	follows:

	For the
	three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company
	incurred rent expense of $18,968 and $18,165,
	respectively.




	 




	On
	April 16, 2015, the Company entered into an at-will employment
	agreement with its Chief Executive Officer. The employment
	agreement required annual base salary payments of $250,000 per year
	with a bonus potential of 50% of the then current base salary. In
	addition, the executive was granted an option to purchase 35,499
	shares of Company's common stock exercisable at $10.01 per share,
	vesting in 3 equal annual installments on each anniversary of its
	three year term. The agreement also provided for severance
	compensation if terminated other than for cause (as defined
	therein) of 6 months of the then applicable base salary if the CEO
	has been employed at least 6 months, and compensation equal to 12
	months of the then applicable base salary if employed over 12
	months.




	 




	Effective
	May 12, 2017, the Company and its Chief Executive Officer entered
	into a new employment agreement (see Note 9).

	Note 9 – Subsequent Events




	 




	Reverse Stock Split




	 




	On May
	8, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the
	“Certificate of Amendment”) to its certificate of
	incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
	to effect a one-for-3.5 reverse stock split (the “Reverse
	Split”) of the Company’s common stock, with no
	reduction in authorized capital stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
	Certificate of Amendment, the Reverse Split became effective at
	11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2017. In the Reverse Split, every
	3.5 outstanding shares of common stock became one share of common
	stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the
	Reverse Split. Subject to the terms of the Certificate of
	Amendment, stockholders who were otherwise entitled to receive a
	fractional share of common stock received one whole share of common
	stock.




	 




	The
	Reverse Split was previously approved by holders of a majority of
	the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. All common
	stock and stock incentive plan information in these financial
	statements has been restated to reflect this split.




	 




	Conversion of Convertible Notes




	 




	In
	connection with the funding of the Company’s initial public
	offering of its units (the “IPO”), on May 12, 2017, the
	principal and interest due under the Company’s convertible
	notes, in an aggregate amount of $1,726,079, was converted into
	1,232,859 shares of the Company’s common stock. The
	purchasers of the convertible notes are subject to lock-up
	requirements with respect to the conversion shares for periods that
	expire on May 9, 2018.




	 




	Initial Public Offering of Units




	 




	The
	Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended
	(Reg. No. 333-214724), was declared effective by the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 8, 2017, and the
	Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Reg. No.
	333-217788), which was filed on May 8, 2017 with the SEC pursuant
	to Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	“Securities Act”), became effective upon filing. These
	registration statements registered the securities offered in the
	IPO. In the IPO, the Company sold 1,932,000 units at a price to the
	public of $5.00 per unit, including the full exercise of the
	underwriters’ option to purchase additional units. The IPO
	closed on May 12, 2017 and the underwriters exercised their
	overallotment option as of May 22, 2017, as a result of which the
	Company raised net proceeds of approximately $8.6 million after
	deducting approximately $773,000 in underwriting discounts,
	commissions and expenses and approximately $297,000 in offering
	expenses payable by the Company. National Securities Corporation
	and Dougherty & Company LLC were the underwriters of the IPO.
	No payments were made by the Company to its directors or officers
	or persons owning ten percent or more of its common stock or to
	their associates, or to the Company’s affiliates, other than
	payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for
	salaries and to non-employee directors as compensation for board or
	board committee service.




	 




	IPO Underwriters’ Warrants




	 




	In
	connection with the closing of the IPO, the Company issued to the
	underwriters and their designees warrants to purchase an aggregate
	of 154,560 shares of the Company’s common stock (the
	“Underwriters’ Warrants”) at an exercise price of
	$6.25 per share with an expiration date of May 8, 2022. The
	Underwriters’ Warrants become exercisable on November 8,
	2017.




	 




	Employment and Consulting Agreements




	 




	Effective
	as of May 12, 2017 upon the closing of the IPO, the Company entered
	into amended and restated employment agreements with Francois
	Michelon, its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of its Board of
	Directors, and Michael Thornton, its Chief Technology Officer. Mr.
	Michelon’s employment agreement provides for an annual base
	salary of $325,000 and eligibility for an annual cash bonus up to a
	percentage of such base salary (in 2016, up to 35% of his base
	salary then in effect). Mr. Thornton’s employment agreement
	provides for an annual base salary of $245,000 and eligibility for
	an annual cash bonus up to a percentage of such base salary (in
	2016, up to 22% of his base salary then in effect). The employment
	agreements also provide for eligibility to receive benefits
	substantially similar to those of the Company’s other senior
	executive officers.




	 






	 




	12










	 






	 




	Pursuant
	to the employment agreements, Mr. Michelon and Mr. Thornton were
	each granted stock options to purchase a number of shares of the
	Company’s common stock, that, taken together with the number
	of shares such officer already held, equal 5.0% of the
	Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock
	on a fully diluted basis following the IPO and underwriters’
	exercise of their overallotment option. The stock options have a
	weighted average exercise price of approximately $4.96, and vest in
	three equal annual installments beginning on May 12,
	2019.




	 




	Effective
	as of May 12, 2017, the Company entered into a consulting agreement
	with StoryCorp, pursuant to which David Wells will continue to
	provide services to the Company as its Chief Financial Officer.
	Pursuant to the consulting agreement, the Company will pay to
	StoryCorp a monthly fee of $9,000. Additionally, pursuant to the
	consulting agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Wells a stock
	option to purchase 15,000 shares of common stock in connection with
	the closing of the IPO, having an exercise price per share equal to
	$5.00 (the price per unit to the public in the IPO) and vesting in
	twelve equal quarterly installments, and will grant to Mr. Wells a
	stock option to purchase the same number of shares of common stock
	with the same terms on each annual anniversary of the date of the
	consulting agreement. The consulting agreement supersedes the
	consulting agreement previously in effect between the Company and
	StoryCorp.

	anagement’s Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations




	 




	Forward-Looking Statements




	 




	As used
	in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form
	10-Q”), unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
	“we,” “us,” “our,”
	“ENDRA” and the "Company" refer to ENDRA Life Sciences
	Inc., a Delaware corporation. The following discussion and analysis
	of our financial condition and results of operations should be read
	in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related
	notes thereto in this Form 10-Q. This Form 10-Q contains
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to
	be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those
	sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain
	assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and
	expectations, can generally be identified by the use of
	forward-looking terms such as “believe,”
	“expect,” “may,” “will,”
	“should,” “could,” “seek,”
	“intend,” “plan,” “estimate,”
	“anticipate” or other comparable terms. All statements
	other than statements of historical facts included in this Form
	10-Q regarding our strategies, prospects, financial condition,
	operations, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking
	statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among
	others, statements we make regarding expectations for revenues,
	cash flows and financial performance, the anticipated results of
	our development efforts and the timing for receipt of required
	regulatory approvals and product launches. Forward-looking
	statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future
	performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs,
	expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business,
	future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and
	trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because
	forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject
	to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that
	are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our
	control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ
	materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
	Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking
	statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results
	and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated
	in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the
	following: our ability to develop a commercially feasible
	technology; receipt of necessary regulatory approvals; our ability
	to find and maintain development partners, market acceptance of our
	technology, the amount and nature of competition in our industry;
	our ability to protect our intellectual property; and the other
	risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors and in
	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations sections of this Form 10-Q. We undertake
	no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement,
	whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time,
	whether as a result of new information, future developments or
	otherwise.




	 




	Overview




	 




	We have
	commercialized an enhanced ultrasound technology for the
	pre-clinical research market and are leveraging that expertise to
	develop technology for increasing the capabilities of clinical
	diagnostic ultrasound, to broaden patient access to the safe
	diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical
	conditions in circumstances where expensive X-ray computed
	tomography (“CT”) and magnetic resonance imaging
	(“MRI”) technology is unavailable or
	impractical.




	 




	Since
	2010, we have marketed and sold our Nexus 128 system, which
	combines light-based thermoacoustics and ultrasound, to address the
	imaging needs of researchers studying disease models in
	pre-clinical applications. Sales of the Nexus 128 system were
	approximately $1.4 million in 2015 and $515,000 in 2016. Our Nexus
	128 system is used in a number of leading global academic research
	centers, including Stanford University, The University of Michigan,
	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Purdue University. We expect to
	continue to sell our Nexus 128 system to maintain a base level of
	revenue, but believe the market potential for our clinical systems
	is much higher.




	 




	Building
	on our expertise in thermoacoustics, we developed a next-generation
	technology platform — Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound, or
	TAEUS — which is intended to enhance the capability of
	clinical ultrasound technology and support the diagnosis and
	treatment of a number of significant medical conditions that
	currently require the use of expensive CT or MRI imaging or where
	imaging is not practical using existing technology.




	 




	Unlike
	the near-infrared light pulses used in our Nexus 128 system, our
	TAEUS technology uses radio frequency (“RF”) pulses to
	stimulate tissues, using a small fraction of the energy transmitted
	into the body during an MRI scan. The use of RF energy allows our
	TAEUS technology to penetrate deep into tissue, enabling the
	imaging of human anatomy at depths equivalent to those of
	conventional ultrasound. The RF pulses are absorbed by tissue and
	converted into ultrasound signals, which are detected by an
	external ultrasound receiver and a digital acquisition system that
	is part of the TAEUS system. The detected ultrasound is processed
	into images using our proprietary algorithms and overlaid in real
	time onto conventional gray-scale ultrasound images.




	 




	We
	expect that the first-generation TAEUS application will be a
	standalone ultrasound accessory designed to cost-effectively
	quantify fat in the liver and stage progression of non-alcoholic
	fatty liver disease, or ("NAFLD"), which can only be achieved today
	with impractical surgical biopsies or MRI scans. Subsequent TAEUS
	offerings are expected to be implemented via a second generation
	hardware platform that can run multiple clinical software
	applications that we will offer TAEUS users for a one-time
	licensing fee – adding ongoing customer value to the TAEUS
	platform and a growing software revenue stream for our
	Company.




	 






	 




	14










	 






	 




	Each of
	our TAEUS platform applications will require regulatory approvals
	before we are able to sell or license the application. Based on
	certain factors, such as the installed base of ultrasound systems,
	availability of other imaging technologies, such as CT and MRI,
	economic strength and applicable regulatory requirements, we intend
	to seek initial approval of our applications for sale in the
	European Union, followed by the United States and
	China.




	 




	Financial Operations Overview




	 




	Revenue




	 




	To date
	our revenue has been generated by the placement and sale of our
	Nexus 128 system for use in pre-clinical applications.




	 




	Cost of Goods Sold




	 




	Our
	cost of goods sold is related to our direct costs associated with
	the development and shipment of our thermoacoustic imaging systems
	placed in pre-clinical settings.




	 




	Research and Development Expenses




	 




	Our
	research and development expenses primarily include wages, fees and
	equipment for the development of our TAEUS technology platform and
	our proposed applications. Additionally, we incur certain costs
	associated with the protection of our products and inventions
	through a combination of patents, licenses, applications and
	disclosures.




	 




	Sales and Marketing Expenses




	 




	Sales
	and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising, marketing
	and consulting expenses and headcount. Currently, our marketing
	efforts for our pre-clinical business are through distributors in
	China, the European Union, Australia, Korea and the United Kingdom,
	our website, and attendance of key industry meetings. In connection
	with the commercialization of our TAEUS applications, we expect to
	build a small sales and marketing team to train and support global
	ultrasound distributors, as well as execute traditional marketing
	activities such as promotional materials, electronic media and
	participation in industry conferences.




	 




	General and Administrative Expenses




	 




	General
	and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and
	related expenses for our management and personnel, and professional
	fees, such as accounting, consulting and legal.




	 






	 




	15










	 






	 




	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	 




	Use of Estimates




	 




	The
	preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
	contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 




	Management
	makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred
	income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity
	instruments and reserves for any other commitments or
	contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized
	in the period in which such adjustments are
	determined.




	 




	Share-based Compensation




	 




	Our
	2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan which has been approved by our board of
	directors, permits the grant of share options and shares to our
	employees, consultants and non-employee members of our board of
	directors for up to 1,345,074 shares of common stock. We record
	share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the
	Share-based Compensation Topic of the FASB Codification. The
	guidance requires the use of option-pricing models that require the
	input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
	option’s expected life and the price volatility of the
	underlying stock. The fair value of each option grant is estimated
	on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model
	which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates,
	expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and
	future dividends, and the resulting charge is expensed using the
	straight-line attribution method over the vesting
	period.




	 




	Stock
	compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the
	value of share-based awards that were expected to vest during the
	period adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The estimated fair value
	of grants of stock options and warrants to non-employees is charged
	to expense, if applicable, in the financial
	statements.

	Note 2 of the financial statements for a discussion of recently
	issued accounting standards.




	 




	Results of Operations




	 




	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016




	 




	Revenues




	 




	We had
	no revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31,
	2016.




	 






	 




	16










	 






	 




	Research and Development




	 




	Research
	and development expenses were $95,814 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017, as compared to $95,237 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, an increase of $577, or 1%. The costs include
	primary wages, fees and equipment for the development of our TAEUS
	product line. Research and development expenses were unchanged from
	the same period for the prior year and consisted mostly of wages
	and employment related expenses.




	 




	Sales and Marketing




	 




	Sales
	and marketing expenses were $1,124 for the three months ended March
	31, 2017, as compared to $4,433 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016, a decrease of $3,309, or 75%. The decrease was primarily
	due to reduced commissions paid on the sale of our Nexus 128
	system. Currently our marketing efforts for our pre-clinical
	business are through distributors in China, the European Union,
	Australia and the United Kingdom, our website and attendance of key
	industry meetings. Our future clinical business will involve hiring
	and training additional staff to support our sales efforts. As we
	seek to complete the development and commercialization of our TAEUS
	applications, we intend to build a small sales and marketing team
	to train and support global ultrasound distributors, as well as
	execute traditional marketing activities such as promotional
	materials, electronic media and participation in industry
	conferences.




	 




	General and Administrative




	 




	Our
	general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 were $263,760, a decrease of $10,026, or 4%,
	compared to $273,786 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
	General and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in
	headcount, offset by one-time expenses related to the IPO.
	Our

	 

	wage and related
	expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $126,766,
	compared to $159,400 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
	Wage and related expenses in the three month period ended March 31,
	2017 included $20,697 of stock compensation expense related to the
	issuance and vesting of options, compared to $69,240 of stock
	compensation expense for 2016. Our professional fees for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 were $72,472, compared to $56,425 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016. We expect that our general
	and administrative expenses will increase significantly as a result
	of our becoming a public company.




	 




	Net loss




	 




	As a
	result of the foregoing, for the three months ended March 31, 2017,
	we recorded a net loss of $741,623 compared to a net loss of
	$379,478 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	To
	date, we have generated only limited revenues from sales of our
	Nexus 128 system. We have funded our operations to date through
	private and public sales of our securities. As of March 31, 2017,
	we had $133,679 in cash. In May 2017, we completed our initial
	public offering (the “IPO”), raising net proceeds of
	approximately $8.6 million after deducting offering expenses of
	approximately $773,000 in underwriting discounts, commissions and
	expenses and approximately $297,000 in offering expenses payable by
	the Company.




	 




	The
	financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared
	assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
	liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As
	reflected in the accompanying financial statements, during the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred a net loss
	of $741,623 used cash in operations of $236,274, and at March 31,
	2017, the Company had a stockholders’ deficit of $1,379,706.
	These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year
	from the issuance of the financial statements. The financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
	should the Company be unable to continue as a going
	concern.




	 




	Operating Activities




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company used $53,757 of
	cash in operating activities primarily as a result of its net loss
	of $379,478, offset in part by net changes in operating assets and
	liabilities of $225,477, $16,181 in depreciation and amortization
	expense, $78,240 in non-cash stock compensation expense, and
	additional warrants issued during the warrant exchange program of
	$5,823.

	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company used $236,274 of
	cash in operating activities primarily as a result of its net loss
	of $741,623, offset by amortization of discount of convertible debt
	of $351,727, share-based compensation of $29,697, $15,690 in
	depreciation and amortization expenses, and net changes in
	operating assets and liabilities of $107,247.




	 




	Investing Activities




	 




	There
	were no investing activities for the three months ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016.




	 




	Financing Activities




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, financing activities
	provided $55,000, including $5,000 from common stock issued for
	cash, and $50,000 in proceeds from notes payable.




	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, financing activities
	provided $225,000 in proceeds from issuance of convertible
	notes.




	 




	Funding Requirements




	 




	We have
	not completed development of our TAEUS technology platform
	applications. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses
	for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will
	increase substantially as we:




	 






	●




	advance the
	engineering design and development of our NAFLD TAEUS
	application;






	 






	●




	prepare
	applications required for marketing approval of our NAFLD TAEUS
	application in the European Union and the United
	States;






	 






	●




	seek to hire a
	small internal marketing team to engage and support channel
	partners and clinical customers for our NAFLD TAEUS
	application;






	 






	●




	commence marketing
	of our NAFLD TAEUS application;






	 






	●




	advance development
	of our other TAEUS applications; and






	 






	●




	add operational,
	financial and management information systems and personnel,
	including personnel to support our product development, planned
	commercialization efforts and our operation as a public
	company.






	 




	We
	believe that our existing cash, taking into account the net
	proceeds of our IPO, will be sufficient for us to fund the
	development and regulatory approval and to prepare for the
	commercialization of our NAFLD TAEUS application in the European
	Union. It is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we
	expect because the actual costs and timing of completing the
	development and regulatory approvals for a new medical device are
	difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and
	delays. We have no committed external sources of funds. We do not
	expect that our existing cash will be sufficient for us to complete
	the commercialization of our NAFLD TAEUS application or to complete
	the development of any other TAEUS application and we will need to
	raise substantial additional capital for those purposes. As a
	result, we will need to finance our future cash needs through
	public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate
	collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing
	alternatives. Our forecast of the period of time through which our
	financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a
	forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and
	actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors,
	including the factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk
	Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We have based this
	estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could
	utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently
	expect.




	 




	Until
	we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our TAEUS
	platform applications, if ever, we expect to finance future cash
	needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings
	or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. Additional
	funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are
	acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available,
	we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one
	or more of our research or development programs or our
	commercialization efforts. To the extent that we raise additional
	funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience
	additional dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve
	restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds
	through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be
	necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or
	applications or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable
	to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets
	whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an
	immediate need for additional capital at that time.

	Disclosure About Market Risk

	issuers that satisfy the definition of “smaller reporting
	company” under Securities and Exchange Commission
	rules.





	 











	Item 4.

	ontrols and
	Procedures




	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 




	As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, management
	performed, with the participation of our principal executive
	officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the
	effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
	in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act
	of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our
	disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or
	submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
	and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
	and Exchange Commission’s forms, and that such information is
	accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
	principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to
	allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on the
	evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
	officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure
	controls and procedures were not effective.




	 




	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
	deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
	that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
	of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis. We identified the following material
	weakness as of March 31, 2017: insufficient personnel resources
	within the accounting function to segregate the duties over
	financial transaction processing and reporting.




	 




	To remediate our internal control weaknesses, management intends to
	implement the following measures, as finances allow:




	 






	●




	We will add
	sufficient accounting personnel or outside consultants to properly
	segregate duties and to effect a timely, accurate preparation of
	the financial statements.








	●




	Upon the hiring of
	additional accounting personnel or outside consultants, we will
	develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and
	procedures.






	 




	The
	additional hiring is contingent upon our efforts to obtain
	additional funding and the results of our operations. Management
	expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no
	assurances that it will be able to do so.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	There
	was no change to our internal controls or in other factors that
	could affect these controls during the three month period ended
	March 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting. However, our management is currently seeking resolutions
	to improve our controls and procedures in an effort to remediate
	the deficiency described above.

	PART II
	– OTHER INFORMATION




	 








	Item
	1. 


	Legal
	Proceedings




	 




	We are
	not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we
	believe will have a material adverse effect on our business or
	financial conditions. We may, however, be subject to various claims
	and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from
	time to time.





	 











	Item 1A. 

	R

	isk Factors




	 




	Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You
	should carefully consider the following risks and all other
	information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
	including our financial statements and the related notes, before
	investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described
	below supplement, or to the extent inconsistent, supersede those
	disclosed in our final Prospectus for our initial public offering
	as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 10,
	2017. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only
	ones we face, but include the most significant factors currently
	known by us that make investing in our securities speculative or
	risky. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of,
	or that we currently believe are not material, also may become
	important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks
	materialize, our business, financial condition and results of
	operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the trading
	price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or
	all of your investment.




	 




	Risks Related to Our Business




	 




	We have a history of operating losses, and we may never achieve or
	maintain profitability.




	 




	We have a limited operating history upon which investors may
	evaluate our prospects. We have only generated limited revenues to
	date and have a history of losses from operations. As of March 31,
	2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1,379,706. We
	will require additional capital to complete the commercialization
	of our planned TAEUS applications and to meet our growth and
	profitability targets. We expect to expend significant resources on
	hiring of personnel, payroll and benefits, continued scientific and
	potential product research and development, potential product
	testing and pre-clinical and clinical investigations, intellectual
	property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion,
	capital expenditures, working capital, and general and
	administrative expenses. We also expect to incur costs and expenses
	related to consulting, laboratory development, hiring of scientists
	and other operational personnel, and expenses associated with the
	development of relationships with strategic partners.




	 




	Our Thermo Acoustic Enhanced Ultrasound, or ("TAEUS"), technology
	is still in development and we do not have any applications for our
	TAEUS technology approved for sale. Applications for our TAEUS
	technology may never be approved, generate significant revenue or
	become commercially viable. Our ability to generate significant
	revenues and, ultimately, achieve profitability will depend on
	whether we can obtain additional capital when we need it, complete
	the development of our technology, receive required regulatory
	approvals for our TAEUS applications and find customers who will
	purchase our future products or strategic partners that will
	incorporate our technology into their products. Even if we develop
	commercially viable applications for our TAEUS technology, which
	may include licensing, we may never recover our research and
	development expenses and we may never be able to produce material
	revenues or operate on a profitable basis.




	 





	Our efforts may never result in the successful development of
	commercial applications


	 


	based on
	our TAEUS technology.





	 




	Due to the limited tissue penetration capability of light-based
	thermoacoustic technology, we believe that there is a limited
	clinical market for our current Nexus 128 product, which is focused
	on laboratory specimen analysis. As a result, we are currently
	focused on the development of products based on our TAEUS
	technology. We have not yet completed the development of any
	applications based on such technology. Our research and development
	efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the
	development of new products based on emerging technologies,
	including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other
	problems, the inability to develop a product that may be sold at an
	acceptable price point and the possible insufficiency of funds
	needed in order to complete development of these products.
	Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur
	additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot
	complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing
	applications based on, our TAEUS technology, particularly after
	incurring significant expenditures, our business may
	fail.




	 






	 




	20










	 






	 




	Our success is substantially dependent on the success of
	applications for our TAEUS platform.




	 




	To date we have generated only limited sales of our existing Nexus
	128 product and our ability to generate meaningful revenues in the
	future will depend on the successful development and
	commercialization of our TAEUS platform applications. The
	commercial success of our TAEUS platform applications and our
	ability to generate revenues will depend on many factors, including
	the following:




	 






	●




	our
	successful development of applications for our TAEUS technology,
	such as those we intend to pursue for the diagnosis of Non-Alcohol
	Fatty Liver Disease, or ("NAFLD"), and the monitoring of thermal
	ablation surgery, and the acceptance in the marketplace by
	physicians and patients of such applications;






	 






	●




	the
	successful design and manufacturing of a device or devices which
	enable the use of our TAEUS technology by physicians on their
	patients;






	 






	●




	receipt
	of necessary regulatory approvals;






	 






	●




	sufficient
	coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors;






	 






	●




	our
	ability to successfully market our products;






	 






	●




	our
	ability to demonstrate that our TAEUS applications have
	advantages over competing products and procedures;






	 






	●




	the
	amount and nature of competition from competing or alternative
	imaging products; and






	 






	●




	our
	ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing,
	distribution and sales force capabilities.






	 




	We have limited data regarding the efficacy of our TAEUS platform
	applications. If our applications do not perform in accordance with
	our expectations, we are unlikely to successfully commercialize our
	applications, even if they receive regulatory
	approval.




	 




	Our success depends in large part on the medical and third-party
	payor community’s acceptance of our TAEUS applications. As a
	result, even if we receive regulatory approval for our
	applications, we believe that we will need to obtain additional
	clinical data from users of our applications to persuade medical
	professions to use our applications. We may conduct post-approval
	clinical testing to obtain such additional data. Clinical testing
	is expensive, can take a significant amount of time to complete and
	can have uncertain outcomes. We have not yet conducted any clinical
	studies and there can be no assurance that the results of any such
	studies will be positive. Our failure to conduct successful
	clinical studies could have a material, adverse impact on our
	business.




	 




	Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our
	business, predict our future results or forecast our financial
	performance and growth.




	 




	We were incorporated in 2007 and began commercializing our initial
	pre-clinical Nexus 128 product in 2010. Our limited operating
	history makes it difficult to evaluate our business, predict our
	future results or forecast our financial performance and growth. If
	our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face,
	which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to
	circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not
	address these risks successfully, our operating and financial
	results could differ materially from our expectations and our
	business could suffer.




	 






	 




	21










	 






	 




	We may not remain commercially viable if there is an inadequate
	level of reimbursement by governmental programs and other
	third-party payors.




	 





	Medical imaging products are purchased principally by hospitals,
	physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that
	typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental
	programs (


	e.g.


	, Medicare and Medicaid in the United States),
	private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the services
	provided to their patients.





	 




	Third-party payors and governments may approve or deny coverage for
	certain technologies and associated procedures based on
	independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement
	decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of
	methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed
	resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These
	reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different, and
	sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to
	healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies and
	decisions are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors
	are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates, often
	downwards, indirectly challenging the prices charged for medical
	products and services. There can be no assurance that our products
	will be covered by third-party payors, that adequate reimbursement
	will be available or, even if payment is available, that
	third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely
	affect our ability to sell our products profitably.




	 




	We will depend on third parties to design, manufacture and seek
	regulatory approval of our TAEUS applications. If any third party
	fails to successfully design, manufacture and gain regulatory
	approval of our TAEUS applications, our business will be materially
	harmed.




	 




	We currently intend to outsource the design and manufacturing of
	applications utilizing our TAEUS technology rather than manufacture
	our TAEUS applications ourselves. We will have limited control over
	the efforts and resources that any third-party original equipment
	manufacturer ("OEM"), will devote to developing and manufacturing
	our TAEUS applications. In addition, we currently expect to depend
	on OEMs to acquire CE marks for the device or devices that they
	develop and manufacture which are necessary to permit marketing of
	those devices in the European Union.




	 




	An OEM may not be able to successfully design and manufacture the
	products it develops based on our TAEUS technology, may not devote
	sufficient time and resources to support these efforts or may fail
	in gaining the required regulatory approvals of our TAEUS
	applications. The failure by an OEM in its efforts to design,
	manufacture or gain regulatory approval of our TAEUS applications
	could substantially harm the value of our TAEUS technology, brand
	and business.




	 




	If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business,
	our future revenues and operating results may be
	harmed.




	 




	Because of our small size, growth in accordance with our business
	plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our
	financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we
	expand our activities, there will be additional demands on these
	resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical,
	administrative, operating and financial control systems or the
	occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including issues
	relating to our research and development activities and retention
	of experienced scientists, managers and technicians, could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
	results of operations and our ability to timely execute our
	business plan. If we are unable to implement these actions in a
	timely manner, our results may be adversely affected.




	 




	Competition in the medical imaging market is intense and we may be
	unable to successfully compete.




	 




	In general, competition in the medical imaging market is very
	significant and characterized by extensive research and development
	and rapid technological change. Competitors in this market include
	very large companies with significantly greater resources than we
	have. To successfully compete in this market we will need to
	develop TAEUS applications for particular applications that offer
	significant advantages over alternative imaging products and
	procedures for such applications.




	 




	Developments by other medical imaging companies of new or improved
	products, processes or technologies may make our products or
	proposed products obsolete or less competitive. Alternative medical
	imaging devices may be more accepted or cost-effective than our
	products. Competition from these companies for employees with
	experience in the medical imaging industry could result in higher
	turnover of our employees. If we are unable to respond to these
	competitive pressures, we could experience delayed or reduced
	market acceptance of our products, higher expenses and lower
	revenue. If we are unable to compete effectively with current or
	new entrants to these markets, we will be unable to generate
	sufficient revenue to maintain our business.




	 






	 




	22










	 






	 




	Changes in the healthcare industry could result in a reduction in
	the size of the market for our products or may require us to
	decrease the selling price for our products, either of which could
	have a negative impact on our financial performance.




	 




	Trends toward managed care, healthcare cost containment, and other
	changes in government and private sector initiatives in Europe, the
	United States and China are placing increased emphasis on lowering
	the cost of medical services, which could adversely affect the
	demand for or the prices of our products. For example:




	 






	●




	major
	third-party payors of hospital and non-hospital based healthcare
	services could revise their payment methodologies and impose
	stricter standards for reimbursement of imaging procedures charges
	and/or a lower or more bundled reimbursement;






	 






	●




	there
	has been a consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers
	of medical devices who prefer to limit the number of suppliers from
	whom they purchase medical products, and these entities may decide
	to stop purchasing our products or demand discounts on our
	prices;






	 






	●




	there
	is economic pressure to contain healthcare costs in markets
	throughout the world; and






	 






	●




	there
	are proposed and existing laws and regulations in international and
	domestic markets regulating pricing and profitability of companies
	in the healthcare industry.






	 




	These trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our
	products and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products
	in any given market that could adversely affect our revenue and
	profitability, which could harm our business.




	 




	We have limited selling, marketing and manufacturing resources,
	which may restrict our success in commercializing our TAEUS
	technology.




	 




	We currently do not have a sales, marketing, customer support or
	manufacturing team dedicated to our TAEUS clinical applications. To
	grow our business as planned, we must expand our sales, marketing,
	customer support and manufacturing capabilities. We must also
	establish satisfactory arrangements for the manufacture and
	distribution of our TAEUS applications, which will involve the
	development of our commercial infrastructure and/or collaborative
	commercial arrangements and partnerships. We may be unable to
	attract, retain and manage the specialized workforce and
	collaborative manufacturing and distribution arrangements necessary
	to successfully commercialize our products. In addition, developing
	these functions is time consuming and expensive. We intend to
	partner with others to assist us with some or all of these
	functions. However, we may be unable to find appropriate third
	parties with whom to enter into these arrangements. Furthermore, if
	we do enter into these arrangements, these third parties may not
	perform as expected.




	 




	If we experience problems in our relationships with our
	distributors, our ability to sell our products could be
	limited.




	 




	Because we are a small company with limited resources, we expect to
	depend on distributors to help promote market acceptance and demand
	for our products. Distributors that are in the business of selling
	other medical products may not devote a sufficient level of
	resources and support required to generate awareness of our
	products and grow or maintain product sales. If our distributors
	are unwilling or unable to market and sell our products, or if they
	do not perform to our expectations, we could experience delayed or
	reduced market acceptance and sales of our products. In addition,
	disagreements with our distributors or non-performance by these
	third parties could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation or
	arbitration and disrupt distribution channels for a period of time
	and require us to re-establish a distribution channel.




	 




	We have and may in the future form or seek additional strategic
	alliances, collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements, and
	we may not realize the benefits of such alliances, collaborations
	or licensing arrangements.




	 




	On April 22, 2016, we entered into a Collaborative Research
	Agreement with GE Healthcare under which GE Healthcare has agreed
	to support our efforts to commercialize our TAEUS technology for
	use in an NAFLD application by, among other things, providing
	equipment and technical advice and facilitating introductions to GE
	Healthcare clinical ultrasound customers. This agreement does not
	commit GE Healthcare to a long-term relationship and it may
	disengage with us at any time. This agreement has a term of one
	year and is subject to termination by either party upon not less
	than 60 days’ notice. On April 21, 2017, we and GE Healthcare
	entered into an amendment to our agreement, extending its term by
	one year to April 22, 2018.




	 






	 




	23










	 






	 




	We intend in the future to form or seek additional strategic
	alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into
	licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will
	complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts
	with respect to our technologies and applications.




	 




	Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring
	and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures,
	issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt
	our management and business. In addition, we face significant
	competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the
	negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. If we license
	technologies or applications, we may not be able to realize the
	benefit of such transactions. Further, strategic alliances and
	collaborations are subject to numerous risks, which may include the
	following:




	 






	●




	collaborators
	have significant discretion in determining the efforts and
	resources that they will apply to a collaboration;






	 






	●




	collaborators
	may not pursue development and commercialization of our
	technologies and applications or may elect not to continue or renew
	development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial
	results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of
	competitive products, availability of funding, or other external
	factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or
	creates competing priorities;






	 






	●




	collaborators
	may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a
	clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon the development of
	an application, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a
	new formulation of an application for clinical
	testing;






	 






	●




	collaborators
	could independently develop, or develop with third parties,
	products that compete directly or indirectly with our applications
	and technologies;






	 






	●




	a
	collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more
	applications may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing
	and distribution;






	 






	●




	collaborators
	may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property
	rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary
	information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened
	litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual
	property or proprietary information or expose us to potential
	liability;






	 






	●




	disputes
	may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or
	termination of the research, development or commercialization of
	our technologies and applications, or that result in costly
	litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and
	resources;






	 






	●




	collaborations
	may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for
	additional capital to pursue further development or
	commercialization of the applicable applications or technologies;
	and






	 






	●




	collaborators
	may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that
	results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we
	would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such
	intellectual property.






	 




	As a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and
	strategic partnerships or license our applications or technologies,
	we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if
	we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing
	operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or
	otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain
	that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve
	the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction.
	Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements
	related to our applications could delay the development and
	commercialization of our technologies and applications in certain
	geographies or for certain applications, which would harm our
	business prospects, financial condition and results of
	operations.




	 






	 




	24










	 






	 




	We intend to market our TAEUS applications, if approved, globally,
	in which case we will be subject to the risks of doing business
	outside of the United States.




	 




	Because we intend to market our TAEUS applications, if approved,
	globally, our business may be subject to risks associated with
	doing business globally. Accordingly, our business and financial
	results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety
	of factors, including:




	 






	●




	changes
	in a specific country’s or region’s political and
	cultural climate or economic condition;






	 






	●




	unexpected
	changes in laws and regulatory requirements in local
	jurisdictions;






	 






	●




	difficulty
	of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local
	jurisdictions;






	 






	●




	inadequate
	intellectual property protection in certain countries;






	 






	●




	trade-protection
	measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export
	Administration Regulations promulgated by the United States
	Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or
	revocation of export privileges;






	 






	●




	effects
	of applicable local tax structures and potentially adverse tax
	consequences; and






	 






	●




	significant
	adverse changes in currency exchange rates.






	 




	We depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more
	key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled
	employees could harm our business.




	 




	Our success largely depends upon the continued services of our
	executive management team and key employees and the loss of one or
	more of our executive officers or key employees could harm us and
	directly impact our financial results. Our employees may terminate
	their employment with us at any time. Our executive management team
	has significant experience and knowledge of medical devices and
	ultrasound systems, and the loss of any team member could impair
	our ability to design, identify, and develop new intellectual
	property and new scientific or product ideas. Additionally, if we
	lose the services of any of these persons, we would likely be
	forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of
	replacements, which may result in a delay in the implementation of
	our business plan and plan of operations. We can give no assurance
	that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals
	on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to
	us.




	 




	To execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly
	qualified personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense,
	especially for engineers with high levels of experience in
	designing and developing medical devices and for sales executives,
	especially with industry expertise. We may experience difficulty in
	hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications.
	Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced
	personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, we
	invest significant time and expense in training our employees,
	which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit
	them. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and
	motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth
	prospects would be harmed. 




	 






	 




	25










	 






	 



	Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial
	partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper
	activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and
	requirements.




	 





	We are exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal
	activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants,
	commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could
	include intentional, reckless and negligent conduct that fails to:
	comply with the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or the FD&C
	Act, and similar laws of other countries, and rules and regulations
	of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and other
	similar foreign regulatory bodies; provide true, complete and
	accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign
	regulatory bodies; comply with manufacturing standards we
	establish; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the
	United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or
	report financial information or data accurately or to disclose
	unauthorized activities to us. If we obtain European, Chinese or
	FDA approval of any of our products and begin commercializing those
	products in Europe, China or the United States, respectively, our
	potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and
	our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely
	to increase. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of
	healthcare items and services, as well as certain business
	arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive
	laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other
	abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or
	prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and
	promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive
	programs and other business arrangements generally. It is not
	always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and
	other parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent
	this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or
	unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental
	investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure
	to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are
	instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending
	ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a
	significant impact on our business, including the imposition of
	significant fines or other sanctions.




	 




	Misdiagnosis, warranty and other claims initiated against us and
	product field actions could increase our costs, delay or reduce our
	sales and damage our reputation, adversely affecting our financial
	condition.




	 




	Our business exposes us to the risk of malpractice, warranty or
	product liability claims inherent in the sale and support of
	medical device products, including those based on claims that the
	use or failure of one of our products resulted in a misdiagnosis or
	harm to a patient. Such claims may cause financial loss, damage our
	reputation by raising questions about our products’ safety
	and efficacy, adversely affect regulatory approvals and interfere
	with our efforts to market our products. Although to date we have
	not been involved in any medical malpractice or product liability
	litigation, we may incur significant liability if such litigation
	were to occur. We may also face adverse publicity resulting from
	product field actions or regulatory proceedings brought against us.
	Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.
	If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product
	liability or related claims, we may incur substantial liabilities
	or be required to limit distribution of our products. Even a
	successful defense would require significant financial and
	management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome,
	liability claims may result in:




	 






	●




	decreased
	demand for our products; 






	 






	●




	injury
	to our reputation and negative media attention; 






	 






	●




	initiation
	of investigations by regulators; 






	 






	●




	costs
	to defend the related litigation; 






	 






	●




	a
	diversion of management’s time and our
	resources; 






	 






	●




	substantial
	monetary awards to trial participants or
	patients; 






	 






	●




	product
	recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional
	restrictions; 






	 






	●




	loss
	of revenue; 






	 






	●




	exhaustion
	of any available insurance and our capital
	resources; 






	 






	●




	the
	inability to commercialize a product at all or for particular
	applications; and 






	 






	●




	a
	decline in the price of our securities.






	 






	 




	26










	 






	 




	Although we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts we
	believe are commercially reasonable, any liability we incur may
	exceed our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies may also have
	various exclusions, and we may be subject to a claim for which we
	have no coverage. Liability insurance is expensive and may cease to
	be available on acceptable terms, if at all. A malpractice,
	warranty, product liability or other claim or product field action
	not covered by our insurance or exceeding our coverage could
	significantly impair our financial condition. In addition, a
	product field action or a liability claim against us could
	significantly harm our reputation and make it more difficult to
	obtain the funding and commercial relationships necessary to
	maintain our business.




	 




	Our internal computer systems, or those used by third-party
	manufacturers or other contractors or consultants, may fail or
	suffer security breaches.




	 




	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal
	computer systems and those of our future manufacturers and other
	contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer
	viruses and unauthorized access. Although to our knowledge we have
	not experienced any such material system failure or security breach
	to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in
	our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our
	development programs and our business operations. To the extent
	that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of,
	or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure
	of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur
	liability and the further development and commercialization of our
	products could be delayed.




	 




	Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our
	business.




	 




	Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including inflation,
	recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may result in
	lower consumer healthcare spending as well as physician and
	hospital spending and availability of credit. If demand for medical
	devices or budgets for capital improvements decline, our revenue
	could be adversely affected. Additionally, if our suppliers face
	challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products or
	otherwise in operating their businesses, they may become unable to
	continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products,
	which could result in sales disruption.




	 




	We may face significant challenges if global economic conditions
	remain unstable or worsen, including reduced demand for our
	products and services, increased order cancellations, longer sales
	cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; increased
	difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and increased risk of
	excess and obsolete inventories; increased price competition in our
	served markets; increased prices in components as a result of
	higher commodities prices; supply chain interruptions, which could
	disrupt our ability to produce our products; and increased risk of
	impairment of investments, goodwill and intangible and long-lived
	assets.




	 




	The United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union will
	have uncertain effects and could adversely affect us.




	 




	The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a
	majority of voters voted to exit the European Union, commonly
	referred to as “Brexit”. Negotiations are expected to
	commence to determine the future terms of the United
	Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union, including,
	among other things, the terms of trade between the United Kingdom
	and the European Union. The effects of Brexit will depend on any
	agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to E.U.
	markets either during a transitional period or more permanently.
	Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and
	market conditions and could contribute to instability in global
	financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the
	value of the Sterling and Euro. In addition, Brexit could lead to
	legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and
	regulations as the United Kingdom determines which E.U. laws to
	replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we
	cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of
	operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	 




	Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal
	Matters




	 




	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, then our
	financial condition, results of operations and the value of our
	technology and products could be adversely affected.




	 




	Much of our value arises out of our proprietary technology and
	intellectual property for the design, manufacture and use of
	medical imaging systems, including development of our TAEUS
	applications. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and
	trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and limit the
	ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar
	technology. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our
	intellectual property, which could harm our business.




	 






	 




	27










	 






	 




	We currently maintain a patent portfolio consisting of one current
	granted patent and twelve pending patent applications in the United
	States and foreign jurisdictions relating to our technology. In
	addition, we currently license eight granted patents and three
	pending patent applications in the United States and foreign
	jurisdictions. We or our licensor may fail to maintain these
	patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against entities
	that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such
	enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily
	would.




	 




	Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is
	difficult, costly and time-intensive. We may fail to stop or
	prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in
	countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to
	the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Proceedings to
	enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in
	non-U.S. jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert
	our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. If we
	cannot prevent other companies from using our proprietary
	technology or if our patents are found invalid or otherwise
	unenforceable, we may be unable to compete effectively against
	other manufacturers of ultrasound systems, which could decrease our
	market share. In addition, the breach of a patent licensing
	agreement by us may result in termination of a patent
	license.




	 




	If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary
	information and know-how, the value of our technology and products
	could be adversely affected.




	 




	In addition to our patent activities, we rely upon, among other
	things, unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets
	and know-how. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by
	third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could
	enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological
	achievements, potentially eroding our competitive position in our
	market. We seek to protect confidential or proprietary information
	in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees,
	consultants and third parties. While we require all of our
	employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have
	access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to
	enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that
	this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or
	that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade
	secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent
	information and techniques. These agreements may be terminated or
	breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such
	termination or breach. Furthermore, these agreements may not
	provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how in
	the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that any
	of our staff was previously employed by other pharmaceutical,
	medical technology or biotechnology companies, those employers may
	allege violations of trade secrets and other similar claims in
	relation to their former employee’s therapeutic development
	activities for us.




	 




	We may in the future be a party to intellectual property litigation
	or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could
	interfere with our ability to sell our TAEUS
	applications.




	 




	The medical device industry has been characterized by extensive
	litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other
	intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have
	used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive
	advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending
	patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may
	be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of
	misappropriating third parties’ trade secrets. Other medical
	imaging market participants, many of which have substantially
	greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent
	portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies,
	may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or
	obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise
	interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our
	products or to use product names. We may become a party to patent
	or trademark infringement or trade secret claims and litigation as
	a result of these and other third party intellectual property
	rights being asserted against us. The defense and prosecution of
	these matters are both costly and time consuming. Vendors from whom
	we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event
	that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third
	party’s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third
	party’s trade secret.




	 




	Further, if such patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are
	successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and
	result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products,
	license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court
	costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe
	third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade
	secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to
	other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and
	other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area
	have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements,
	costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and
	could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain
	necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not
	obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our TAEUS
	applications to avoid infringement.




	 




	Similarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third
	parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or
	USPTO, may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or
	other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent
	applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings,
	such as re-examination, inter partes review, or opposition
	proceedings, before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating
	to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property
	rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or
	administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses
	could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our TAEUS
	applications or using product names, which would have a significant
	adverse impact on our business.




	 






	 




	28










	 






	 




	Additionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to
	enforce our patents or trademarks, to protect our trade secrets or
	know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of
	the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in
	substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by
	our technical and management personnel. We may not prevail in any
	lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies
	awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. We may not be
	able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that
	are the same or similar to our products or from using product names
	that are the same or similar to our product names, and our business
	may be harmed as a result.




	 




	Intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection,
	which may permit third parties to compete against us more
	effectively.




	 




	In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain
	protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely
	on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret
	laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to
	protect our intellectual property rights. Any patents issued to us
	may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third
	parties may independently develop similar or competing technology
	that avoids our patents. Should such challenges be successful,
	competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing
	processes that are substantially similar to ours. We may not be
	able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical
	knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former
	or current employees, despite the existence generally of
	confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions.
	Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual
	property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have
	taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In
	addition, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our
	intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the
	United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our
	proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could
	affect our ability to expand to international markets or require
	costly efforts to protect our technology. To the extent our
	intellectual property protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a
	greater risk of direct competition. In addition, competitors could
	purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the
	competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or
	design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure,
	protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could
	substantially harm the value of our TAEUS platform, brand and
	business.




	 




	Risks Related to Government Regulation




	 




	Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our
	business.




	 




	Our business is or in the future may be subject to regulation by
	various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies,
	including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing
	employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws,
	consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export
	controls, securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain
	jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent
	than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable
	regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations,
	sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, adverse
	publicity, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and
	criminal penalties or injunctions and administrative actions. If
	any governmental sanctions, fines or penalties are imposed, or if
	we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our
	business, operating results and financial condition could be
	harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in
	a significant diversion of management's attention and our resources
	and substantial costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could
	further harm our business, operating results and financial
	condition.

	If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances
	or approvals for our TAEUS applications, or if clearances or
	approvals for future applications and indications are delayed or
	not issued, our commercial operations will be harmed.




	 




	The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to
	regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the
	FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These
	agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with
	applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing,
	manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical
	devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of
	regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device.
	Governmental regulations specific to medical devices are
	wide-ranging and govern, among other things:




	 






	●




	product
	design, development and manufacture;






	 






	●




	laboratory,
	pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging storage and
	distribution;






	 






	●




	premarketing
	clearance or approval;






	 






	●




	record
	keeping;






	 






	●




	product
	marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution;
	and






	 






	●




	post-marketing
	surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and
	recalls and correction and removals.






	 




	In the European Union, we will be required to comply with
	applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices
	Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and
	obtain CE mark certification in order to market medical devices.
	The CE mark is applied following approval from an independent
	notified body or declaration of conformity. It is an international
	symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance
	with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We believe
	that our TAEUS applications will qualify for sale in the European
	Union as Class IIa medical devices. Existing regulations do not
	require clinical trials to obtain CE marks for Class IIa medical
	devices. However, in 2012 the European Commission proposed a new
	regulatory scheme that, if implemented, will impose significant
	additional obligations on medical device companies. Expected
	changes include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and
	pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new
	classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third
	party testing by government accredited groups for some types of
	medical devices, and tightened and streamlined quality management
	system assessment procedures. It is anticipated that this new
	regulatory scheme may be implemented prior to receipt of the CE
	mark for our NAFLD TAEUS application but we believe that applicable
	transition rules should allow us to avoid their application in that
	case. However, such new rules could impose additional requirements,
	such as a requirement to conduct clinical trials, on future CE mark
	applications we make.




	 




	We are also required to comply with the regulations of each other
	country where we commercialize products, such as the requirement
	that we obtain approval from the FDA and the China Food and Drug
	Administration before we can launch new products in the United
	States and China, respectively.




	 




	International sales of medical devices manufactured in the United
	States that are not approved by the FDA for use in the United
	States, or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance
	standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices
	are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which
	the device is exported. Frequently, regulatory approval may first
	be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the United
	States due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other
	countries, such as China for example, require approval in the
	country of origin first.




	 






	 




	30










	 






	 




	Before a new medical device or a new intended use for an existing
	product can be marketed in the United States, a company must first
	submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or premarketing
	approval, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The
	typical duration to receive a 510(k) approval is approximately nine
	to twelve months from the date of the initial 510(k) submission and
	the typical duration to receive a PMA approval is approximately two
	years from the date of submission of the initial PMA application,
	although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be
	longer.




	 




	We expect all of our products to be classified as Class II medical
	devices that may be approved by means of a 510(k) clearance. In the
	past, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing has required only
	proof of substantial equivalence in technology for a given
	indication with a previously cleared device. Recently, there has
	been a trend of the FDA requiring additional clinical work to prove
	efficacy in addition to technological equivalence and basic safety.
	Whether clinical data is provided or not, the FDA may decide to
	reject the substantial equivalence argument we present. If that
	happens, the device is automatically designated as a Class III
	device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA
	requirements, or can request a risk-based classification
	determination for the device in accordance with the “de
	novo” process, which may determine that the new device is of
	low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately be regulated
	as a Class I or II device. Thus, although at this time we do not
	anticipate that we will be required to do so, it is possible that
	one or more of our other products may require approval through the
	510(K) de novo process or by means of a PMA.




	 




	We may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals
	or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our
	business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances
	or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the
	indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the
	product. Therefore, even if we believe we have successfully
	developed our TAEUS technology, we may not be permitted to market
	TAEUS applications in the United States if we do not obtain FDA
	regulatory clearance to market such applications. Delays in
	obtaining clearance or approval could increase our costs and harm
	our revenues and growth. 




	 




	In addition, we are required to timely file various reports with
	the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting
	regulations that require us to report to certain regulatory
	authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a
	death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely
	cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction
	were to recur. If these reports are not filed timely, regulators
	may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer, and we
	may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement
	actions, all of which could harm our business.




	 




	If we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to
	reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required
	to submit a publically available Correction and Removal report to
	the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory
	agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device
	recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other
	international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the
	quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of
	these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us
	in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase
	decisions or cancel orders and would harm our
	reputation.




	 




	The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the
	advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims
	we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there
	are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and
	that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor
	misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of
	our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not
	substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement
	actions, including warning letters, and we may be required to
	revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or
	restitutions.




	 






	 




	31










	 






	 




	The FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our
	failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could
	result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which
	may include any of the following sanctions:




	 






	●




	adverse
	publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and
	civil penalties;






	 






	●




	repair,
	replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our
	products;






	 






	●




	operating
	restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of
	production;






	 






	●




	refusing
	our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new
	products, new intended uses or modifications to existing
	products;






	 






	●




	withdrawing
	510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been
	granted; and






	 






	●




	criminal
	prosecution.






	 




	If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial
	condition would be harmed.




	 




	Our TAEUS applications may require recertification or new
	regulatory clearances or premarket approvals and we may be required
	to recall or cease marketing our TAEUS applications until such
	recertification or clearances are obtained.




	 




	Most countries outside of the United States require that product
	approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five
	years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any
	device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the
	device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document
	continued compliance. Where recertification applications are
	required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our
	products in those countries.




	 




	In the United States, material modifications to the intended use or
	technological characteristics of our TAEUS applications will
	require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals or require us
	to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these
	clearances or approvals are obtained. Based on FDA published
	guidelines, the FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make
	and document a determination of whether or not a modification
	requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, the FDA
	can review a manufacturer’s decision. Any modification to an
	FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or
	efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended
	use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket
	approval.




	 




	We may not be able to obtain recertification or additional 510(k)
	clearances or premarket approvals for our applications or for
	modifications to, or additional indications for, our TAEUS
	technology in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining
	required future governmental approvals would harm our ability to
	introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in
	turn would harm our future growth. If foreign regulatory
	authorities or the FDA require additional approvals, we may be
	required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our TAEUS
	applications, which could harm our operating results and require us
	to redesign our applications. In these circumstances, we may be
	subject to significant enforcement actions.




	 




	If we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA’s Quality
	System Regulations or other regulatory bodies’ equivalent
	regulations, our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut
	down and TAEUS platform sales could suffer.




	 




	Our manufacturing processes and those of our third party suppliers
	will be required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System
	Regulations and other regulatory bodies’ equivalent
	regulations, which cover the procedures and documentation of the
	design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling,
	packaging, storage and shipping of our TAEUS applications. We will
	also be subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In
	addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting
	and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records
	for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies,
	including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in
	other countries. If we fail such an inspection, our operations
	could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to
	take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse
	inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our
	manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of
	marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our
	products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of
	which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key
	component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be
	in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may
	result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our
	results of operations to suffer.




	 






	 




	32










	 






	 




	Our TAEUS applications may in the future be subject to product
	recalls that could harm our reputation.




	 




	Governmental authorities in Europe, the United States and China
	have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products
	in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in
	design or manufacture. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by
	us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing
	errors or design or labeling defects. Recalls of our TAEUS
	applications would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm
	our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and
	results of operations. A recall announcement would negatively
	affect the price of our securities.




	 




	Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our planned
	products' commercial success.




	 




	There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number
	of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in
	ways that could harm our future revenues and profitability and the
	future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. In
	the European Union, although there have not been any recent
	amendments to the relevant regulatory legislation, there are
	ongoing discussions regarding amending the current regulatory
	framework for medical devices. Moreover, because the Medical
	Devices Directive requires only minimum harmonization in the
	European Union, member countries may alter their enforcement of the
	directives or amend their national regulatory rules. We cannot
	predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented by
	the European Union or E.U. member countries, or the effect any
	future legislation or regulation will have on
	us. 




	 




	In the United States, federal and state lawmakers regularly propose
	and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant
	changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to
	contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For
	example, one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in
	decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended
	by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act,
	or Affordable Care Act, was enacted in 2010. The Affordable Care
	Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing
	enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes
	and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing
	government healthcare programs and will result in the development
	of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things,
	imposes an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of most medical devices,
	including ours, and any failure to pay this amount could result in
	the imposition of an injunction on the sale of our products, fines
	and penalties.




	 




	It remains unclear whether changes will be made to the Affordable
	Care Act, or whether it will be repealed or materially modified. We
	cannot assure you that the Affordable Care Act, as currently
	enacted or as amended or discontinued in the future, will not harm
	our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future
	federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to
	healthcare reform will affect our business.




	 




	There likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory
	proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or
	lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives
	that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The
	continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed
	care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to
	contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm:




	 






	●




	our
	ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our
	products;






	 






	●




	our
	ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;
	and






	 






	●




	the
	availability of capital.






	 






	 




	33










	 






	 




	If we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face
	substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial
	condition could be adversely affected.




	 




	Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare
	services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third
	party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and
	regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’
	rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be
	subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy
	regulation by both the federal government and the states in which
	we conduct our business. Other jurisdictions such as the European
	Union have similar laws. The regulations that will affect how we
	operate include:




	 






	●




	the
	federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits,
	among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully
	offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly
	or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of
	an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any
	good or service for which payment may be made under federal
	healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid
	programs;






	 






	●




	the
	federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things,
	individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be
	presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to
	obtain payment from the federal government;






	 






	●




	federal
	criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any
	healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to
	healthcare matters;






	 






	●




	the
	federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the
	Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which
	require manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and
	medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare,
	Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to
	report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
	Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other
	transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as
	well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and
	their immediate family members;






	 






	●




	HIPAA,
	as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and
	Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain
	electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and
	privacy of protected health information; and






	 






	●




	state
	law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as
	anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or
	services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial
	insurers.






	 




	The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent
	requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal
	healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to
	have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate
	it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the
	government may assert that a claim including items or services
	resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
	constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False
	Claims Act.




	 




	Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with
	applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is
	possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will
	conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or
	future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable
	fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any
	such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful
	in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could
	have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition
	of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages,
	disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation
	in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and similar foreign
	healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm,
	diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our
	operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our
	business and our results of operations.




	 






	 




	34










	 






	 




	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be
	expensive. Failure to comply with environmental laws and
	regulations could subject us to significant liability.




	 




	Our research and development and manufacturing operations may
	involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a
	variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and
	regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal,
	remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the
	sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of
	products containing hazardous substances. In addition, our research
	and development and manufacturing operations produce biological
	waste materials, such as human and animal tissue, and waste
	solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol. These operations are permitted
	by regulatory authorities, and the resultant waste materials are
	disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and
	regulations. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can
	be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence.
	Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive
	and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines
	and penalties, personal injury and third part property damage
	claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs.
	Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over
	time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and
	penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that
	violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the
	future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error,
	accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense
	associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm
	our financial condition and operating results.

	Risks Related to Owning Our Securities, Our Financial Results and
	Our Need for Financing

	●




	our
	ability to attract new customers and grow our business with
	existing customers;






	 






	●




	the

	Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our cash
	position, requiring us to raise additional capital which may be on
	unfavorable terms and result in substantial dilution.




	 




	If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal
	control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in
	the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the
	market price of our securities may decrease.




	 




	As a public company, we are be required to maintain internal
	control over financial reporting and to report any material
	weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), requires
	that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal
	control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual
	report for the year ending December 31, 2018, provide a
	management report on our internal control over financial reporting,
	which must be attested to by our independent registered public
	accounting firm to the extent we are no longer an “emerging
	growth company,” as defined by the Jumpstart Our Businesses
	Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act").




	 




	Currently, we have material weaknesses in our internal control over
	financial reporting and, as a result, we may not detect errors on a
	timely basis and our financial statements may be materially
	misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing our
	internal control over financial reporting, which process will be
	time consuming, costly and complicated. However, we are a small
	organization with limited management resources. In addition to
	serving as our Chief Financial Officer, David Wells provides
	financial consulting services to several other companies. These
	other consulting services could prevent Mr. Wells from dedicating
	sufficient time and attention to us, which could limit our ability
	to maintain effective internal controls over financial
	reporting.




	 




	Until such time as we are no longer an “emerging growth
	company” or a smaller reporting company, our auditors will
	not be required to attest as to our internal control over financial
	reporting. If we continue to identify material weaknesses in our
	internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to
	comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely
	manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over
	financial reporting is effective or, once required, if our
	independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest
	that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,
	investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of
	our financial reports and the market price of our securities could
	decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other
	third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock
	exchange on which our securities are listed, the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or other regulatory authorities,
	which could require additional financial and management resources
	and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other
	remedies.




	 




	We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at
	all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain
	financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate
	our product development programs and commercialization
	efforts.




	 




	We believe that our current cash, including the net proceeds from
	our initial public offering, and expected revenues from operations
	will be sufficient for us to fund the development and regulatory
	approval and to initiate the commercialization of our NAFLD TAEUS
	application in the European Union. However, , we expect that we
	will need to finance the full commercialization of this application
	in the European Union and to complete the development of any other
	TAEUS application through public or private equity offerings, debt
	financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or
	other financing alternatives. 




	 






	 




	37










	 






	 




	To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of
	our Nexus 128 system and net proceeds from the issuance of
	securities. We do not know when or if our operations will generate
	sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we
	may require additional capital in order to (i) continue to
	conduct research and development activities; (ii) conduct
	clinical studies; (iii) fund the costs of seeking regulatory
	approval of TAEUS applications; (iv) expand our sales and
	marketing infrastructure; (v) acquire complementary business
	technology or products; or (vi) respond to business
	opportunities, challenges, increased regulatory obligations or
	unforeseen circumstances. Our forecast of the period of time
	through which our financial resources will be adequate to support
	our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks
	and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a
	number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in
	this “Risk Factors” section. We have based this
	estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could
	utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently
	expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many
	factors, including, but not limited to:




	 






	●




	the
	costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews associated with
	our future products, including
	TAEUS applications;






	 






	●




	the
	costs and expenses of expanding our sales and marketing
	infrastructure;






	 






	●




	the
	costs and timing of developing variations of our
	TAEUS applications and, if necessary, obtaining
	regulatory clearance of such variations;






	 






	●




	the
	degree of success we experience in commercializing our products,
	particularly our TAEUS applications;






	 






	●




	the
	extent to which our TAEUS applications are adopted by
	hospitals for use by primary care physicians, hepatologists,
	radiologists and oncologists for diagnosis of fatty liver disease
	and the thermal ablation of lesions;






	 






	●




	the
	number and types of future products we develop and
	commercialize;






	 






	●




	the
	costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and
	maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related
	claims;






	 






	●




	the
	extent and scope of our general and administrative
	expenses;






	 






	●




	the
	progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including
	the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential
	future clinical trials;






	 






	●




	the
	outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals, including the
	potential that the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may
	require that we perform more studies than those that we currently
	expect;






	 






	●




	the
	amount of sales and other revenues from technologies and products
	that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for
	such potential products and the availability of adequate
	third-party reimbursement;






	 






	●




	selling
	and marketing costs associated with our potential products,
	including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales
	capabilities;






	 






	●




	the
	terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing
	or other arrangements that we may establish;






	 






	●




	cash
	requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of
	other products;






	 






	●




	the
	costs of operating as a public company;






	 






	●




	the
	cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale, outsourced
	manufacturing activities; and






	 






	●




	the
	time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market
	developments.






	 




	We may raise funds in equity or debt financings or enter into
	credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs.
	Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to
	incur debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants
	relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and
	operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to
	obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we
	raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible
	debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant
	dilution in their percentage ownership of our Company, and any new
	equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and
	privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. General
	market conditions or the market price of our common stock may not
	support capital raising transactions such as a public or private
	offering of our common stock or other securities. If we are unable
	to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to
	us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of
	one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and
	marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to
	commercialize our products. In addition, if we raise additional
	funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing,
	distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may
	have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future
	revenue streams or products or to grant licenses on terms that may
	not be favorable to us.




	 






	 




	38










	 






	 




	If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be required
	to curtail the development of our technology or materially curtail
	or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of
	our rights or assets. Any inability to raise adequate funds on
	commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, results of operation and financial condition,
	including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our
	business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to
	investors.




	 




	We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and
	could divert management attention.




	 




	The price of our securities may be volatile, and in the past
	companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of
	their securities have been subject to an increased incidence of
	securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this
	type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us
	could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s
	attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm
	our business.




	 




	We are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act
	and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements
	applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities
	less attractive to investors.




	 




	We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the
	Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and
	we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
	requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
	not “emerging growth companies” including, but not
	limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor
	attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
	reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
	our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
	requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
	compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
	payments not previously approved.  We cannot predict if
	investors will find our securities less attractive because we may
	rely on these exemptions.  If some investors find our
	securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active
	trading market for our securities and the price of our securities
	may be more volatile.




	 




	We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to
	five years after the date of our initial public offering, although
	we will lose that status sooner if our annual revenues exceed $1
	billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt
	in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock
	that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June
	30.




	 




	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports
	about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our
	business, the price of our securities and trading volume could
	decline.




	 




	The trading market for our securities is influenced by the research
	and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us
	or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain
	research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few
	analysts commence research coverage of us, or one or more of the
	analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about our company,
	the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of
	these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly
	publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial
	markets, which in turn could cause the price of our securities or
	trading volume to decline. 




	 




	We have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans
	to pay dividends.




	 




	We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have
	earnings, in order to further develop our technology and potential
	products and to cover operating costs.  We do not plan to
	pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the
	foreseeable future.  We cannot assure you that we will,
	at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be
	available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a
	dividend.  




	 




	Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers,
	directors and significant stockholders may prevent new investors
	from influencing significant corporate decisions.




	 




	All decisions with respect to the management of the Company will be
	made by our board of directors and our officers, who beneficially
	own approximately 6.3% of our common stock, as calculated in
	accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). This
	control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of
	control of the Company or changes in management, which in turn
	could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the
	Company’s securities or prevent stockholders from realizing a
	premium over the market price for their securities.




	 






	 




	39










	 






	 




	We incur significant costs as a result of becoming a public company
	that reports to the SEC and our management is required to devote
	substantial time to meet compliance obligations.




	 




	As a public company listed in the United States, we incur
	significant legal, accounting and other expenses.  We are
	subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by
	the SEC and Nasdaq that impose significant requirements on public
	companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of
	effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in
	corporate governance practices.  In addition, in 2010,
	the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the
	Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted.  There are significant
	corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions
	in the Dodd-Frank Act that contribute to our legal and financial
	compliance costs, make some activities more difficult,
	time-consuming or costly and also place undue strain on our
	personnel, systems and resources.  Our management and
	other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to
	these compliance initiatives.  In addition, these rules
	and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for
	us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may
	be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
	substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
	coverage.  As a result, it may be more difficult for us
	to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of
	directors, our board committees or as executive
	officers.




	 




	A significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common
	stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the
	market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our
	securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing
	well.




	 




	Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the
	public market could occur in the future. These sales, or the
	perception in the market that the holders of a large number of
	securities intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of
	our common stock. We currently have outstanding 3,907,027 shares of
	common stock. Of these outstanding shares, approximately
	1,975,027 are restricted under securities laws or as a result of
	lock-up agreements but will be able to be resold in the near
	future. We also intend to register all shares of common stock that
	we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Once we register
	these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon
	issuance and once vested, subject to 180- and 365-day lock-up
	periods under certain lock-up agreements.




	 




	Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to
	purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive
	plan, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our
	stockholders and could cause the price of our securities to
	fall.




	 




	We expect that significant capital will be needed in the future to
	continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise capital by
	issuing common stock, convertible securities or other equity
	securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution,
	and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing
	stockholders.




	 




	Our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that
	stockholders consider favorable.




	 




	Certain provisions of our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate
	of Incorporation (our “Certificate of Incorporation”)
	and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or
	discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in
	control or change in our management, including transactions in
	which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their
	shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem
	to be in their best interests.  The provisions in our
	Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws:




	 






	●




	authorize
	our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder
	approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of
	each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the
	number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include
	terms that may deter an acquisition of us;






	 






	●




	limit
	who may call stockholder meetings;






	 






	●




	do
	not provide for cumulative voting rights; and






	 






	●




	provide
	that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
	majority of directors then in office, even if less than a
	quorum.






	 










	 




	40










	 






	 




	In addition, section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
	limits our ability to engage in any business combination with a
	person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting
	stock unless certain conditions are satisfied.  This
	restriction lasts for a period of three years following any such
	person’s share acquisition.  These provisions may
	have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive
	stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential
	acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices.  This
	potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the
	price of our common stock.




	 




	Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect
	all errors or acts of fraud.




	 




	We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
	Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
	to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by
	us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
	accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified by the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any
	disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and
	procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
	only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
	control system are met.




	 




	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
	decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
	because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
	circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
	of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the
	controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our
	control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
	not be detected.

	Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered

	Convertible Notes




	 




	In
	March 2017, we extended our 2016 offering of convertible promissory
	notes by $250,000. The extension was made available only to
	existing noteholders and $225,000 of the offering was subscribed.
	The class of promissory notes converted into shares of our common
	stock immediately prior to the completion of our initial public
	offering at an effective conversion price of $1.40 per share, after
	the one-for-3.5 reverse stock split that the Company effected on
	May 8, 2017 (the “Reverse Split”). Except as otherwise
	noted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all share numbers are
	presented on a post Reverse Split basis. In connection with the
	issuances of the foregoing securities, the Company relied on the
	exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions not involving
	a public offering. We used the funds received from the issuance of
	these convertible notes for working capital.




	 




	Use of Proceeds from Offering of Registered Securities




	 




	On May
	8, 2017, our Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (Reg.
	No. 333-193522) was declared effective by the SEC and, on May 8,
	2017, our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Reg. No. 333-217788)
	became effective upon filing with the SEC each such Registration
	Statement was filed in connection with our initial public offering,
	pursuant to which we sold 1,932,000 units, each consisting of one
	share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of
	our common stock, at a price to the public of $5.00 per unit, which
	amount includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option
	to purchase additional units. The common stock and warrants
	comprising each unit are not immediately separable and will begin
	trading separately on July 10, 2017, which is the first day
	following the 60th day after the date of the final prospectus filed
	with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act on
	May 10, 2017 (the “Prospectus”), or such earlier date
	as may be determined by National Securities Corporation, as
	representative of the underwriters of the offering. Each warrant is
	exercisable for a share of our common stock at a price of $6.25 per
	share. The offering closed on May 12, 2017 and the underwriters
	exercised their overallotment option as of May 22, 2017, as a
	result of which we raised net proceeds of approximately $8.6
	million after deducting approximately $773,000 in underwriting
	discounts, commissions and expenses and approximately $297,000 in
	offering expenses payable by us. National Securities Corporation
	and Dougherty & Company LLC were the underwriters for the
	offering. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or
	persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their
	associates, or to our affiliates, other than payments in the
	ordinary course of business to officers for salaries and to
	non-employee directors as compensation for board or board committee
	service.




	 




	There
	has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our
	initial public offering as described in the
	Prospectus.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap N/A     Shares Outstanding 3.91 M     Public Float N/A     Yield NDRA has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.22      Net Money Flow ()  -1,210    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.               Advertisement         Competitors NDRA   Data not available.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
